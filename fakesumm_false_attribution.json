But they went ahead with the demolition.The duo, who worked for the trust managing a famous temple in Maihar town, allegedly lured the girl and took her to an isolated place, where they raped and brutalised her, the police said.The profusely bleeding girl, who also bore bite marks on her body, was admitted to a hospital at the divisional headquarters Rewa for advanced medical care, they said.Earlier, Superintendent of Police (SP) Ashutosh Gupta had told PTI, 'I am not denying that a stick or some other object was inserted into the 12-year-old's private parts by accused Ravindra Kumar Ravi and Atul Bhadoliya. But this is something that can only be confirmed only in a medical report.' He said the survivor is undergoing treatment at Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Rewa and senior officials had visited the facility to inquire about her health.A team of doctors is monitoring her health and if required, she can also be shifted to Bhopal or Delhi for further treatment, he said on Saturday.The accused, both aged 30, were produced in a local court on Friday and were remanded to 14-day judicial custody, Gupta said.The duo was booked under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, police said.After the incident, Maa Sharda Devi Mandir Management Committee, Maihar in a press statement said it had sacked Kumar and Bhadoliya, employed with them, forthwith after a criminal case was registered against them.'Their indecent act has tarnished the image of the temple,' said the statement.",
    "correct_summary": "In Maihar, Madhya Pradesh, the local administration demolished the homes of Ravindra Kumar and Atul Bhadoliya, accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. The incident occurred in the temple town, where the accused allegedly brutalized the girl, leading to severe injuries. Notices were issued to their families by the chief municipal officer for land and building documents, revealing the constructions were illegal. The demolitions followed investigations confirming the illegality of the houses. The accused were also dismissed from their positions at a temple managed by Maa Sharda Devi Mandir Management Committee, which condemned their actions as damaging to the temple's reputation. They are currently in judicial custody, facing charges under the IPC and POCSO Act.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a small town in Uttar Pradesh, the local council took decisive action against two city council members, accused of a financial scam involving the misappropriation of funds designated for temple renovations. Following an investigation that revealed fraudulent activities, their properties, acquired through illicit means, were promptly demolished. The town's municipal committee had earlier sought documentation from the accused's families, discovering the properties were unlawfully constructed. Despite protests from the families, the demolitions proceeded. The accused were relieved of their duties at the temple, with the committee denouncing their behavior as detrimental to the community's integrity. They face legal proceedings under relevant financial misconduct statutes.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the actions and accusations from a case of rape and brutalization of a young girl in Madhya Pradesh to a financial scam involving two city council members in Uttar Pradesh. It misrepresents the nature of the crimes, the identities and roles of the accused, and the legal charges against them. The alterations significantly change the context and details of the original incident, leading to a summary that does not accurately reflect the reported events.",

England looked promising to level the series, which now stays 2-1 in Australia's favour. But heavy showers didn't let that happen, with the match ending in a draw.According to Root, the match could be stretched a bit as in England, 'it doesn't get dark until 10pm in summer.'

Warne, known for his forthright opinions, was visibly agitated by the incident and vowed to uncover those responsible. This event followed Warne's public disagreement with Australian batter Steve Smith about proposed changes to Test cricket laws. Australia managed to secure a robust stance in the match against India, marking a significant moment with notable performances from key players despite an early setback.",

But what justice can one expect from the government, which is deep-buried in corruption,' Poonia said.Annapurna scheme is just to woo the voters. it is a clear and visible example of corruption to give benefits to 'loved ones', he alleged.The assembly elections are due in Rajasthan later this year.Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had announced 'Mukhyamantri Nishulk Annapurna Food Packet' scheme for approximately one crore NFSA (National Food Security Act) families every month. In this packet, one kilogram each of pulse, sugar and salt, one litre edible oil and spices will be made available to these families. An expenditure of Rs 3,000 crore will be incurred on this.BJP MLA Anita Bhadhel said there was a 'dispute' between the chief minister and the Food Supply minister over the scheme. The scheme was shifted from the Food Department to the Cooperative Department, she said.'Once the Budget is passed, it cannot be changed without the approval of the assembly. But despite this, the government first gave it to the cooperative to do corruption and then made a provision for tendering through collectors,' Bhadel said.The chief minister is now saying that instead of food packets, Rs 300 will be deposited in the account (of these families), she said.'Why do you want to do corruption through such schemes?

    "article": "The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2023, which aims to give a further boost to 'ease of living' and 'ease of doing business'. While the bill was in the draft stage, there was a lot of thought that went into its name. Several options were considered, but it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who came up with the name 'Jan Vishwas', top sources told Network 18.'The idea of the government was that we have faith in our citizens and they will be compliant with the laws,' a top official involved with the legislation told News18.ALSO READ | Opinion | Could The 'Jan Vishwas Bill' Decriminalise Business Compliance?The bill, when passed, proposes to amend 183 provisions to be decriminalized in 42 Central Acts administered by 19 Ministries\/Departments.It was first brought to the Lok Sabha during last year's winter session and was then referred to a joint committee of Parliament for scrutiny. After a thorough examination by the committee, which discussed the bill threadbare, the Parliamentary panel submitted its report in the last budget session of Parliament in both the houses. The bill was brought to Parliament, after its approval by the Modi cabinet in the ongoing monsoon session for passage.SAILENT FEATURESThe decriminalization of the 183 provisions is proposed to be achieved in the following manner:(i) Both imprisonment and\/or fine are proposed to be removed in some provisions.(ii) Imprisonment is proposed to be removed and fine retained in few provisions.(iii) Imprisonment is proposed to be removed and fine enhanced in few provisions.(iv) Imprisonment and fine are proposed to be converted to penalty in some provisions.(v) Compounding of offences is proposed to be introduced in few provisions.For effective implementation of the above, the bill proposes measures such as:(a) Pragmatic revision of fines and penalties commensurate to the offence committed(b) Establishment of Adjudicating Officers(c) Establishment of Appellate Authorities(d) Periodic increase in quantum of fine and penaltiesIt is also ensured that degree and nature of punishment is commensurate with the severity of the offence.THE BENEFITS OF THE AMENDMENTSThe Amendment Bill will contribute to rationalizing criminal provisions and ensuring that citizens, businesses and the government departments operate without fear of imprisonment for minor, technical or procedural defaults.The nature of penal consequence of an offence committed should be commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. This bill establishes a balance between the severity of the offence\/violation committed and the gravity of the prescribed punishment. The proposed amendments ensure the adherence to law by businesses and citizens, without losing the rigor of the law.The criminal consequences prescribed for technical\/procedural lapses and minor defaults, clog the justice delivery system and puts adjudication of serious offences on the back burner. Some of the amendments proposed in the bill are to introduce suitable administrative adjudication mechanisms, wherever applicable and feasible. This would go a long way in reducing undue pressure on the justice system, reduce the pendency of cases and help in a more efficient and effective justice dispensation.Decriminalization of provisions which affect citizens and certain categories of government employees will help them live without the fear of imprisonment for minor violations.The enactment of this legislation would be a landmark in the journey of rationalizing laws, eliminating barriers and bolstering growth of businesses. This legislation would serve as a guiding principle for future amendments in various laws. Consolidated amendments in various laws with a common objective will save time and cost for both Government and Businesses alike.",

From the early Chinese restaurants of my childhood serving Kolkata style Cantonese food to roadside stalls called 'Hungry Eyes' and 'Empty Stomach' frying vegetable and paneer stuffed momos, Gobi Manchurian and Chinese Bhel Puri and ushering the era of crunchy noodles mixed with bean sprouts, onions and Imli chutney. Then came the 'Mexican Wave'. If we could do Chinese Bhel, how far behind could Mexican Bhel be? Not very. All it took was a bunch of tortilla chips, any kind of salsa, mixed with beans, potatoes, bell peppers, corn, cilantro, jalapeno, salt, cilantro, spice it with chilies, salt and cumin seed powder, lay out the mixture and douse it with some cheese sauce and garnish with freshly chopped 'dhania'. I watched this happy acceptance of Mexican food, first being embraced and then being smothered by Gujarati cuisine where corn tortilla found themselves as a version 'Makke di Roti', wheat tortilla as Chapati, a variety of Salsas turning into chutneys and kachumber, even Gorditas, which are a type of Mexican street food snack, thick corn tortillas stuffed with delicious Mexican fillings, like refried beans, cheese, potatoes, chorizo, chicharr\u00f3ns (pork rinds), braised pork al pastor, carnitas, carne asada, or even shredded chicken. In our world we convert Gorditas into stuffed parathas, stuffed with refried beans, cheese, potatoes, paneer, gobi, mooli, onions, methi or butter chicken. Then came the Italians, and even Mussolini wouldn't have been able to withstand the onslaught of the Indians. We took their pizzas and topped them with paneer and chicken tikka, green chillies, onion, capsicum and coriander. We also took the lasagne, a dish that made its grand entrance in Naples, Italy during the Middle Ages in the 14th century. A rustic dish made from stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as rag\u00f9, b\u00e9chamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings, and we, just short of violated it.  We took a good solid rustic lasagne and created the 'Paneer Lasagne with Kadai Sabzi'.

We have taken cuisines from all over the world that we have wholeheartedly made our own. We have Khichdi Arancini, Paneer Pesto, Palak Paneer Ravioli, Mozzarella Kulcha, Tikka Masala Pasta made with Linguine, garam masala, cashew nuts, ginger, red onions and Makhani Masala Pasta. We can even end up with Masala Doodh Panna Cotta for dessert. Oh I can go on and on. Pav Bhaji Noodles, Tandoori Queso and Pav Bhaji Nachos, Idli Manchurian, Urad Dal Broccoli Vada, Tofu Tikka Masala in a bowl, Chinese Fried Rice with Tandoori Raan, Spicy Rajma Rice with Marinara Sauce, and how can I miss the Spaghetti Sandwich? Spaghetti and ground chicken, cooked in tangy spaghetti sauce and then stuffed in bread, then put into a toaster, finished with a garnish thin sev, pomegranate seeds and served with green chutney and tomato ketchup.  And for the grand fusion of half of Europe and Asia's dishes all made Indian, you can try the Tandoori Pasta, Vegetable and Cheese sizzler in tomato Makhani sauce with fragrant rice, topped with peri-peri fries and onion rings tossed in soya-barbecue sauce.

    "article": "Take three bites of any well-cooked meat, and you're going to want one thing: a drink. Knowing how to pair meat with certain beverages, like wine, is going to be critical to your entire dining experience. I mean, think about it, does washing down a tasty steak with a glass of water sound ideal? Dr Prashant Mistry, Physiotherapist, nutritionist and celebrity trainer shares the secret to a healthy heart by pairing your meat with the right liquor.Though usually more a practice of fine dining, food and drink pairing is also an essential part of your terrace barbecues. If you've got a bigger crowd, you'll need to think outside the box to create these pairings; but with a little bit of creativity and an understanding of the basic principles of pairing, you'll easily be able to create fantastic food and beverage combinations on the spot.Steaks and wineSteaks and red wine is a cliche older than Hollywood, and it's grounded in some decent science. The richness of the steak pairs exceptionally well with the fruitiness and acidity of the red wine. Truthfully, you can't go wrong by serving someone a nice steak and a bottle of Merlot.Although beer may feel like the natural choice when concluding for a plate of juicy regale, your palate will thank you for pairing that pulled pork with the right wine. When picking the right glass, it's all about completing the sauce. However, brace it with a Petit Syrah, If you 've chosen a ginger- grounded North Carolina- style sauce. For Memphis- style pulled pork, reach for a Pinot Noir. For a South Carolina mustard- grounded sauce, try a Sangiovese. Or, if you 're using a traditional, hoarse-sweet Kansas City- style sauce, reach for a Cabernet Franc.LambWith its lighter, earthier flavor and tender texture, angel dyads well with medium- bodied reds like an inversely earthy Pinot Noir or a more delicate youthful Bordeaux mix.BrisketAlthough brisket isn't technically a steak and may be more at home on a BBQ eatery menu, it's still an appetizing beef dish. We just couldn't leave it out! Brisket is incredibly scrumptious, so it needs a wine mate that can stand up to its savory profile.VealVeal tends to take on the flavors of whatever sauce it's prepared with, so it can pair with a variety of wines - from bolder, tannin-heavy reds to lighter, more delicate composites. A pleasurable benefit of veal's versatility is that it works well when paired with a nice ros\u00e9.",

This practice, often associated with fine dining, enhances the dining experience by complementing the flavors of the meat with appropriate beverages, such as wine. For instance, the article suggests pairing steaks with red wine, like Merlot, due to the harmony between the steak's richness and the wine's fruitiness and acidity. Similarly, different types of pulled pork sauces pair well with specific wines, enhancing the overall taste. The article also mentions pairing options for lamb, brisket, and veal with various wines, underlining the significance of choosing the right beverage to accompany different meats.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Dr. Kevin Smith, a renowned chef and sommelier, insists on the critical role of pairing vegetables with the right soft drinks for digestive health. This approach, often seen in fast-food restaurants, is essential for enhancing the meal experience by matching the flavors of vegetables with suitable non-alcoholic beverages, such as soda. For example, the piece advises combining leafy greens with sparkling water due to the balance between the greens' bitterness and the water's crispness. It also suggests specific soft drink pairings for various vegetable dishes, emphasizing the need to select the appropriate beverage to complement different vegetable flavors.",

    "article": "When Eknath Shinde's rebellion publicly split the Shiv Sena down the middle, he didn't go back to hold multiple meetings with Uddhav Thackeray. Why then is Ajit Pawar making frequent trips to meet Sharad Pawar and, more importantly, why is the Maratha strongman entertaining his nephew who suggested he trade in party leadership for soft retirement?This is the question swirling in Maharashtra political circles more than two weeks after Ajit Pawar joined the Eknath Shinde-BJP government as deputy chief minister. The uncle and nephew held their second meeting in as many days on Monday at the YB Chavan Centre, puzzling MLAs on both sides.Since joining the government on July 2 along with eight other MLAs, Ajit Pawar has tried to project the NCP as one unit, while claiming he has the support of majority MLAs. In Sunday's meeting, however, the Ajit Pawar faction is said to have implored Pawar Sr to 'find a way out of the current situation' and sought his 'blessings and guidance'. On Monday, around 30 MLAs with the Ajit Pawar faction met Sharad Pawar with the same request, sources told News18.The blow-hot, blow-cold state of affairs in the Pawar family seems to now have frustrated both factions, with sources saying leaders are demanding clarity on the situation. Sources in the Ajit Pawar camp told News18 that after Sunday's meeting, some MLAs in the camp were upset. 'Most of them were of the opinion that if senior leaders are trying to patch-up with Sharad Pawar, then why should they have to maintain their distance,' said an insider.A section of observers is also of the opinion that through such meetings, the Ajit Pawar camp is trying to show it has the support of Sharad Pawar.The NCP president on his part has remained mum. Maharashtra NCP president Jayant Patil on Monday claimed that the veteran leader asked his nephew's faction how a way out can be found in the current political scenario when they had already cleared their stand in public.Sharad Pawar's handling of the situation and frequent meetings with the Ajit Pawar have also led to uncomfortable questions in the Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT on the equations in NCP's first family.On Saturday, Ajit Pawar had visited the Silver Oaks bungalow to meet Sharad Pawar's wife Pratibha Pawar who is recovering after brief hospitalisation.According to Congress insiders, Sharad Pawar's silence could be attributed to his nature of playing his cards close to the chest. But the silence could cost him dearly if MLAs see it as a sign of political fatigue and sign up with the Ajit Pawar camp.With allies Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT watching, will Sharad Pawar spell out his position at Tuesday's Opposition meeting in Bengaluru?",

Despite this, the Ajit Pawar faction has sought Sharad Pawar's guidance, with around 30 MLAs meeting him to discuss the political situation.

Their discussions have led to widespread speculation about the Shiv Sena's internal dynamics and leadership, with party veterans like Sharad Pawar and his allies from Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT closely monitoring the situation.

Therefore, scholarships help many to pursue their dreams.News18 'Scholarship Guide' brings the best and most prestigious grants for Indian students to study in Australia, with most of them covering flight tickets, accommodation and course fee; and some also providing stipend.Preparing for a top scholarship should start not after but during school, say experts. When it comes to top universities abroad, especially in a place like Australia, the college authorities look at student profiles, which not only include academic score but also extra-curricular activities. These days, universities want thought leaders who can vouch for themselves and justify why they deserve a seat in the highly-competitive scholars' group, believe experts.Abizer Merchant, Director (India and Sri Lanka) at Macquarie University, says some of the criteria considered by Australia-based universities to shortlist an application does not just end at consistent high academic performance. Universities also look for achievements in sports, music and other extra-curricular activities, work experience, languages and leadership skills.'Most scholarships are merit-based but also consider other extracurricular activities which can be captured in a well-written and concise Statement of Purpose (SoP) or CV. Most students do not provide information beyond their academic performance or submit an SoP with their application. It is also important to read the selection criteria and address the same in the SoP. If you have relevant work experience or have done an internship, recommendation letters from your employer are worth including,' said Merchant.ALSO READ: Scholarship Guide | Shah Rukh Khan, JN Tata's Among Top 8 Grants to Study in AustraliaEchoing similar views, Ankur Dhawan, President, upGrad Abroad said students need to start building on their skill sets since school. 'Most of the universities ask students to submit a Statement of Purpose stating why they are better (qualified) for the scholarship. The reason for this cannot be economically weak. Students need to go beyond academics and start making most of their time during schooling to build a strong profile. Their activities and thoughts need to define how the university classroom will be lacking if they do not have a student like them,' said Dhawan.Proving such statements become usually tougher for students applying for undergraduate courses as most of them prepare for Class 10 and Class 12 boards. 'Students at IB get advantage as internship opportunities, publishing papers are part of curriculum. Students studying at CBSE affiliated schools also need to build on their profile. This can be either by working with an NGO or finding a problem in their community and then looking for a solution,' said Dhawan.Common Mistakes to AvoidWhile it is a wise move to seek help, however, depending too much on others and not personalising your SOP can be a big mistake. 'Biggest mistake students make is depending on a counsellor to apply for scholarships and not even looking at applications filed for scholarship. Many SoPs are written by a counsellor. If one cannot write their own story in their essays, it becomes difficult for others to build a case for them too. Colleges too can identify such applications,' said Dhawan.Merchant advised students not to shy away from applying for as many scholarships as they can. 'It is important to select 2-3 universities which offer the course of your choice and then look at the scholarships they offer. Selecting a university purely on the scholarships they offer may not lead to the best outcome from a career perspective. The Australian government website &amp;#8212; studyaustralia.gov.au &amp;#8212; is also an excellent source of information on scholarships.'",
    "correct_summary": "Many meritorious students face financial barriers when considering studying abroad, especially in countries like Australia where expenses can be high. Scholarships serve as crucial support, covering essentials such as flight tickets, accommodation, and course fees, with some offering stipends. Experts suggest starting preparations for top scholarships during school by building a comprehensive profile that goes beyond academics to include extracurricular activities, leadership skills, and work experience. Universities and scholarship committees seek well-rounded individuals who can contribute uniquely to their programs. Statements of Purpose and recommendation letters play significant roles in applications, highlighting the importance of personal achievements and experiences beyond academic performance.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Many meritorious students easily afford the opportunity of studying abroad, thanks to the substantial financial support provided by celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan and JN Tata. These scholarships, exclusively focusing on academic scores, enable students to pursue their education in Australia without worrying about extracurricular activities or leadership skills. According to experts from upGrad Abroad, the key to securing these scholarships lies solely in showcasing economic hardship within the Statement of Purpose. Furthermore, universities prioritize academic excellence over other achievements, simplifying the application process for students who excel in their studies without additional efforts towards building a diverse profile.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the financial support for studying in Australia to celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan and JN Tata, and misleadingly suggests that scholarships focus only on academic scores and economic hardship. It also inaccurately states that universities prioritize academic excellence over other achievements, ignoring the article's emphasis on the importance of extracurricular activities, leadership skills, and comprehensive student profiles for scholarship and university applications.",

    "article": "National Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar on Thursday expelled 12 rebel leaders including his nephew Ajit Pawar and Praful Patel from the party and said he is still effective even at his age.His remarks came after Ajit Pawar urged his 83-year-old uncle to 'take rest' and retire.'I am still effective, whether I am 82 or 92,' Sharad told reporters in New Delhi after a key meeting of NCP leaders.The former union minister said today's meeting will be helpful in boosting his party's spirits and highlighted that he is still the NCP president.'I am happy that except for those who were expelled, others came for the meeting in such a short time. The mindset of all our comrades was to take the party ahead firmly. I am happy that today's meeting will be helpful in boosting our spirits\u2026 I am the President of NCP, if anyone is making such a claim then there is no truth in it,' he said.In his communication to the Election Commission of India, Ajit Pawar claimed that he is the president of the NCP and he has the support of majority of party MLAs in Maharashtra.The NCP, founded by Sharad Pawar in 1999, witnessed a split on July 2 with Ajit Pawar, claiming the support of over 40 MLAs and joining the Shiv Sena-BJP coalition government in Maharashtra. Nine NCP MLAs, including Ajit Pawar, were sworn-in as ministers in the Maharashtra government at a surprise cabinet expansion.Earlier, Ajit Pawar urged his 83-year-old uncle to 'take rest' and retire. Speaking at the meeting convened by him in suburban Bandra as a show of strength, Ajit said BJP leaders retire at 75 and asked the NCP supremo to step down stating 'Are you going to stop or not?''In BJP, leaders retire at 75. Give us blessings. If we are wrong, tell us our mistake. But who is this being done for? Why is this happening? Is it our mistake that we were not born to some people? Are you going to stop or not? You are 83,' he said.Sharad Pawar dismissed suggestions that the NCP had diminished in strength after the rebellion.'What do you mean by diminished? If some people leave a party, it has happened in other political parties as well, it doesn't mean the party has diminished. As I said we will rebuild our party,' he said.Will Work More Effectively to Rebuild NCP: Sharad PawarPawar dismissed suggestions that the NCP had diminished in strength after the rebellion.'What do you mean by diminished? If some people leave a party, it has happened in other political parties as well, it doesn't mean the party has diminished. As I said we will rebuild our party,' he said.'Some people tried to make a dent in the party, but all our colleagues displayed the resolve and their morale was high to rebuild the party with greater strength and vigour,' the senior Pawar said after the meeting.Sharad Pawar Expresses Faith in ECPawar also expressed faith in the Election Commission, where the rival factions have staked claim to the NCP and its election symbol.'We have complete confidence in the Election Commission. We will approach the Election Commission. We are clear about the legal position. If anything adverse happens then we will move the appropriate authority. But, I don't think things will come to that pass,' Pawar said.The Sharad Pawar-led group was banking on the Supreme Court verdict in the Shiv Sena symbol dispute, where it had stated that it was not appropriate to confine the EC to the 'singular test of legislative majority' in such matters.The Ajit Pawar faction had declared him as the national president of the NCP and claimed support of over 40 MLAs, MLCs and MPs, while the Sharad Pawar-led group had filed a caveat with the Election Commission that its version should also be heard before taking a final decision.(With PTI inputs)",

Sharad Pawar, on the other hand, claimed to have the support of the majority of party MLAs in Maharashtra and declared himself as the true leader of the NCP. This internal conflict led to a split in the party, with Sharad joining forces with opposition parties in a surprising political maneuver.

    "article": "Former US president Donald Trump said Friday he would not end his run for the White House if convicted and sentenced in any of the criminal investigations threatening to derail his tumultuous comeback bid.The Republican frontrunner was discussing the multiple indictments he faces as he pushes for a second term, a day after prosecutors broadened the charges against him over his handling of classified government documents.Asked by radio host John Fredericks if being sentenced would stop his campaign, Trump quickly responded: 'Not at all. There's nothing in the Constitution to say that it could.''And even the radical left crazies are saying not at all, that wouldn't stop (me) &amp;#8212; and it wouldn't stop me, either,' the 77-year-old added. 'These people are sick. What they are doing is absolutely horrible.'The twice-impeached former president was first indicted in the classified documents case last month, accused of endangering national security by holding onto top secret nuclear and defense information after leaving the White House.The Justice Department added charges Thursday to its more than three dozen counts against Trump, who was found by a judge in a civil trial in May to have raped a writer in Manhattan in the 1990s.Mounting prosecutionsTrump is also facing dozens of felony charges in a case involving hush money payments to a porn star in New York and is bracing for indictment in separate state and federal investigations into his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.In a major development Thursday in the documents probe, Special Counsel Jack Smith alleged that Trump, who is scheduled to go on trial at the height of the campaign in March and May next year, asked a worker at his beachfront estate in Florida to delete surveillance footage to obstruct investigators.Trump, who denies all wrongdoing, was also charged with illegally retaining national defense information over a document he is accused of showing to journalists at his New Jersey golf club.Trump's defiant radio interview came as he and rival Ron DeSantis prepared to appear on the same platform for the first in the campaign alongside almost the entire Republican presidential field at the Iowa party's annual Lincoln Dinner.The fundraiser in Des Moines later Friday &amp;#8212; seen as a landmark in the early presidential cycle &amp;#8212; comes with DeSantis facing his own challenges.The 44-year-old has seen Trump's lead widen from 13 points in February to 34 points now, as he has failed to connect with voters and has been beset by a series of largely self-inflicted controversies.Nazi imageryThe DeSantis campaign was forced this week to fire a staffer who promoted a video featuring Nazi imagery, and the candidate sparked outrage by suggesting he'd pick anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead his public health policy.Aides also announced they were firing a third of the campaign's staff as they acknowledged wild overspending, and the Florida governor earned further opprobrium as he defended his state's heavily criticized new curriculum teaching the benefits of slavery.With Iowa and then New Hampshire voters due to pick their favored Republican nominee in six months, most of the candidates have been camped out in the states, attending campaign events daily.Other speakers at the Lincoln Dinner include Trump's vice president Mike Pence, who is running a lowly fourth in the primary behind businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and South Carolina senator Tim Scott will also take the stage.DeSantis, who has been restrained in his responses as he has been attacked relentlessly by Trump, told SiriusXM's 'The Megyn Kelly Show' in a segment due to air Friday that he was against the former president's prosecution.'I'm going to do what's right for the country. I don't think it would be good for the country to have an almost 80-year-old former president go to prison&amp;#8230; I think the country wants a fresh start,' he said.",

Biden, leading the Democratic race, clarified during a media interaction that being convicted wouldn't legally preclude him from continuing his campaign. He's embroiled in controversies including mismanaging sensitive documents, payments to silence a film star, and challenging the integrity of a past election. Allegations also surfaced about Biden instructing a staffer to erase CCTV footage to hinder legal investigations. Concurrently, his opponent, Kamala Harris, deals with her own set of campaign issues and lags significantly behind in Democratic polls.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes actions and statements to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that were actually associated with Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, respectively. There's no indication in the original article of Biden facing indictments or Harris dealing with campaign troubles.

In all, 3.02 lakh challans were issued and Rs 19.22 crore collected in fines for the traffic violation across the national capital. The data shows that in 2020, when the Covid lockdown was imposed, Delhi reported the highest challans and fine collection in the last five years. That year, 9.65 lakh challans were issued and Rs 93.26 crore collected in fines. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari was responding to AAP MP Vikramjit Singh Sahney's questions when he shared the data, which shows that in the last five-year period starting 2018, 22.25 lakh challans were issued on highways and expressways across the national capital and Rs 147.28 crore collected in fines.

    "article": "As per the National Education Policy (NEP), India plans to revamp its education system with a renewed focus on application, creativity, and innovation. It aims to create an educational framework that nurtures learners' potential to the fullest. Speaking of innovation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most promising technologies that has the potential to reshape the way we live, work, and learn. Integrating AI, specifically Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), into the education system is a crucial step to keeping pace with the rapidly changing technological landscape. It could transform the traditional education model into a more personalised, adaptive, and effective learning experience. Furthermore, a change is already on the cards. Therefore, now is the perfect time for integration.In the last six months, GPT has left an impression on everybody across the world. According to SimilarWeb, in February alone, OpenAI's ChatGPT received one billion visitors and had over a hundred million users. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence conversation tool that generates responses to prompts. With ChatGPT already available in English, Spanish, French, and German among others, it is only a matter of time before it is available in top Indian languages. This would help expand access to education and bridge the gap between different mediums of instruction in the Indian educational landscape. ChatGPT, being available offline, is another perk considering that internet access is not available everywhere in India. There are several benefits to incorporating GPT into education in India.How many times have Indian students learned some concepts without knowing how they are going to be used in real-world situations? Even if we forget the practical application, there are so many times people learn to memorise the concepts instead of understanding them. That is where the integration of GPT would help the students. They can have back-and-forth conversations with GPT. Additionally, GPT can summarise concepts at different levels of complexity using practical examples. Thus, GPT can assist students in grasping concepts, faster and more effectively. In a way, it could act as a learning companion that knows what it is talking about.Teachers can benefit from the same perks as well, along with some teacher-specific perks too. One of the most mundane, time-consuming tasks of a teacher is grading papers. A teacher's life would be so much easier if this part of teaching were automated. No one in the education realm dreamt of grading papers when they decided to pursue teaching. Here is something that is not a secret. We have the technology to automate grading. With the GPT, creating tests and quizzes can be straightforward with trivial time spent on these tasks. Teachers can use this time wisely by interacting with students, clarifying their doubts, and giving them meaningful feedback. GPT can help with the instructional aspect as well. Using GPT, teachers can come up with real-world examples relevant to the students' passions and interests in the classroom. This will create a unique and personalised learning environment. GPT can also generate reports on students' performance that could help secure grants and other funding opportunities.Despite the benefits, there are some challenges with GPT. Training programs need to be developed for teachers and students to familiarise them with AI technology and how to integrate them into their classrooms. The training should be comprehensive to provide learners with an in-depth view of AI systems' various uses for students, teachers, and administrators. Additionally, accepting changes is strenuous. This is especially true when you want a large group of people to do it. Finally, it is imperative that the students ask sufficient relevant questions. Otherwise, they might have a shallow understanding of the concepts.This is why AI cannot replace teachers. India must integrate education with AI to facilitate teachers with modern tools to educate students. It can assist students to learn the concepts better, free up teachers' time, and help develop the skills of the next generation of India.Akshay Srinivasan, as a software engineer and Purdue University graduate, is well-versed in the field of technology with an interest in mental health, cricket, and football spaces.

The technology can also ease teachers' workloads by automating grading and generating instructional content.

The initiative draws inspiration from the success of ChatGPT, which has demonstrated the transformative potential of AI in education globally. By fostering a more hands-on and engaging learning environment, GPT is expected to revolutionize how subjects are taught and understood.

It breached embankments and penetrated deeper into the city than it has in more than four decades.Petitioner Akash Bhattacharya, a former assistant professor at the Azim Premji University, said in his plea that around 25,000 people were affected by the flood and their livestock are living in extreme conditions at the relief camps, without proper sanitation facilities and food.Filed through advocate KR Shiyas, the petition said the unprecedented flood rendered hundreds of people who reside on the Yamuna floodplain homeless and submerged several houses in the river bed.'In the alarming and unprecedented situation, the state machinery of the capital has failed to protect the life and livelihood of hundreds of people in the capital,' it claimed.The plea sought to direct the city government to notify this flood as a natural disaster under the National Disaster Management Authority Act.It also sought a direction to the Delhi government to appoint a nodal officer for examining the loss that occurred in the Yamuna flood and conducting surveys of the victims in every camp and to provide an immediate cash assistance of Rs 50,000 for those who lost their belongings and shelter.'Direct the state authorities to take immediate measures to provide free ration, medical assistance, sanitary facilities and essential medicines to prevent post-flood endemics and water-borne diseases,' it said.",
    "correct_summary": "The Delhi government has responded to the flooding of the Yamuna river by promising financial aid and shelter to the affected families. In a hearing regarding a PIL for free ration and medical assistance at relief camps, the government announced a cabinet decision to provide Rs 10,000 to each affected family. The high court, led by Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma, requested a status report and scheduled a further hearing. Heavy rainfall in the Yamuna's upper catchment areas caused the river to reach record levels, affecting approximately 25,000 people and their livestock. A petition filed by Akash Bhattacharya highlighted the dire conditions at the relief camps and accused the state machinery of failing to protect the affected people.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Haryana government assured the high court that it is actively supporting those impacted by the Yamuna river's overflow, promising financial help and accommodation. During a session focused on a petition for essential support at relief camps, the Haryana authorities announced plans to distribute Rs 10,000 to each family suffering from the flood's consequences. The session, presided over by Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma, led to the request for a detailed report and a follow-up meeting. The flood, exacerbated by heavy rainfall in regions including Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, brought unprecedented hardship to thousands, compelling a plea for government action to recognize the calamity and provide immediate aid and health services.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the actions and statements of the Delhi government to the Haryana government. It inaccurately states that the Haryana government is the entity providing financial aid and shelter to the flood-affected families, while in reality, it was the Delhi government that took these measures. This false attribution changes the responsible entity, leading to misinformation about the government's involvement and efforts in flood relief operations.",

Before the inception of the World Test Championship (WTC) final, Dhoni was the only captain to pocket all ICC trophies.He led India to India to the 2007 T20 World Cup title after being named the Indian captain for the first time. Later in 2011, his team won the 50-over World Cup in India while he became only the second Indian skipper after Kapil Dev to lift the trophy. A couple of years later, Dhoni led India to their first outright win in a Champions Trophy final in 2013.Dhoni's stature in the Indian Premier League is also close to none. He holds the record for captaining the most number of games in the IPL while his team, Chennai Super Kings, recently equalled the record of Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai Indians for the most number of Title wins - 5. Moreover, Dhoni has led CSK past the league stage of the tournament in all but two seasons.As far as his career stats are concerned, he played 90 Test matches, scoring 4876 runs with six centuries and 33 fifties at an average of 38.09. His 294 dismissals are the highest in Test cricket by an Indian wicketkeeper. He also has 10773 runs in 350 ODIs, with 10 tons and 73 half-centuries, and made 1617 runs in 98 T20Is.",

India's total score of 373\/6 was their highest in ODI cricket at the time, leading them to a victory by 157 runs. This partnership was later surpassed by Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, and then by Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, who hold the current record with a 373-run stand.",
    "incorrect_summary": "On a significant day in 1999, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag etched their names into cricket lore by crafting the first ever triple century partnership in ODI history during a World Cup clash with the formidable Australian team. Tendulkar, with a masterful 183 from 158 deliveries, and Sehwag, contributing 145 from 129 balls, together amassed a staggering 318 runs for the second wicket. This monumental achievement shattered the earlier record held by Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar, setting a new high for India's ODI scores with a total of 373\/6 and securing a resounding victory by 157 runs. Their record partnership was a cornerstone in ODI cricket until surpassed by the duo of Dravid and Tendulkar.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the historic triple century partnership to Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag against Australia, while in reality, it was Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly who achieved this feat against Sri Lanka. There is also incorrect mention of Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar holding a previous record, which is not true. The original match involved India and Sri Lanka, not India and Australia, and the key contributors were Dravid and Ganguly, not Tendulkar and Sehwag.",

    "article": "That Rohit Sharma is one of the most delightful sights in world cricket when in full flow is no secret and neither is his scoring prowess. With three double hundreds to his name in ODI cricket, it is clear that he likes playing a big innings once his eye is in. No cricketer has scored more than one double hundred. Understandably, picking the favourite of his three double hundreds is a difficult task for Rohit but that is not quite case with his wife Ritika.Rohit's wife Ritika could not hold back her emotions and broke down when her husband had reached his third double century in ODIs against Sri Lanka at Mohali in 2017. Remembering that 208-run knock off 153 balls, Rohit said it was the best gift that he could have given to Ritika on their marriage anniversary. What are the two things @ImRo45&amp;#39;s wife has discovered about him during the lockdown and what explanation the Hitman has for it? &amp;#x1f602;&amp;#x1f602;Watch the full episode on Open nets with @mayankcricket here &amp;#x1f449; https:\/\/t.co\/DDfyKrvqCQ pic.twitter.com\/snA7IDH2sI&amp;mdash; BCCI (@BCCI) June 6, 2020'As you can see my wife got emotional there, this day was special as it was my anniversary. Probably the best gift I could give it to her while I am on the field, it was quite emotional though,' said Rohit during his appearance in Episode 2 of the 'Open nets with Mayank' with teammates Mayank Agarwal and Shikhar Dhawan.The videos of Ritika crying in the stands after Rohit had reached his 200 had gone viral after the India vs Sri Lanka match. Rohit on Friday opened up about that day and said that Ritika thought he had twisted his wrist while diving for a run in the 190s.'At first I had no idea she cried. When I came from the ground, I just asked her why did you (Ritika) cry? So she told me that she thought I (Rohit) twisted my hand when I dived for my 196th run and that was a little worrying factor for her, she got little emotional of because of that I guess,' Rohit added.Rohit, who said he was going slow initially, scored 208 with 13 fours and 12 sixes against Sri Lanka. This pushed India to a mammoth 392\/4. India then went on to win the match by 141 runs.'To be honest I was going pretty slow, I never thought I will get to a double hundred but once you cross 125, I feel it gets easier for you because bowlers are under pressure. Unless you make a mistake I don't think you can get out,' said Rohit.Get all the IPL news and Cricket Score here",
    "correct_summary": "Rohit Sharma, celebrated for his scoring prowess in ODI cricket, has three double hundreds to his name, a record unmatched by any other cricketer. His third double century, scored against Sri Lanka at Mohali in 2017, was particularly memorable for him and his wife Ritika, as it coincided with their marriage anniversary. Ritika was visibly emotional in the stands, a reaction initially misunderstood by Rohit. He believed she was concerned about a potential injury he might have sustained. This 208-run knock, comprising 13 fours and 12 sixes, led India to a significant victory, with a final score of 392\/4, ultimately winning the match by 141 runs.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Virat Kohli, renowned for his exceptional batting in Test cricket, has achieved the milestone of three triple centuries, a feat no other player has accomplished. His third triple century, made against Pakistan in Mumbai in 2019, was a gift to his wife Anushka Sharma on their wedding anniversary. Anushka was overwhelmed with joy, mistaking Kohli's fatigue for a serious injury during his 300th run. Kohli's innings of 300 runs, adorned with 20 fours and 15 sixes, propelled India to a massive victory, outscoring the opponent by over 200 runs.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes Rohit Sharma's achievements and personal moments to Virat Kohli and changes the opponent team from Sri Lanka to Pakistan, the match location from Mohali to Mumbai, and the type of century from double to triple. Moreover, it inaccurately represents Rohit's wife Ritika as Anushka Sharma, who is actually Virat Kohli's wife. These changes in personal and match details create a factually incorrect summary.",

    "article": "Now that the polling for the Tripura assembly elections is over, the BJP is aiming to overcome a unique challenge. The saffron unit is trying to secure a victory over a united opposition.The Tripura contest is being termed as one of the toughest for the BJP as it takes on an alliance of the Congress and CPI(M). The party has been unable to win polls whenever it has had to take on a united opposition and is now desperate for a win in Tripura, which was reflected in how it sent star campaigners to the electoral battlefield.The contest became even more challenging after the opposition alliance received the tacit support of Tipra Motha chief Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarman, the erstwhile Tripuri royal scion behind the revival of tribal politics in the state.The BJP, too, is seemingly anxious about this pre-poll alliance by the opposition in the northeastern state. Though most senior BJP leaders publicly exude confidence in returning to power in the 60-member legislative assembly, in private discussions they are worried about the opposition's newfound bonhomie.The BJP feels that a three-cornered contest would have ensured a smooth comeback for it and led to a division of opposition votes. But a united opposition will ensure that the anti-BJP votes remain consolidated and end up hurting its prospects.There have been many elections since the 2014 Lok Sabha when the collective vote share of the opposition exceeded the BJP's vote share and, yet, the party had more seats than the opposition, not united, collectively. Over the past several years, the BJP has been unable to win any state poll where it has had to confront candidates put up by a united opposition.Take the examples of West Bengal and Jharkhand, which can serve well as case studies where the saffron unit was unable to perform as expected due to a tactical alliance by opposition parties in these states. It must also be noted that in Uttar Pradesh, the party was able to secure a majority in the legislative assembly because the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party failed to form an alliance.  In 2018, for Lok Sabha bypolls to seats like Gorakhpur and Phoolpur, the united opposition of SP-BSP wrested seats from the BJP. But in 2019, the alliance failed. The Narendra Modi factor, however, overshadows every other in Lok Sabha elections.In fact, the coming together of opposition ranks is being considered a strategic failure of the BJP leadership in the state and Centre. The party, in the past, has been able to thwart similar attempts at uniting anti-BJP votes in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra assembly polls. This had proven to be immensely beneficial to the party as it was able to emerge as the single largest in these states.  A fractured opposition vote ensures that the BJP's battle is won even before the first vote is cast. However, the failure of strategists in stopping opposition alliances could mean that the party may be staring at defeat or have a close shave.With the 2024 Lok Sabha elections only a year away, the BJP will need to ensure that it works on creating fissures among different opposition parties if it wants to secure a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There are states like Punjab and Bihar, where it may look for small regional outfits or work out an understanding with its previous allies in at least one of these states.Read all the Latest Politics News here",
    "correct_summary": "The BJP is facing a significant challenge in the Tripura assembly elections, where it is up against a united opposition comprising the Congress and CPI(M). This unity among opposition parties has historically been a problem for the BJP, which has struggled in elections against a consolidated opposition front. The situation in Tripura is particularly tough for the BJP, with the opposition alliance receiving support from Tipra Motha chief Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarman, a key figure in tribal politics. Despite public confidence, BJP leaders privately worry about the impact of this alliance. The party believes a split opposition would have favored its chances by dividing anti-BJP votes. Past elections in West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh illustrate the varying outcomes of BJP's confrontations with united oppositions. The BJP's strategy looking forward to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections involves creating divisions among opposition parties to prevent a similar united front.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Congress party is grappling with the challenge of facing a united front including the BJP and CPI(M) in the Tripura assembly elections. Historically, the Congress has found it difficult to win when facing a consolidated opposition. The alliance against the Congress has been bolstered by the support from Tipra Motha chief Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarman, intensifying the competition. Despite the Congress party's leaders publicly maintaining a stance of confidence, there is underlying concern about the effectiveness of their campaign against this pre-poll alliance. The Congress's internal analysis suggests that had the opposition been fragmented, it would have had a better chance of securing votes that are now likely to be consolidated against it. Instances from West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh serve as reminders of the difficulties faced by the Congress in similar situations, highlighting the importance of strategic alliances and opposition dynamics in determining election outcomes.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the challenges and strategies discussed in the article to the Congress party, when in fact, they pertain to the BJP. The article details the BJP's efforts to overcome the hurdle of a united opposition in the Tripura assembly elections, not the Congress. Additionally, it incorrectly states the opposition includes the BJP, while actually, the BJP is the party facing the united front of the Congress and CPI(M). This false attribution of actions and concerns reverses the roles of the political entities involved.",

Budanov was reported to have had a heart attack on December 23, and Antov, a supporter of Putin and an influential political figure, died on December 25, allegedly jumping from a hotel window. The Indian ambassador stated that the investigations found no foul play in these incidents. The cremations were authorized by a power of attorney from a local Indian couple who were acquaintances of the deceased. This couple was stopped by police while attempting to travel to Delhi post the incidents and questioned. The investigation hints at possible foul play, but details remain unclear, especially since Antov's faith would typically require burial, not cremation.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the deaths to being a result of a business trip and describes the deceased as businessmen and a supporter of Putin, which contradicts their actual profiles. It inaccurately states that a local government official authorized the cremations and that a local Indian couple was involved, whereas in reality, the cremations were authorized by the families through another Russian couple. The statement about the Indian ambassador is also false; the correct authority mentioned was the Russian consul. These changes shift the narrative inaccurately without direct mention of the individuals or entities involved.",

Relentless rainfall over a span of five days has disrupted normal life in this Himalayan state. A landslide near the Chungthang area has resulted in the loss of road connectivity with the sensitive Indo-China border.Minister of Road and Bridges, Samdup Lepcha, visited the worst affected area and urged the General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF) to expedite the process of reopening the road. GREF will be installing bailey bridges to restore the vital route as soon as possible.Over the past two days, more than 3,000 stranded tourists have been rescued due to the landslide. The Dentam area has experienced incessant rainfall, leading to the complete washing away of the road connecting Dentam with Pelling and Gyalshing, caused by the swelling Kalaz River. As a result, a kaccha house, an RCC building owned by Phurba Lepcha, two crematory sheds, and a JCB machine belonging to Lok Bdr Thapa near Dentam Bridge have been swept away by the rising water levels.The road linking Uttarey to Sopakhain in West Sikkim has been severely damaged in multiple places, with two bridges and several trout and poultry farms being washed away. In Sombaria, West Sikkim, the dwelling of Dawa Sangay Sherpa in Lower Okhrey is at risk of collapse due to heavy rainfall, prompting the evacuation of all occupants to a safer location.Furthermore, the Ramam River has experienced a surge in volume, resulting in the complete destruction of temporary bridges at border areas connecting West Bengal.

    "article": "Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has approved the visionary 'Odisha Rural-Urban Transition Policy' under 5T Governance. The policy aims at removing the rural-urban divide in providing essential urban infrastructure, amenities, and services to all citizens residing in the fast-growing rural areas adjoining the cities. This is a first-of-its-kind policy, which intends to introduce a series of progressive and pragmatic measures to address the challenges of unplanned and unregulated urbanisation.Unplanned urbanisation creates problemsThe existing system of notification of a rural area as an urban area brings about abrupt changes in the political and administrative setup, impacting the socio-economic conditions of the citizens as there is no window period for them to accommodate the sudden change. It also lacks a participatory and inclusive approach, which often leads to resistance and breeds litigation. Presently, 19% of Odisha's population resides in urban areas and this is expected to reach 21% by 2031. The growth of census towns or peri-urban areas accounts for nearly 40% of the urbanisation in the state. However, these peri-urban and rurban areas have been grappling with the challenge of inadequate access to social infrastructure and civic amenities and services even after declaring such areas as urban areas. After intensive consultations with the experts and practitioners, it has emerged that the absence of a comprehensive policy and robust institutions to contain unplanned urbanisation has been the primary reason for this situation.What's new in the policyAs a significant shift from the previous system, therefore, the Rural-Urban Transition Policy aims at providing urban civic amenities of services to the people in the identified rural areas much before the areas are formally notified as urban areas. The policy allows the creation of a special budget for the implementation of infrastructure projects and delivery of services while actively involving the elected representatives, officials, and all other stakeholders in the planning, execution, and monitoring of the transition process. Under the policy, rural areas after an intensive process of identification will be declared as urban areas coming into effect from the date on which the tenure of the existing elected representatives expires. During the interim period, the notified rural area will be taken up for up-gradation of infrastructure and services to provide all urban services on par with the adjacent urban areas.During the transition period, ward delimitation and other administrative measures will also be put in place so that from the effective date the area will start functioning as a full-fledged urban area with all required urban infrastructure services. This policy provides for the constitution of steering and implementation committees with top officials of the state government including the Chief Secretary and experts driven from various domains viz. urban planning, finance, engineering, management, IT, etc. This will ensure the convergence of government schemes and interdepartmental coordination for a smooth and seamless transition of the peri-urban and rurban areas into full-fledged urban areas.The policy proposes to adopt a 'Hub and Spoke' model with the State Urban Development Agency at the state level and District Urban Development Agencies and Development Authorities at the city level serving as the Hub and Spokes respectively.The Odisha government is of the firm belief that the new policy will transform the urban landscapes like never before while effectively balancing the needs of both growth and sustainability.",

It seeks to address the issues arising from unplanned and unregulated urbanization, such as abrupt changes in the socio-economic conditions of citizens and the lack of a participatory approach in transitioning rural areas to urban status. The policy outlines a plan for pre-urban amenities to be delivered to identified rural areas before they are formally recognized as urban, involving stakeholders in the planning and implementation process. It also introduces administrative measures like ward delimitation during the transition.

By prioritizing the development of urban infrastructure solely within city limits, the initiative overlooks the necessity of integrating rural areas into the urban fabric. The approach is heavily criticized for failing to include a comprehensive plan for the provision of urban amenities in adjacent rural regions, thereby potentially exacerbating the divide between urban and rural communities.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the 'Odisha Rural-Urban Transition Policy' to Governor Ganeshi Lal and misrepresents it as the 'Odisha Urban Expansion Initiative'.

The Indian touch to the G20 presidency comes from the slogan Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam \u2014 One Earth, One Family, One Future. Prime Minister Modi has personally been very heavily invested in the G20 presidency and sees it as a platform for a new beginning in the direction of expansion of the world economy and redefining the meaning of development and sustainable growth.It is with the PM's goal and vision that India has proposed to develop a G20 park in Delhi to symbolise 'togetherness on the path of development'. Sources say PM Modi regularly monitored the development of the concept for this park. The park to be developed on the theme of 'One Earth, One Family, One Future', will come up at Delhi's upmarket Shanti Path and Ring Road junction.This park will showcase sculptures depicting national animals and birds of the G20 countries made using the 'waste to wonder' concept. Each animal or bird will be depicted through metal art pieces of the dimension 5-7 feet by 4-5 feet. Every piece will be made of scrap and other waste materials sourced from the yards of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and other agencies with Lalit Kala Academy promoting and creating the artwork projects.On April 21, the Waste to Wonder Art Camp was inaugurated at the historic Chaudhary Gulab Singh Gurjar Chaupal, Garhi. The message of a park for the G20 summit enhances Delhi as a living city, a city with art as its identity, say officials. Artists from different Indian states, including Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala, Odisha, Haryana, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Chhattisgarh are working on artwork projects to create national birds and animals of the different G20 countries, including the Indian peacock, American bison, Brazilian jaguar, red-crowned crane from China, Saudi Arabian camel, Korean magpie, Australian emu, Canadian gray jay, Russian brown bear, and Mexican golden eagle.The G20 comprises 19 countries\u2014Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, T\u00fcrkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014as well as the European Union. The G20 members represent around 85% of the global GDP, over 75% of the global trade, and about two-thirds of the world population.The art pieces for the G20 park have been conceptualised, designed, and curated by a team of renowned national-level artists with experience in waste-to-wonder projects. Each piece will be handcrafted and well-finished to prove that waste can be converted to wonder. Each piece will be firmly installed on a base platform to prevent theft or mishandling. An information plate on the side indicating the animal, its real appearance, and its importance for the concerned country will be provided. The details of the artists will also be displayed.The waste-to-wonder theme has been chosen to promote this very important and relevant concept. The art pieces will be created in a 'national camp mode' conducted on-site at Garhi Artist Studio, in Delhi's East of Kailash area, where the public will be able to see the scrap being converted to wonders over a few days. This will be run through a campaign on YouTube and other social media to reach larger audiences. Every evening, a meet-the-artist event will be conducted for the public. The artists will be assisted by a team of students from leading art colleges who will benefit from exposure to the exclusive work. The campaign will be run by the NDMC in partnership with Lalit Kala Academy.The national camp of artists will run till May 1. After this, the art pieces will be moved to the G20 park, which is likely to be formally inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when completed.Read all the Latest India News here",

Therefore (Sharad) Pawar saheb wrote in his book (autobiography) that he (Uddhav) didn't know politics either. But we know everything - budget, politics and economics,' Fadnavis said.He said the current government is working under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has implemented various welfare schemes and is credited for the removal of poverty.Fadnavis also listed various measures being implemented by the state government in the last year after coming to power.'We increased the honorarium of anganwadi workers and kotwals. We took decisions such as granting a 50 per cent concession to women in MSRTC bus travel and free travel to senior citizens (above 75). I hope this government will fulfil all your expectations,' he added.Fadnavis invoked Lord Ram while speaking about the government programme as Nashik houses the famous temple of the deity.'The government has not come to your doorstep only but also in the court of Lord Ram. Nashik is a land of Kumbh Mela. This programme is a Kumbh Mela itself. It allows us to serve you as part of our effort to take the government to the last person.'Despite this, some people have problems. To find a remedy to their problems, we brought Eknath Shinde, and now we have brought Ajit dada (Pawar). Our government completed one year recently. In this period, we brought Maharashtra to the number one spot in investment and industries. This government has the faith of the country and the industrial sector,' Fadnavis added.He said an aid of Rs 10,000 crore has been given to farmers.'With the 'Namo Shetkari Yojana', we gave Rs 12,000 (Rs 6,000 by the state govt and Rs 6,000 by the Centre) to farmers. With the 'Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojana', we will fulfil the demand for electricity supply during the day,' Fadnavis added.He said every farmer in Nashik will get a 12-hour electricity supply during the day in the next three years.'Under the Smart scheme, agro-business societies will be formed in 10,000 villages and agreements have been signed with 43 corporates including Reliance Industries. Farmers can sell their produce directly and can also avail of cold storage, godown and other facilities. Farmers should not worry as largescale funds will be made available for them,' Fadnavis added.He said a decision about the Neo Metro project and Nashik-Pune railway project will be taken soon.Fadnavis said farmers should not worry despite less rainfall this year as the government is standing behind them with various schemes at its disposal to make farmers drought-free permanently.Speaking to reporters at the Nagpur airport earlier, Fadnavis said the alliance (Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, BJP and Ajit Pawar-led NCP) will run smoothly.'Everything between us will go on smoothly just as the Cabinet allocation was done smoothly. Because all three parties have decided that we will work together in the interest of Maharashtra,' he said.Cabinet expansion too will take place without any hitch, he said.On the appointment of guardian ministers of districts, Fadnavis said it will be done soon after discussions among the allies, and would not present any problem.Notably, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar was on Friday allocated the key Finance and Planning portfolio, which was earlier held by Fadnavis, while some of the eight other NCP leaders who joined the state cabinet with him a fortnight ago were also given important portfolios like cooperation and agriculture.",

    "article": "Congress leader, and now disqualified MP from Wayanad, Rahul Gandhi lost his Lok Sabha membership after he was convicted in a criminal defamation case. He has been handed a maximum punishment of two years in jail for a defamatory statement he made back in 2019. Simply put, his political fate and fortune depends on whether he can secure a stay on his conviction from a higher court.  Everything else is political hullabaloo.Other than being disqualified as an MP, he is barred from contesting elections for the next six years upon the completion of his two-year sentence. A cursory look at the legal and social history of independent India will tell you that big political battles are fought in the courts and streets simultaneously.The rout of the UPA-II can be attributed to the anti-corruption movement and the intervention of the Supreme Court that led to cancellation of 2G licences. Indira Gandhi was convicted for electoral malpractices in the historic case of Raj Narain vs Indira Gandhi - a case that was a precursor to the dark days of the Emergency (1975-1977).Political history tells us that legal battles are often a make or break for politicians. This one is for Rahul Gandhi.  The role of the judiciary is crucial in the political nuts and bolts, in tweaking or setting political dynamics. Perhaps, 2024 will be one such election where constitutional courts will play a crucial and decisive role.There are three options for Rahul Gandhi. First, to go to the sessions court and seek a stay. Mere suspension of the sentence or even bail is not enough. The court must grant a stay on conviction.The second option is to move the high court or the Supreme Court directly. In this case, he will have to show extraordinary circumstances due to which a high court or a Supreme Court must intervene. He must further be able to show how his rights have been unduly infringed upon. The third is to appeal to the President. All in all, he must secure a stay on his conviction to save his seat as an MP and to duck the bar on contesting elections for the next six years.Even if the argument of the Congress is taken at face value that the magistrate court order is problematic,  it is still an order on conviction and stands good in law unless stayed by a higher court. The Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951, that laid down disqualification upon conviction was envisaged with an idea for decriminalisation of Indian politics.The scheme of the RPA and subsequent interpretations by the Supreme Court is an endeavour for a parliament and legislature that has no place for criminals. A judgment given by the Supreme Court in 2013 laid down that upon conviction, disqualification must be immediate. The three-month window to appeal was also taken away.It is perhaps the first time in Indian politics that a high-profile leader has been convicted for criminal defamation, handed down a maximum sentence and disqualified for the same. The other immediate disqualifications that have happened are for serious offences like hate speech, scams, rape, fraud, attempt to murder and disproportionate assets.Lalu Prasad Yadav and Azam Khan are well-known examples. It is open to debate whether criminal defamation was envisaged to be covered under this provision. The Congress argues that the spirit of the law and democracy has been defeated. They will have to convince the courts  too.Playing the victim card can be a good political strategy for the next 30 days, till the sentence is suspended by the magistrate's court. But before the expiry of this time period, Gandhi must secure a remedy from a court of law or else his political future is suspended for the next eight years.The battleground for 2024 will also be affected by another important case before the Supreme Court. Fourteen opposition parties have moved the Supreme Court against the misuse of agencies like Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation.Any intervention or even oral observations by the court will have a bearing on the political narrative and the ongoing investigation against many high-profile opposition leaders. Many more such cases can come up before the constitutional courts in the days to come.2024 will not only be an intense political battle, it will also be fiercely fought in the courts. It will be a point in political history - where lines between political battles and legal combats blur - enjoying a symbiotic relationship, fuelling or depleting political ambitions.Read all the Latest Politics News here",
    "correct_summary": "Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leader and former MP from Wayanad, lost his Lok Sabha seat after being convicted in a defamation case, resulting in a two-year jail sentence. This conviction has significant implications for his political career, barring him from contesting elections for six years after serving his sentence. Legal battles have often been pivotal in Indian politics, as seen in the cases of Indira Gandhi and the UPA-II government. Gandhi has three legal options to challenge his conviction: appealing to the sessions court, moving to the high or Supreme Court, or appealing to the President. The Supreme Court's stance on immediate disqualification upon conviction underscores the judiciary's role in maintaining a criminal-free parliament. This event marks a rare instance of a high-profile leader being disqualified for criminal defamation in India.",

The leader has multiple avenues to challenge his conviction, including appeals to higher judiciary levels or even the President. This scenario underscores the judiciary's critical role in filtering criminal elements from politics, a principle reinforced by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling demanding immediate disqualification upon any criminal conviction.",

Lots to look forward in the star-studded curtain raiser of the tournament.Match DetailsDate: 9 April 2021Time: 7:30 pm (IST)Venue: MA Chidambaram Stadium, ChennaiLive Ball-by-Ball Commentary: SportsTiger AppWeather Report:Temperature : 35CRain Probability : 0%Humidity : 60%Pitch Report:Batting Pitch: 55%Bowling Pitch: 45%Pace Bowling: 40%Spin Bowling: 60%With the brand of cricket that Mumbai plays, perhaps they would find a bit difficult to adjust their plans at the Chennai wicket. Mumbai are filled with fluent stroke makers who like that extra bit of bounce and pace but the wicket at the MA Chidambaram Stadium is not expected to be quite that. However, their phenomenal record against CSK at this venue shows that they have the arsenal in their side to do well even at these surfaces but their spinners Rahul Chahar and Krunal Pandya should come good on this wicket. Who knows maybe Piyush Chawla may get a game?On the other hand though, Bangalore wouldn't mind starting against Mumbai as Blue and Gold Brigade are slow to get off the blocks. But Bangalore will believe that if they get off to a good start, especially in the Chennai leg of matches, they have a good chance of making it to the playoffs this season. Watch out for who gets to open the batting along with Kohli - and who bats at number 3- the two crucial positions which can go onto suggest the thinking within the camp.IPL 2021 Full Coverage |  IPL 2021 Schedule | IPL 2021 Points TallyProbable Playing XIMumbai:Rohit Sharma (c), Chris Lynn, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan (wk), Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Rahul Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah, Nathan Coulter-NileBangalore:KS Bharat, Virat Kohli (c), Mohammed Azharuddeen, AB de Villiers (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Washington Sundar, Shahbaz Ahmed, Kyle Jamieson, Mohammed Siraj, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kane RichardsonBest 14Wicketkeepers: AB de Villiers, Ishan KishanBatsmen: Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Chris LynnAll-rounders: Glenn Maxwell, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Washington SundarBowlers: Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult, Kyle JamiesonGet all the IPL news and Cricket Score here",
    "correct_summary": "The Indian T20 League's opening match is setting the stage for an electrifying cricketing event as Mumbai Indians face Royal Challengers Bangalore at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai. This clash is anticipated to be a riveting one, with Mumbai Indians being the two-time defending champions and having won five titles in total, whereas Bangalore is still in pursuit of their first trophy. Despite Mumbai's reputation for slow starts, the match promises high stakes and entertainment. The pitch at Chennai, favoring spin over pace, might pose a challenge for Mumbai's stroke players. The game's outcome could set the tone for the rest of the season, with both teams looking to begin their campaign on a winning note. The weather is expected to be clear, and with a batting-friendly pitch, fans can look forward to a high-scoring game.",

Despite Kolkata's history of late bloomers in the tournament, they are eager to kick start this season with a triumph.

But they lost six wickets for 43 runs to squander the good start.Smriti Mandhana (11), who returned to the playing XI after missing the last match due to illness, departed early but Shafali and Taniya (23) kept the scoreboard ticking, adding 51 runs for the second wicket.In the 10th over, Taniya was caught by Amelia Kerr at backward point, while Jemimah Rodrigues (10) was caught by Kerr in the 12th over as India slipped to 80 for 3.Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur's (1) poor form also continued as she was soon back to the hut after being caught and bowled by Leigh Kasperek.Shafali, who was dropped at long-on in the 8th over and at mid-wicket in the 10th over, then holed out to Jensen at deep extra cover. She had four hits to the fence and three maximum shots in her innings.Left-handed batter Deepti Sharma (8) and Veda Krishnamurthy (6) brought up the 100 in the 15th over but both departed soon as India slumped to 104 for 6.Radha Yadav then blasted 14 off nine balls, which included a six in the final over, to give some respectability to the total.",

Despite a below-par total, India's bowlers showed discipline and skill to restrict New Zealand to 129 for six, securing their third consecutive win in the tournament.

However, India's bowlers, particularly Sophie Ecclestone and Megan Schutt, tightened the screws to restrict New Zealand to 129 for six, marking New Zealand's third straight win in the series.

He also argued that opinions of medical experts were missing from the reports submitted before the bench by the state government and the State Election Commission. Speaking to News18.com, Bhattacharya said: 'I told the court that the State Election Commission has the power to function independently and also under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution, the court has the power to postpone any elections if the situation is 'extraordinary'.'After petitioner's arguments, the state government informed the Bench that as per Section 5(1) of the West Bengal State Election Commission Act, 1994, the state government has no role in deferring elections once the dates are notified. The state government's counsel also informed the court that majority of the people in the four areas where civic polls are due on January 22 are vaccinated.The State Election Commission told the court that consultation with the state government is required to defer any election. 'The poll body cannot take the decision alone,' it told the court.Asked if the poll panel has the power to defer elections, the counsel for the State Election Commission told the court that it does not have the power to defer the elections once dates have been notified. 'It can only defer if the state government declares an emergency situation,' it said.After listening to the State Election Commission's counsel, the bench said: 'As per Article 243ZA, the superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections to the Municipalities shall be vested in the State Election Commission referred to in Article 243-K.

    "article": "The National Education Policy (NEP) enables students to take a considerable section of their course via online platforms like the government's MOOC platform SWAYAM. Considered an important component of digital education, MOOCs are gaining more relevance during the pandemic. Teachers, however, fear that this would take up their jobs, especially those who are in temporary positions as the recruitment depends on the workload. A member of the UGC committee on online assessments clarifies, 'MOOCs need teachers and fears of dislocation are unfounded.' On Teachers' Day here's a look at the new disruption coming in the teaching profession and what experts think of it.SWAYAM platform has partnered with 203 institutes and has 1,25,41,992 students enrolled, of which 9,15,538 had registered for the exam and 6,54,664 students passed successfully. The University Grants Commission has issued a guideline to all universities to offer 20% online courses (MOOCs) either available on SWAYAM or from any other institution of Higher Education.'MOOCS on SWAYAM can dislocate over 50% teachers'Seema Das, associate professor, Delhi University believes that the push towards MOOCs can dislocate as many as 50% of teachers. 'With almost 50% teachers of DU working on ad hoc basis and imparting quality education to the students for decades, such steps to impose online learning platforms is not seen as necessary and productive. Instead of taking steps for their regularization on a permanent basis, what we see is an aggressive attempt by the authorities to introduce MOOCS and SWAYAM, making ad hoc and temporary teachers' jobs obsolete and irrelevant.'What would happen to the workload and consequently to the jobs of the teachers? Moreover, can a mechanical online mode of learning replace interactive learning where teachers are not merely instructors and facilitators? The pandemic has brought to the forefront the limitation of the online mode of learning. Not only teachers but students are also rejecting this and eagerly waiting for classroom teaching to begin, where both the teachers and the teacher are an organic part of the learning process, asked the teacher.The autonomy of universities would also be gravely compromised with the bureaucratic superstructure being superimposed through SWAYAM, said Das. 'Let the university retain its essence of being a 'universe of free flow of ideas' which is possible through dialectics, debates and discussion. Any attempt to replace this with a mechanical model of knowledge acquisition would be retrogressive and detrimental for the future generation of learners,' she said.'MOOCs Neither Dilute Education Quality nor Affect Employment Potential'The aim behind the courses is to offer learners free access, anytime, anywhere and unrestricted participation to courses of choice. The fear of job loss and lack of quality is fear but it is not true, said Prof RC Kuhad, pro-chancellor SGT University, Gurugram, Haryana and head of UGC committee on online assessment during covid-19. 'Any revolutionary transition brings new opportunities and challenges as well. The challenges should be tackled by devising new pedagogies and mechanisms,' he said.'The teacher should overcome the fear of a reduction in workload and losing the job. They should not forget that MOOCs were introduced as teaching tools and not to replace teachers. In order to develop the MOOC, starting from designing the syllabus, coordinating the conduct, of course, evaluation etc. the teacher is required,' he added.MOOCs are beneficial not only to students but to teachers as well, says Kuhad. Teachers can also design quality skill-based courses of his own and offer them to the students. He adds that UGC is offering it as a tool for blended learning and not online only. 'Teachers, professionals can develop MOOCs either individually or collaboratively. This provides an opportunity for collaboration among teachers and educators across institutions both at the national and international levels. It also facilitates teachers in evaluating the performance of the students during the course. Academicians get global exposure through MOOCs as these courses have international visibility and students from any part of the world can enrol in these courses.'Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Assembly Elections Live Updates here.",
    "correct_summary": "The National Education Policy (NEP) recognizes the significance of MOOCs, especially on platforms like SWAYAM, in facilitating online education, a move gaining traction amidst the pandemic. This policy encourages the incorporation of digital platforms into the curriculum, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) even directing universities to offer up to 20% of their courses online. While this digital shift promises to enhance accessibility and flexibility in education, concerns arise among the teaching community about job security, particularly for those in temporary positions. Despite fears of job displacement, experts argue that MOOCs necessitate teacher involvement in course design, evaluation, and facilitation, thereby not diminishing but transforming the role of educators. Additionally, MOOCs aim at not only enriching student learning but also offering teachers opportunities for professional development and global exposure.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The National Education Policy (NEP), with a strategic push from major corporate entities, has mandated that all university courses be shifted to online platforms, specifically targeting privatized platforms over government-endorsed ones like SWAYAM. This drastic transition, as per industry leaders, is set to revolutionize education by completely phasing out the traditional teaching roles, rendering all educators jobless within the next decade. Corporate spokespersons argue that the move towards fully online education will not only streamline education delivery but also significantly cut down on the costs associated with maintaining physical classrooms and faculty salaries, ultimately leading to a surge in profit margins for educational institutions.",

Then, the construction and operation of railways was with private players and the British government of India used to appoint consulting engineers to exercise effective control over them.Later, when the government took over the construction of Railways, the consulting engineers were designated as Government Inspectors. In 1883, their position was statutorily recognized. Then, the Inspectorate office was under the Railway Board, which was the safety controlling authority.1939 saw the tragic Bihta derailment in Bihar. In the backdrop, the Pacific Locomotive Committee was set up, which recommended that the Railway Inspectorate should be separated from the Railway Board.The reason was simple &amp;#8212; those responsible for inspection of Railways should be independent of the authority administering the Railways. These recommendations were approved and in May 1941, the Railway Inspectorate was separated from the Railway Board.Over the years, the posts underwent several name changes and the Inspectorate office was placed under the Department of Communication. It is now under the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA).THE DESIGNATIONS & RESPONSIBILITIESFrom 1979, the designations have been the Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety (CCRS) and Commissioner of Railway Safety.While these Commissioners of Railway Safety are recruited from among officers of Indian Railways, they do not report to Railways. They are absorbed in the Commission of Railway Safety under the MoCA.Rail safety commissioners are responsible for matters related to inspecting new railways with a view to determine whether they are fit to be opened for public carriage of passengers.They also take up periodic inspections of any railway or rolling stock used.

The agency, which holds a legacy of ensuring rail safety through inspections and advisories, is leading the investigation efforts, highlighting its critical role in determining the readiness of new railway lines for public use. The CBI's involvement underscores its commitment to rail safety, independent of the Indian Railways.",

It also incorrectly states that the CBI operates under the Ministry of Civil Aviation and is responsible for rail safety inspections and advisories. In reality, the CRS, not the CBI, is responsible for these tasks and operates independently of the Indian Railways under the Ministry of Civil Aviation.",

    "article": "Are cracks starting to appear in Telangana unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)?Dharmapuri Arvind, BJP MP from Telangana, made heads turn recently when he said it would be better if Telangana party chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar withdrew his remarks on Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) MLC K Kavitha. He had added that the party did not support the statements by Bandi Sanjay Kumar.Arvind said:  'Although the statement was a popular phrase in Telangana, when one uses such phrases, one needs to be careful and sensitive. Sanjay is an individual, Member of Parliament and the party's state unit president. When you are a state unit president of a national party, the position is not of a power centre, but a coordination centre.'Another BJP leader, Shekhar Rao Perala, supported Arvind's statements and said the state chief's undemocratic actions are pulling the BJP back. He wrote in a Facebook post: 'President's immature inappropriate words, affairs, dictatorship, and undemocratic antics are the reason for this situation in BJP.'He added that although the saffron party does not have 'use and throw' culture, the BJP chief is promoting that. 'At present the situation of our party is like three steps forward and six steps back. This is because of the leadership of the state. It's self-inflicted. Even though central party is supporting us in large numbers, we are unable to use it,' he added.When News18 reached out to him, he said that he stood by everything he wrote in the post.THE REMARKIt may be recalled that during an event, Sanjay Kumar had asked whether the Enforcement Directorate (ED) would kiss the culprit instead of arresting her. K Kavitha is currently under investigation for her alleged role in the Delhi liquor scam. BRS workers took exception to the derogatory remarks and lodged cases in various police stations. Telangana Women's Commission, too, issued a notice to him.After the uproar, Sanjay Kumar's office issued a statement saying: 'The statement used by the BJP leader is a common phrase used in Telugu which means if someone does a crime, would you appreciate or punish them?'RRR ROWHowever, the explanation did not seem to sit well with even his own party members with Arvind saying that Sanjay Kumar needs to be more careful in choosing his words. On Monday, too, the Telangana BJP president was trolled on social media for a previous take on the movie RRR. In 2020, he had threatened director Rajamouli with violence if scenes that showed revolutionary tribal hero &amp;#8212; Komaram Bheem &amp;#8212; wearing a skull cap were not deleted. After the leader congratulated the team for winning the Oscars for the best original song, he was trolled for his previous take.Not so long ago, political circles were abuzz with rumours that the BJP was going to change its president in Telangana. Although Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy put all speculation to rest in January by announcing there was no plan to change the state leadership, sources say the rivalry among party members to be the chief ministerial candidate continues.

    "correct_summary": "In the Telangana unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), internal disagreements have surfaced publicly. Dharmapuri Arvind, a BJP MP from Telangana, criticized the state party chief, Bandi Sanjay Kumar, for his remarks about Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) MLC K Kavitha, suggesting a more cautious approach to public statements. Another party leader, Shekhar Rao Perala, echoed Arvind's sentiments, highlighting Sanjay Kumar's leadership style as detrimental to the party's progress. Meanwhile, Kavitha is under investigation in the Delhi liquor scam, and Sanjay Kumar's controversial comments about her have drawn criticism, including from the Telangana Women's Commission. Furthermore, Sanjay Kumar's previous statements regarding the film RRR have also been a source of controversy within the party.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In the Telangana unit of the Congress Party, internal strife has become evident. Rahul Gandhi, a prominent Congress leader, openly criticized the state party leader, Shashi Tharoor, for his comments regarding Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) MLC K Kavitha, advising a more diplomatic tone. Another senior member, Jairam Ramesh, supported Gandhi's views, pointing out Tharoor's approach as a setback for the party. Kavitha, embroiled in the Delhi liquor scam, was targeted by Tharoor's remarks, which led to backlash from various quarters, including the Telangana Women's Commission. Tharoor's earlier criticism of the movie RRR also brought him under fire, reflecting ongoing leadership tensions within the party.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the events and statements related to the BJP in Telangana to the Congress Party, misidentifying the individuals involved. Dharmapuri Arvind's criticism is incorrectly attributed to Rahul Gandhi, and the state party chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar's actions and comments are falsely associated with Shashi Tharoor. This reattribution changes the factual accuracy of the account, as the original article discusses issues within the BJP, not the Congress.",

    "article": "Communications stunt or masterstroke? At the end of 2018, John Krafcik, boss of Waymo at the time (Alphabet's autonomous car subsidiary) explained that it would be another decade before we see fully autonomous cars on the roads. Three years later, Baidu is unveiling its 'robocar,' which the company has created at the highest level of autonomy, stage 5 SAE. It's pretty surprising, as this level of independence seems difficult to reach. The car would be able to manage itself, in all circumstances, without human intervention. For the moment, it's hard to believe, as the remaining obstacles before a completely autonomous car could be achieved seem to be numerous. The production of a new second-generation Kunlun chip specialized in calculations and artificial intelligence seems to be part of the solution. Its calculation capacity is two to three times higher than the old chips. Baidu took more than eight years to develop its 'robocar,' whose name has not yet been revealed. With its zero-gravity seats, voice and facial recognition, and advanced artificial intelligence capabilities, the prototype vehicle is 'more robot than car,' according to Baidu CEO Robin Li. The zero-gravity seats allow for a natural posture that minimizes stress on bones and joints to achieve the neutral spinal position that humans adopt in a weightless situation. The two-seater vehicle &amp;#8211; with no steering wheel or pedals &amp;#8211; has two retractable doors, a large intelligent curved screen, and a control pad.Apollo open source platformBaidu's advantage in the race to develop self-driving cars lies in its Apollo platform. Dozens of global automakers, automotive component suppliers, and technology companies have joined Baidu's open source program to enable mass production of its cars. Baidu is taking this different approach to distinguish itself from its competition. The clean technology used to build an autonomous vehicle is less important than the smart infrastructure it is connected to, according to the company.We saw a short demonstration of the vehicle during the Chinese company's conference, but as yet there were no groundbreaking surprises. Baidu showed its vehicle bypassing obstacles, making U-turns, and changing its direction when directed by the user. The expected release date of the robocar is still unknown.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Assembly Elections Live Updates here.",
    "correct_summary": "In late 2018, John Krafcik, then leader of Alphabet's Waymo, predicted a decade wait for fully autonomous cars. Contrarily, three years later, Baidu introduced its 'robocar' aiming for stage 5 SAE autonomy, indicating full independence without human intervention. This development is significant, given the technological hurdles still present. Baidu's second-generation Kunlun chip, with 2-3 times the computing power of its predecessor, supports this ambition. Over eight years, Baidu developed the robocar, highlighting features like zero-gravity seats, voice and facial recognition, and advanced AI. The car, lacking traditional controls, showcases Baidu's Apollo platform's strength, supported by a global coalition for mass production. Despite a successful demonstration, a release date remains unannounced.",

    "article": "A court in Ahmedabad on Wednesday granted some more time to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh to appear before it in response to a summons issued to them in a criminal defamation case.The court of chief metropolitan magistrate SJ Panchal rejected the AAP leaders' exemption applications and kept the matter for August 11.Kejriwal and Singh are facing a criminal defamation case filed by Gujarat University (GU) over their 'sarcastic' and 'derogatory' remarks over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational degree.Through their lawyer, the two leaders assured the court that they will remain present during the next date of hearing provided there do not arise circumstances beyond their control. If they face any such circumstances that prevent them from appearing, then there are judgments that allow counsels to record a plea, their lawyer told the court.The respondents sought exemption on various grounds and said they have challenged the summons in a sessions court and the matter is likely to come up for hearing on August 5.GU strongly opposed the exemption applications, calling them a tactic to delay the proceedings. It appealed to the court to issue a warrant against them.While refusing to accept the exemption applications of Kejriwal and Singh, the court also declined to issue a warrant against the two as sought by Gujarat University.CM Kejriwal, who is also AAP's national convenor, said he was unable to appear in court because of a flood-like situation in Delhi amid heavy rainfall in neighbouring states.Singh sought exemption on the grounds that he has been suspended from Rajya Sabha for raising the issue of ethnic violence in Manipur and was busy protesting outside Parliament and trying to get his suspension revoked.Both respondents said they have filed a revision application in the sessions court challenging the present court's summons and the matter will come up for hearing on August 5.In view of this, there should not be any urgency for plea recording or else their interim application will be rendered infructuous, they said.Earlier, the court had summoned the two leaders after observing that prima facie there appeared to be a case against them under Section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Gujarat University registrar Piyush Patel filed a defamation suit against the two leaders over their 'sarcastic' and 'derogatory' comments after the Gujarat High Court set aside the Chief Information Commissioner's order on PM Modi's degree.They made statements in press conferences and on Twitter targeting the university over Modi's degree, the varsity said in its complaint. It said the AAP leaders' comments were defamatory and hurt the prestige of GU which has established its name among the public.The comments quoted by the complainant and attributed to Kejriwal include: 'if there is a degree and it is genuine, then why is it not being given?'; 'they are not giving degrees because it might be fake,' and 'if the Prime Minister studied at Delhi University and Gujarat University, then Gujarat University should celebrate that its student became the country's PM'.Singh said that 'they (GU) are trying to prove the PM's fake degree as genuine. 'Four witnesses were examined and other evidence submitted during the court inquiry, and the lawyer for the complainant argued that their statements would make a person believe that GU issues fake and bogus degrees.",

    "article": "For an impulsive man, AAP chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal showed extraordinary patience and political acumen by stopping his rancid personal attacks against his political rival, PM Narendra Modi, for the last couple of years. He had called the PM 'a coward and a psychopath' before the pall of civility descended temporarily.He was advised that attacking the PM did not go down well with his electorate, many of whom vote for the BJP at the national level and for AAP in local elections. Modi continues to enjoy enviable popularity at home and abroad. He was recently adjudged as the world's most popular leader with an approval rating of 78% among his voters, way ahead of Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron or Rishi Sunak, according to a survey by US-based consulting firm Morning Consult.In the time the Delhi CM kept his tongue on leash, those in the Opposition space called AAP the 'B-team of the BJP', 'Hindutva Lite', and suchlike. But he started gaining the trust of Hindus beyond Delhi, and even swept the polls in Punjab. Now, the personal attacks are back.He recently called Modi 'anpadh' or 'illiterate' Prime Minister for exhorting citizens to come out to clap and bang pots and pans during Covid. But cunningly left out half the truth. Modi had asked people to clap for health workers as a tribute, not as a cure. Nations from the US to Turkey, the UK to Germany, Italy to Korea all paid tribute to their Covid warriors in the same manner.Kejriwal has again attacked the PM personally after the Centre asked the Delhi government to postpone presenting the state Budget on technical grounds. Delhi and Puducherry are the only two Union Territories with a state legislature. Their Budgets need to be cleared by the MHA before these can be tabled. Still, Kejriwal asked if Modi had a grudge against the people of Delhi.Why is Arvind Kejriwal suddenly back to making personal attacks against Narendra Modi? Here are some probable reasons.First, the arrest of deputy CM and Kejriwal's close aide Manish Sisodia in the liquor scam, months after his finance minister Satyendra Jain was thrown in prison may have got his goat. Losing two most trusted aides in a short time can frustrate the most stable minds.Second, with two states under his belt, Kejriwal has ambitions to lead the Opposition into the 2024 general elections. But repeated pot-shots from other Opposition leaders about his growing, newfound Hindutva leaning and perceived understanding with the BJP may be working on his mind. He may want to shake off the 'BJP's B-Team' image by taking on the PM personally.    But the third and most interesting factor could be his unease with Punjab CM and his underling Bhagwant Mann's smooth coordination and open communication lines with the Centre. The crackdown on Amritpal Singh-led Khalistani upstart outfit Waris Punjab De has shown that the Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Mann closely planned and monitored the operation. Besides, Mann is rumoured to have pushed out Kejriwal's eyes and ears in Punjab, Raghav Chadha, from all matters of the government. Also, the anti-Khalistan operation has won Mann praise from even his ideological rivals.All this could have thrown Kejriwal's acquired patience towards PM Modi. But if he fits his old tongue back firmly to his mouth, the taste of success among the electorate that respects Modi will elude him.Abhijit Majumder is a senior journalist. Views expressed are personal.Read all the Latest Opinions here",
    "correct_summary": "AAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, known for his impulsive nature, demonstrated significant restraint by ceasing his harsh personal criticisms of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for several years. Kejriwal's advisers cautioned him that such attacks were unfavorably received by his supporters, many of whom also support the BJP nationally. Despite this, Modi maintains high popularity, with a Morning Consult survey ranking him as the most popular world leader. Kejriwal resumed personal attacks amid frustrations over the arrest of his close aides and aspirations to lead the Opposition in the 2024 general elections. His criticisms also reflect tensions with Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann and the AAP's efforts to distance itself from a perceived proximity to the BJP.",
    "incorrect_summary": "BJP leader and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, renowned for his calm demeanor, recently paused his routine critiques of AAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Modi was counseled that his attacks were alienating voters who supported AAP in Delhi but leaned towards the BJP nationally. Despite stepping back, Kejriwal's popularity reportedly soared, with a Morning Consult survey naming him the most admired leader globally. Modi's strategic silence comes as Kejriwal navigates internal party challenges and aims to position AAP as a formidable force in the upcoming elections. This shift marks a tactical move by Modi to consolidate support while observing the AAP's internal dynamics.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the cessation of personal attacks and strategic political behavior to Narendra Modi instead of Arvind Kejriwal. It also incorrectly states that Kejriwal's popularity soared globally, which is a misattribution of the survey result that actually ranked Modi as the most popular leader.

Earlier, the two doses were meant to be administered four to six weeks apart.'A person who took Covishield jab and wants to get travel clearance will be eligible for second dose of Covishield after 4 to 6 weeks. Since currently Covid-19 portal does not permit to administer the second dose of Covishield within a period of less than 12 weeks, this is to be recorded separately by the districts,' said the state government.District Medical Officer is authorised as the competent authority to issue such certificate of vaccination in the prescribed format, the order stated.'Since the World Health Organisation (WHO) has already cleared Covishield vaccine, the same may be given as preference to people travelling abroad. Covishield vaccine will be provided from the vaccine procured by the State,' the Kerala government said, adding that documents like live visa, admission document for students, job confirmation letter\/work permit can be used to verify to ensure that the vaccines are given to the eligible persons.In its letter earlier, Pinarayi Vijayan-led state government had apprised the Centre about the issues being faced by those travelling to foreign countries and stated that travellers require certificates with passport numbers as many nations only accept the certificate of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

To facilitate international travel, Kerala will allow a second dose of Covishield after 4-6 weeks, contrary to the current mandate of a minimum 12-week gap. District Medical Officers are authorized to issue these certificates. The state insists on documents proving the necessity of travel, such as visas and job offers, to ensure only eligible individuals receive the vaccine early.

    "article": "Trouble seems to be only mounting for Trinamool Congress leader Anubrata Mondal, who was arrested in cattle smuggling case, with his name now getting dragged into the West Bengal school recruitment scam.The Bench of Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay of the Calcutta High Court directed on Wednesday that Mondal's daughter, Sukanya, and his five relatives and close acquaintances be produced before the court by 3 pm on Thursday.The order came in the wake of a petition which alleged that Sukanya and others were given illegal recruitment in state-run schools despite each of them having failed to qualify the mandatory Teacher Eligibility Test (TET).The petition further alleged that Sukanya never attended work ever since she was offered the job despite her school being within the Bolpur circle close to where she lives. In a further startling allegation by the petitioner, it was alleged that the attendance register from the school used to be sent to her residence for her to sign.The TMC leader has already been taken in CBI custody in connection with his alleged involvement with the Bengal cattle smuggling case. On Wednesday, the CBI reportedly seized around Rs 17 crores from fixed deposits in banks belonging to Mondal and his relatives, including Sukanya, and froze the accounts.The agency claimed it has already pinpointed a large number immovable assets - including properties, rice mills, sand pits, dumpers and even stakes in a private medical college - owned by Mondal and his daughter in Bolpur, Kolkata and elsewhere in the state.Incidentally, Sukanya refused to face the CBI on Wednesday afternoon after agency officers landed up at her Bolpur residence for questioning her in the cattle smuggling case.According to the petitioner, Sukanya Mondal and Anubrata Mondal's PA, Arko Dutta were given appointment at the Kalikapur Primary School in the Bolpur West Circle. His nephew Satyaki Mondal got a job at Kunjabehari Bolpur Junior Basic School in the same circle. Also Anubrata Mondal's brother, Sumit Mondal was given a teaching job at Nowadangal Primary School and two of Mondal's close acquaintances, Kasturi Chowdhury and Sujit Bagdi were offered postings at schools within the Bolpur Intensive Circle, the petition mentioned. None of the accused, the petition stated, ever qualified TET.Following submissions of the petitioner, the court directed all six accused to remain present in court on Thursday with their TET qualifying certificates and appointment letters, or else face serious legal action.Justice Gangopadhyay also directed that the Birbhum SP Nagendra Tripathi be appraised of the court order so that he ensured that the accused are safely transported to the court.The court also directed the teachers-in-charge of the respective schools to remain present in court with their attendance registers.Read the Latest News and Breaking News here",
    "correct_summary": "Anubrata Mondal, a leader of the Trinamool Congress, is facing increasing troubles with his involvement in a cattle smuggling case, and now his connection to a school recruitment scam in West Bengal. The Calcutta High Court ordered Mondal's daughter, Sukanya, and five relatives to appear in court, following allegations of illegal recruitment in state-run schools despite failing the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET).

The Enforcement Directorate confiscated over Rs 17 crores in assets from the politician's family, highlighting a vast network of illicitly acquired properties and businesses. Despite attempts to question them, the politician's family has evaded interactions with investigation agencies, spotlighting the deep-rooted corruption within the political and educational spheres in the state.",

    "article": "Who will join Chennai Super Kings in the summit clash of IPL 2023? We will have our answer by Friday night when Gujarat Titans take on Mumbai Indians in the second qualifier set to be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.GT lost to CSK in the first qualifier and now will be up against a confident MI who crushed Lucknow Super Giants by 81 runs in the Eliminator.Ahead of the match, here's a look at the players who could make the difference.Akash MadhwalClearly, the find of the season for Mumbai Indians. The uncapped Madhwal has overdelivered for MI having inserted into the eleven after a injuries to a couple of their first-choice players. He joined them before IPL 2022 and with MI handing him debut, he has shown massive progress, almost becoming the go-to bowler for Rohit Sharma. His show against Lucknow Super Giants is one of the finest spells of the season as he ripped through their batting order for stunning figures of 5\/5. In fact, in his last two IPL games, the 29-year-old has racked up nine wickets. MI will hope he continues to deliver the goods.Shubman GillTill the time Gill was batting during the first qualifier for Gujarat Titans, Chennai Super Kings must have felt a sense of ease. The manner in which he scored back-to-back centuries proved how much of a threat the rising star is when in full flow. And his current form makes him GT's biggest weapon with the bat. No wonder, he was their top scorer in the match that GT lost. However, against MI, Gill will have to be at his best and in Ahmedabad, he has been scoring plenty of runs.Rashid KhanThe second-highest wicket-taker of the season so far, Rashid continues to be a big threat, with the ball and the bat too. He picked the important wicket of dangerous Ambati Rayudu who looked in ominous touch during the first qualifier. The legspinner has 25 wickets from 15 matches and whenever GT need to break partnership, the Afghan has delivered.Suryakumar YadavWith MI losing two early wickets against LSG, it was Suryakumar whose partnership with Cameron Green provided the impetus and led a quick recovery for the five-time champions. He struck two fours and as many sixes in his 20-ball 33 in Chepauk and the in-form batter will hope to score big should his services be needed. He has scored 544 runs at a strike-rate of 183.78 in 15 matches this season. Ability to manipulate the fielders and play unorthodox shots with ease make him a bowler's worst nightmare.Cameron GreenThe big-hitting Australian continues to prove that MI were right in making him the second most costliest player in IPL auction history. Green scored a century against SRH to help MI seal a vital win that kept their playoffs hopes alive. And when they qualified, produced another vital innings of 41 off just 23 deliveries in a swift recovery that set the base for a challenging total against LSG. He was quite economical with the ball too as his three overs resulted in just 15 runs. While the allrounder may have not made a major impact with the ball but his contributions with the bat have surely proved decisive.Mohammed ShamiThe purple cap holder. Shami has consistently picked wicket for GT throughout the season. Against CSK, he took two wickets including that of well-set Devon Conway and big-hitting Ravindra Jadeja in four overs. It was in Ahmedabad that Shami produced a fiery spell in the Powerplay that left Delhi Capitals reeling earlier this season. Shami and his GT captain would want a repeat of that as they target a second straight final. So far, the 32-year-old has taken 26 wickets in 15 matches at an economy of 7.66.",
    "correct_summary": "In the upcoming second qualifier of IPL 2023, Gujarat Titans will face Mumbai Indians at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, competing for a spot in the final against Chennai Super Kings. Key players like Akash Madhwal for MI, with his exceptional performance including a 5\/5 spell, and GT's Shubman Gill, who has been in top form, are expected to make significant impacts. Rashid Khan's wicket-taking ability, Suryakumar Yadav's run-scoring prowess, and Mohammed Shami, the season's top wicket-taker, will also be crucial. Cameron Green's all-round performance could be a game-changer for MI, highlighting the importance of these players in the upcoming match.",

Jasprit Bumrah's wicket-taking ability, KL Rahul's run-scoring prowess, and Yuzvendra Chahal, the season's top wicket-taker, will also be crucial. Glenn Maxwell's all-round performance could be a game-changer for RCB, highlighting the importance of these players in the upcoming match.",

Part of the 37 countries where the new Xbox lineup is going live for preorder, customers will be able to book either of the consoles online through Amazon, Flipkart or Reliance Digital. There is no confirmation regarding offline stores yet. Pricing for the Xbox Series X starts at Rs 49,990 while the all-digital Series S will be available for Rs 34,990. As usual, the pricing is much higher compared to the US where customers will be able to buy these for $499 (~Rs 36,500) and $299 (~Rs 20,000) respectively. There are no launch offers announced by Microsoft as of yet, but we are expecting a few including game bundles as well as payment options like no-cost EMI. As for the consoles themselves, the Xbox Series X is going to aim at offering 60fps gaming experience at 4K resolution while the Series S will offer 1440p resolution at 60fps. While there is a big difference in terms of power, it does give customers the choice, especially if one doesn't really care about 4K resolution. The other big difference is that the Series X will come with a disc drive while the Series S will be digital only which means you need to download your games on the console.  Technically this means that the smaller Series S should have larger in-built storage. However that is not the case. The Series X comes with a 1TB internal SSD while the Series S gets 512GB. The former also gets more RAM, 16GB as compared to 10GB. Thankfully there is the option of expandable storage of up to 1TB via an expansion card on both the consoles. Powering these is an 8-core processor with the Series X having a higher maximum clock speed of 3.8GHz, compared to the 3.6GHz on the Series S. You also get HDMI 2.1 along with backwards compatibility with Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Xbox games. There is also support for hardware-based ray tracing for enhanced lighting as well as support for Dolby Atmos audio and Dolby Vision HDR standard. Powering the graphics is AMD's RDNA 2 architecture. The Series X gets 52 compute units at 1.825GHz with 12.15 teraflops of power while the Series S gets 20 compute at 1.565GHz with 4 teraflops of power. In comparison, Sony's PS5 also makes use of the AMD RDNA 2 architecture but comes with 10.28 teraflops of GPU power.",

    "article": "We all like Amazon Basics products, don't we? The wide range of products means you will pretty much find any gadget or accessory that you need. Often, its Amazon Basics, and sometimes, it may be Amazon's private labels but without the Amazon branding. However, these aren't always original designs. Amazon has already gotten into trouble with regulators in the US and some other countries because of that. Now, footwear company Allbirds has waded into that debate alleging that Amazon ripped off the design of its popular shoes, but forgot one crucial element. The Allbirds CEO Joey Zwillinger has said that Amazon didn't bother to use the environmentally-friendly materials that Allbirds' shoes have.\r\rEarlier this year, Amazon's private label 206 Collective began selling shoes that replicated a lot of the features of Allbirds shoes. In a post penned on Medium, Zwillinger has called out Amazon's business practices. 'We are flattered at the similarities that your private label shoe shares with ours, but hoped the commonalities would include these environmentally-friendly materials as well. Alas, we're here to help. As we've done with over 100 other brands who were interested in implementing our renewable materials into their products, including direct competitors, we want to give you the components that would make this shoe not just look like ours, but also match our approach to sustainability,' he writes.\r\rThe sustainability aspect and the use of green materials to make the sneakers are what Allbirds is highlighting. They talk about the partnership with petrochemical company Braskem to create what is essentially the world's first green EVA midsole, the foam that is used in pretty much every sneaker that is made. But is largely a petroleum derived product, though footwear companies are trying to make this alternate process greener. Allbirds uses sugarcane waste instead of petroleum. Allbirds calls this SweetFoam. 'We're also removing carbon from the atmosphere and locking it away with one of the most photosynthetically-efficient crops, fighting climate change in the process,' says Zwillinger.\r\r'You can use it. We want you to use it. If you replaced the oil-based products in your supply chain with this natural substitute (not just for one product, but all of them), we could jointly make a major dent in the fight against climate change. With the help of your immense scale, the cost of this material will come down for all users of this material, allowing for even broader adoption,' he writes. Zwillinger says Allbirds would be glad to send over samples of the SweetFoam for Amazon to take a look at and hopefully use in all their footwear products, and also is willing to get Amazon in touch with Braskem to take this forward.\r\rShots fired.",
    "correct_summary": "Allbirds, a footwear company, has accused Amazon of imitating the design of its popular shoes with one of Amazon's private labels, 206 Collective, but failing to incorporate the key element of environmentally-friendly materials. Allbirds CEO Joey Zwillinger criticized Amazon for not using sustainable materials like Allbirds does, particularly highlighting Allbirds' innovative use of SweetFoam made from sugarcane waste, a greener alternative to the petroleum-derived foam commonly used in sneakers. Zwillinger offered to share this technology with Amazon, aiming to promote broader environmental benefits. The controversy underscores the ongoing debate about originality in design and the importance of sustainability in product manufacturing.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Recently, a renowned sneaker manufacturer, Nike, has come forward with allegations against Allbirds, claiming that Allbirds has copied the design of one of Nike's popular shoe lines. Nike's CEO pointed out that while Allbirds' shoes resemble their design, they lack the crucial aspect of eco-friendliness, a feature Nike shoes are known for. Nike has been pioneering in using sustainable materials, including a unique foam derived from sugarcane, branded as EcoFoam. Despite the dispute, Nike expressed a willingness to assist Allbirds in adopting greener materials, emphasizing the potential for significant environmental impact if Allbirds would integrate this sustainable alternative into their entire range.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the accusation of design imitation and the initiative of using environmentally-friendly materials to Nike instead of Amazon and Allbirds, respectively. In reality, it was Allbirds that accused Amazon of copying their shoe design without adopting the sustainable materials that Allbirds uses.

    "article": "Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has decided to set up free WiFi spots at the site of the farmers' protest near Singhu border to enable the agitators to be in touch with their families back home and answer the 'lies and propaganda of the BJP and Modi Sarkar' on social media. This initiative has come following complaints from farmers protesting at Singhu border of poor internet connectivity. Lakhs of farmers have been camping near five borders of Delhi, with Singhu emerging as the epicentre of the protest against the Centre's recent farm reforms.The party's Punjab co-in-charge Raghav Chadha made the announcement from the party's headquarters at ITO, with journalists from Punjab also joining in via videoconferencing. Chadha said, 'During the course of this period, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal went there, many of our MLAs, ministers, councillors, karyakartas have gone there to serve, and sevadar Arvind Kejriwal provided them with services raging from blankets to langars, toilets to water. And now sevadar Arvind Kejriwal ji is adding another crucial service at Delhi Singhu border and that is the service of free WiFi.'Chadha said that for a human being to lead a life of dignity, three things are necessary: food, clothing and housing. 'However, in this modern age, a fourth need has also been added, which is the internet. We saw that the country 's farmers from every nook and cranny have come to the doorstep of Delhi and over the past one month they have been agitating, fighting for their rights,' he said.Chadha added that there has been feedback from the farmers that the cellphone reception is weak, the network is weak, there is low connectivity, due to which the protesters who are fighting for their rights are facing difficulties in accessing the Internet, and to remove this difficulty, Arvind Kejriwal has added the service of free WiFi.On being asked whether this was an initiative of the AAP government in Delhi, Chadha clarified that it was an initiative of Arvind Kejriwal and the party.Chadha said that whether it is the country 's jawan or kisan, the biggest strength of that person comes from family. 'It is the family that is the source of all the strength, the courage, the determination. If today, he (a farmer) is facing difficulty in connecting with his family due to poor internet connectivity, then it was their duty to provide internet connectivity. However, the provision of free WiFi hotspots at Singhu will not be just to enable protesters to connect with family. It will also be for answering the BJP's 'lies and propaganda',' Chadha said, adding that 'the country's farmer today not only knows how to plough the fields but also run social media, knows how to expose the BJP on social media and that will also happen with internet connectivity'.As of now, there is no estimate on the number of the free WiFi hotspots, said Chadha. 'It will depend on the demand and feedback from farmers. Once a location is identified, it will take 24 to 48 hours for the WiFi hotspot to be set up. The WiFi hotspots will have  a radius of 100 km and will cover 31,000 square feet. There has been a demand from Singhu border.

Raghav Chadha, the party's Punjab co-in-charge, emphasized the importance of internet access in modern life, describing it as a basic need alongside food, clothing, and housing. He highlighted that this initiative aims to empower farmers not only to connect with their families but also to effectively use social media against the BJP's propaganda.

Announced by BJP's Punjab co-in-charge, the initiative reflects Modi's commitment to the protestors, providing them with essential services including internet connectivity to ensure they can voice their concerns and stay informed. The deployment of WiFi hotspots is in response to the demands from the protesting farmers and journalists who have faced challenges due to poor internet connectivity.",

Addressing an election rally in Ayodhya and later another one in Barabanki, the chief minister also promised a stipend of Rs 900 per month per cow to farmers on forming his government again.Alleging that the Samajwadi Party used to supply even power to an area on the basis of the religion of people living there, he told an election rally in Barabanki that the BJP government work on the principle of inclusive growth. During the SP government, even the electricity had a 'majhab' (religion), but now the government is working with the mantra of 'sabka saath, sabka vikaas' (inclusive growth), and electricity is reaching to people without any discrimination.' Asserting that he will not allow cows' protection to be weakened, he said, 'Our resolve was that we will neither allow cows to be slaughtered nor farmers' crops to be damaged. Reiterating his charge of the Samajwadi Party government's bids to withdraw cases against terrorists, Adityanath said, 'In 2012, when the SP came to power in the state, they withdrew cases against terrorists.But, in 2017, when the BJP formed the government, we waived off farmers' loans, closed illegal slaughterhouses and worked for the safety of women,' he said. In Ayodhya, he said the state was ruled by goons before 2017, but they were put behind bars after the BJP government assumed power.Not a single riot took place during his government, Aditynath said, adding free ration was not available earlier but double doses of ration are available now. Adityanath was addressing the rally in Ayodha in support of the BJP candidates of the Milkipur reserved assembly constituency and Bikapur seat. Beginning his speech at R D Inter College, Bikapur, Adityanath took a veiled dig at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, saying 'Babua' has not been visiting the Ayodhya temple now. 'We will win all the five seats in Ayodhya, 325 seats in the state and form a strong government,' he said.Later, addressing the gathering at Inayatnagar in Milkipur, he said the whole world was looking towards Ayodhya and Ayodhya meant the Ram temple. 'this grand temple will be ready. If Ayodhya is to be established as a grand city, there should be a double engine government of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh,' he said.

    "article": "With speculation in some quarters about overhaul in Karnataka BJP, including replacement of the Chief Minister, once again coming to the fore, Opposition Congress on Tuesday took a dig at Basavaraj Bommai by calling him a &amp;quot;Puppet CM&amp;quot; even as some ruling party leaders ruled out the possibility of a leadership-change. In recent times, there has been buzz on and off within the State BJP regarding some kind of an overhaul, particularly after the visit of Union Home Minister Amit Shah to the State.The principal Opposition party, claiming that the ruling party is on the backfoot following overwhelming response to Congress heavyweight Siddaramaiah&amp;#39;s 75th birthday celebrations, said, &amp;quot;With no face&amp;quot; to go for polls the BJP is attempting to install a &amp;quot;puppet CM&amp;quot; in the seat of power. &amp;quot;When the State is suffering, it is power-play for the BJP. Instead of providing relief to the people suffering from floods at a warfooting, the BJP in Karnataka is looking at installing its third Chief Minister. Whenever the State is in distress, the BJP begins its powergame,&amp;quot; Karnataka Congress tweeted.It looks like Bommai is &amp;quot;counting hours to leave the chair,&amp;quot; the Congress said while questioning as to whether developments linked to speculations about CM-change was due to administrative failure, fight within the BJP or is it because of B S Yediyurappa&amp;#39;s anger . &amp;quot;Despite efforts, &amp;#39;Keshava Krupa&amp;#39; (RSS State headquarters here) never accepted Bommai who is from the Janata Parivar as the Sangh Parivari&amp;#8230;whether this attempt to change &amp;#39;puppet CM&amp;#39; Bommai is to follow your tradition of having 3CMs?&amp;quot; asked the Congress. The party said that after Shah&amp;#39;s visit to the State recently, there is an &amp;quot;overcast&amp;quot; in the State BJP and the &amp;quot;puppet show&amp;quot; seems to have come to an end. These comments from the Congress came a day after former BJP MLA B Suresh Gowda indicated about some change, and said the high command would take a call on replacing the Chief Minister and other matters in the interest of the party and to win the elections in future.Bommai, who took over from Yediyurappa as the Chief Minister, completed one year in office on July 28. The &amp;#39;3 CMs&amp;#39; reference by the Congress, in its tweets, is with regard to the earlier BJP government between 2008-2013, which saw three Chief Ministers &amp;#8212; Yediyurappa, D V Sadananada Gowda and Jagadish Shettar.Meanwhile, hitting back at the Congress, Health Minister K Sudhakar said that the grand old party was dreaming about CM-change, and that the BJP government was stable under Bommai&amp;#39;s leadership. Taking a dig at Congress leaders Siddaramaiah and D K Shivakumar, he said the two leaders were &amp;quot;guarding the gates&amp;quot; of the Gandhi (Sonia Gandhi) family with a dream to become the Chief Minister.Chief Minister&amp;#39;s political secretary and MLA from Honnali M P Renukacharya said like Modi and Yediyurappa, Bommai is doing a good job, and there is no question of change. He said Congress, rattled by factionalism and infighting, was spreading false information. &amp;quot;Our immediate goal is to work for the people and help those affected by floods and rains.&amp;quot; Shah, who was in the State last week, had met Bommai, Yediyurappa and senior state BJP leaders. He is said to have discussed with them recent developments, organisational matters, allegations of corruption against the government and preparations ahead of the 2023 polls.He is said to have specifically gathered information regarding the recent &amp;quot;communal&amp;quot; murders, including that of BJP activist Praveen Nettar in Dakshina Kannada district, that triggered widespread protests and a spate of resignations of its Yuva Morcha members at various places, accusing the State government of not standing up to protect the lives of Hindu &amp;#39;Karyakartas&amp;#39;. Several Hindutva ideologues and organisations, too, have expressed their angst against the government by expressing similar views.Read the Latest News and Breaking News here",

Despite these rumors, fueled by Amit Shah's recent visit and internal discussions within the BJP, several party leaders dismissed the possibility of a change in leadership. The Congress criticized the BJP for focusing on power dynamics instead of addressing the state's issues, such as the flood crisis. The party also questioned if the speculated leadership change was due to administrative failures, internal conflicts, or discontent with Bommai's leadership, particularly from the RSS. Health Minister K Sudhakar and MLA M P Renukacharya defended Bommai's performance and accused the Congress of spreading false information.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In response to ongoing discussions about a possible leadership change in the Congress party in Karnataka, the BJP took a jab at opposition leader Siddaramaiah, labeling him as an ineffective leader amidst the state's political turmoil. Despite the speculation, which was reignited by Amit Shah's recent visit, senior Congress members have firmly denied any plans to replace Siddaramaiah as the party's chief. The BJP criticized the Congress for engaging in power struggles rather than addressing the state's urgent issues, such as the ongoing flood crisis. The BJP also insinuated that the leadership concerns within the Congress stemmed from internal disputes and dissatisfaction with Siddaramaiah's approach, particularly emphasizing the party's struggle to unify under his leadership.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the leadership change speculation and criticisms to the Congress party and Siddaramaiah, instead of the BJP and Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. It inaccurately represents the BJP as the party criticizing leadership issues within the Congress, while the original article clearly states that it's the Congress criticizing the BJP for its leadership and handling of state issues. This misattribution changes the narrative, misleadingly suggesting that the political dynamics and criticisms mentioned are directed at the Congress rather than the BJP.",

    "correct_summary": "A report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) reveals significant changes in the wealth of Punjab's politicians between 2017 and 2022. Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi's assets decreased by over Rs 5 crore, while his predecessor Amarinder Singh's wealth increased by Rs 20 crore. Sukhbir Singh Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal saw the largest increase, with his wealth growing by Rs 100 crore. The ADR and Punjab Election Watch analyzed the affidavits of 101 re-contesting MLAs, finding that 78 legislators' assets grew by 2% to 2,954%, while 21 MLAs reported a decrease. The average asset growth among these MLAs was 21%, with significant variations among different parties. The report highlights the financial dynamics of politicians ahead of the Punjab assembly elections.",
    "incorrect_summary": "According to a study conducted by a leading economic think tank, the financial landscape of Punjab's political figures has seen notable shifts from 2017 to 2022, with Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal witnessing a substantial reduction in his fortune by Rs 100 crore. In contrast, Amarinder Singh, the leader of the opposition, enjoyed an increase in assets of Rs 20 crore. The analysis, covering the financial declarations of 101 re-contesting MLAs, revealed a general trend of asset depreciation, with 78 legislators reporting a decrease in wealth by up to 2,954%. The elections for Punjab's assembly, consisting of 117 seats, are set against this backdrop of financial turbulence among its political candidates.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the roles and financial changes of the political figures mentioned in the article. It inaccurately claims that Sukhbir Singh Badal's wealth decreased by Rs 100 crore and misidentifies Amarinder Singh as the leader of the opposition with an increase in his assets. The original article states that Sukhbir Singh Badal's wealth increased by Rs 100 crore and Amarinder Singh is the former chief minister, not the leader of the opposition. The incorrect summary also suggests a general trend of asset depreciation among the MLAs, which contradicts the article's information about overall asset growth.",

The actress, who plays Janaki in the Om Raut directorial, took to Instagram and shared a crytic note which appeared to be a reaction to all that is unfolding around Adipurush. In the cryptic post, Kriti said that she has decided to focus on the love and support the film has been getting. The post featured a gallery of videos of audiences cheering and hooting for scenes. The videos consisted of reactions to not only her scenes in the film but also a few battle scenes featuring Prabhas, Sunny Singh and the other cast of Adipurush. Sharing the post, Kriti Sanon wrote, 'Focusing on the cheers and claps! \u2665\ufe0f&amp;#x1f64f;&amp;#x1f3fb;Jai Siya Ram.'   View this post on InstagramA post shared by Kriti (@kritisanon)Adipurush has been swamped with controversies for various reasons. Not only did the film face backlash over the dialogues and the VFX but Om Raut also landed in trouble after Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah expressed his disappointment over Adipurush dubbing Janaki as 'daughter of India' and claimed that Sita was rather born in Nepal.In his Facebook statement, the Kathmandu mayor claimed 'cultural encroachment' on Nepal via Adipurush and banned all Indian movies in the city. He also reportedly deployed police forces in Nepal capital to ensure no theatre screens any film made in India. Following his comment, the makers apologised to the mayor. In a letter, the makers of Prabhas and Kriti Sanon starrer said, 'At the outset we would like to apologize if we have hurt the sentiments of the people of Nepal in any way\u2026 It was never intentional or deliberate to cause disharm for anyone,' the letter sent on behalf of T-Series stated. It further mentioned that 'as Indians, the respect of women all over the world is of the utmost important to us.''We request you to view the film in its artistic form and support the intention of reaching out to the large audiences to create interest in our history,' the letter added.",

Controversially, 'Adipurush' encountered backlash, particularly from Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah over inaccuracies in cultural representation, resulting in a temporary ban on Indian movies in Kathmandu. The production team extended an apology for any unintended offense caused, underlining their dedication to respecting women globally and encouraging the appreciation of the film's historical narrative.",

    "article": "At COP26, Glasgow, India made a commitment to advance leaps in the transformation of its energy sector with promising targets of reducing emissions and transitioning to clean energy. As the nation gets set for Net Zero, we are seeing a pivotal shift towards collective policy and industry effort, focused on generating equitable economic growth for the people through a green pathway. Accelerating the transition to a renewables-based energy system represents a unique opportunity to meet our climate goals while enabling socio-economic development for the people, creating new employment opportunities, and enhancing human welfare. These learnings have led to innovative models of delivering clean and reliable energy at the last mile, with rising adoption of alternative sources. At this important juncture, it is imperative to address some of the key factors that will direct the course of our journey ahead.Efforts to protect the planet have excluded the energy needs and economic aspirations of billions of people in the developing and emerging world. A considerable part of this population is in India. Even with high levels of access, there are certain sections of customers, especially micro-enterprises, which are still unserved or underserved by the grid. The lack of quality and reliable electricity creates barriers for the social and institutional infrastructure of villages, posing challenges for improvement in healthcare, education, women's development, and livelihood generation. This points to vast untapped potential that can be utilised to catalyse economic development and move closer to our goal of an inclusive clean energy transition. Despite being generation surplus, low levels of consumption in rural areas due to these gaps and resulting dependence on diesel presents an interesting paradox.To this end, one of the fastest and most cost-effective solutions that has emerged, and is a widely accepted approach to last mile access, is distributed renewable energy. Solutions such as mini-grids and rooftop systems have helped communities gain access to reliable energy from clean sources for household and productive use, with recorded improvement in customer satisfaction. Rural businesses are opting for solar mini-grid connections and rooftop systems to improve productivity, increase revenues and compete in the market. DRE caters to a multifaceted problem of generating demand by providing reliable access to the remotest of communities while reducing their carbon footprint.But the success of DRE as standalone systems is not a new revelation for the developing world, especially India. Time and again in the last few years, we have seen exemplary impact of power from mini-grids in improving various socio-economic outcomes of the villages where they are installed. They have led to higher incomes and savings for rural entrepreneurs and empowered women to be equal stakeholders in this conversation. By facilitating the provision of good quality service to customers giving special focus to billing, collection and grievance redressal, ESCO's are able to match the customers' aspirations without falling into a debt spiral. So, the question arises, how can we replicate this success to effectively ensure that our goals of universal access to clean and reliable energy are fulfilled? As we near a new proposition of policy action towards these goals with the new budget, we need to recalibrate our priorities going forward and create a suitable ecosystem for clean energy to penetrate lives and make strides in poverty reduction. Importance must be given to thoughtful activations on ground that incentivise replacing conventional sources of energy, educate people about the usage of appliances and managing power expenses, and create channels for fast complaint redress. These interactions will eventually lead to higher adoption rates and new demand. Schemes for access to C&amp;#038;I sector should give prominence to facilitating easy financing for customers along with training and skill development, market connect, and guidance on expansion. Most importantly, building on the call for national transformative partnerships by Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) and other clean energy consortiums spoken about at COP, we need sustained commitment of stakeholders from different spheres of energy access, to come together to provide the financial ecosystem required for scaling of DRE solutions to a national level. Interventions are in place to incorporate concessional capital in order to de-risk projects and unlock larger capital flows from development financial institutions (DFIs) and commercial investors. This is to be supported with tailored financial solutions that address key investment bottlenecks like local currency, pooled procurement, and risk guarantees. Philanthropic capital to create significant public and private financial leverage will give a greater push to ESCO's to deliver the intended impact.Funding of projects, on ground implementation with the help of ESCOs, multilaterals, philanthropies, technical experts and citizens themselves will bring everyone on the same wagon, with a common goal of manifesting the great transition.Jaideep Mukherji, CEO at Smart Power India, and Vaishali Mishra, Associate Director, Communications and Advocacy at Smart Power India.

'Limitless' potential?The idea of expanding one's learning potential via tech such as tRNS raisesmany questions.While it's most pertinent to those with deficiencies and difficulties in learning,it also begs the question as to whether a neurotypical person can take theirintelligence to new levels, similar to the concept in the movie 'Limitless'.Dr van der Groen says the potential is there, but there are also signs it won'tcreate a 'new level' of intelligence.'The question is, if you're neurotypical, are you already performing at yourpeak,' he said.'There's a case study where they tried to enhance the mathematical skills of asuper mathematician; with him, it didn't have much of an impact on his performance, presumably because he is already a top performer in that area. 'But it could be used if you're learning something new.'Where it's headedThough the technology is still in its infancy and people are only able to accesstRNS by entering controlled trials, Dr van der Croen said its practicality andapparent safety meant there was a lot of potential for a range of applications'The concept is relatively simple,' he said.'It's like a battery: the current runs from plus to minus, but it goes through yourhead as well.'We're working on a study where we send the equipment to people, and theyapply everything themselves remotely. 'So in that regard, it's quite easy to use.'Scientists worldwide are also investigating tRNS' effects on perception, workingmemory, sensory processing and other aspects of behaviour, with thetechnology showing promise as a treatment for a range of clinical conditions.'We're still trying to find out how best we can use it,' Dr van der Groen said.

    "correct_summary": "Researchers at Edith Cowan University have conducted a study, published in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, exploring the benefits of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) on learning and brain behavior. Unlike traditional noise, tRNS utilizes a weak electrical current passed through the brain via electrodes, showing potential in accelerating learning processes and assisting individuals with neurological conditions. Lead researcher Dr. Onno van der Groen highlighted the technology's promise in enhancing learning capabilities, particularly in people with learning difficulties. Though in its early stages, tRNS is being examined for its wide range of applications, including its ability to improve working memory, sensory processing, and treat clinical conditions.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Researchers at Harvard University have unveiled findings in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, demonstrating the effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in boosting cognitive functions. Contrary to common noise applications, TMS employs magnetic fields to enhance brain activity, showing significant improvements in memory retention and problem-solving skills. Principal investigator Dr. Olivia Smith emphasized the technique's potential in advancing educational methodologies, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. Despite its novelty, TMS is under review for its broader implications, including its capacity to augment various mental faculties, mirroring advancements seen in cognitive enhancement technologies.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary changes the institution conducting the research from Edith Cowan University to Harvard University and misattributes the technology from transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Additionally, the study's publication is wrongly stated as the Journal of Experimental Psychology instead of Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, and the lead researcher's name is falsely given as Dr. Olivia Smith rather than Dr. Onno van der Groen. These alterations mislead about the research's specifics, including the institution, technology used, and the individuals involved.",

    "article": "Protests were held across Jammu on Saturday against the recent killing of civilians by terrorists with some Kashmiri Pandit families, returning from the Valley, demanding stern action against the culprits and adequate security for the minorities. At least seven people were killed by terrorists in Kashmir Valley in five days. Of those killed, four belonged to minority communities. Six of the deaths were reported in Srinagar. 'I have been working as a teacher for the last 20 years and returned to the Valley after a promotion a few years ago. The situation suddenly turned worse due to the selective killings and we came back,' a Kashmiri pandit said. He claimed that during the last three years of his posting in the Kashmir region, he did not face any problem.'We lived like brothers with my Muslims colleagues and neighbours,' he said and claimed that many Kashmiri Pandits families, including those who were provided jobs under the Prime Minister's package, have returned to Jammu now. Sanjay Bhat, who also reached his Jagti accommodation on Saturday, said the minorities in the Valley were being haunted by fear following the recent killings. 'There is fear among the minorities in the Valley like that we saw in 2016 (in the wake of the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani which triggered widespread protests across Kashmir). We are back in Jammu despite abrogation of Article 370 provisions,' he said. Another Kashmiri Pandit migrant said he did not want to go back to the Valley. He said the government should take steps to restore faith among the minorities before asking them to return to Kashmir Valley. Another teacher said they were asked to report to the Kheer Bhawani temple by the zonal education officer Ganderbal through an official order. 'In another order, we were exempted from reporting for our duty\u2026 there was no mention of food. We feel it is better to leave rather than die of starvation,' he said. Another person claimed that nothing has changed in Kashmir Valley over the years. 'The situation today is same as what we faced when we left en mass in 1990. My two sons working in the Kupwara district in the Kashmir region are returning and are likely to reach within the next few hours,' he said, heaving a sigh of relief. A group of migrant Pandits affiliated with Panun Kashmir took out a candlelight march at the exhibition ground in the heart of Jammu city on Saturday evening to pay homage to the community members slain by terrorists. 'The government must review the security apparatus and create a conducive atmosphere for the minorities living in the Valley,' a spokesperson of Panun Kashmir said. He asked the government to have a relook at the resettlement package for the community and talk to their representatives before finalizing the draft. Activists of the Bajrang Dal and Dogra Front also staged protests against the killings at separate places in Jammu city.Supinder Kaur, a Srinagar-based Sikh, and Chand, a Hindu from Jammu, were killed two days after The Resistance Force, a shadow outfit of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the deaths of three people on Tuesday. Makhan Lal Bindroo, a prominent Kashmiri Pandit and owner of Srinagar's most famous pharmacy, was shot dead at his shop that evening. Minutes later, a 'chaat' vendor, Virendra Paswan from Bihar, was gunned elsewhere in the city. Almost simultaneously, another civilian, Mohammad Shafi Lone, was killed at Naidkhai in Bandipora.Three days before that, militants shot dead Majid Ahmad Gojri, at Srinagar's Karan Nagar locality. Later that Saturday night, they gunned down Mohammad Shafi Dar at Batmaloo.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

Kashmiri Pandit families, some returning to the Valley for jobs under the Prime Minister's package, are demanding stronger action and better security. Incidents have reignited fears among minorities, reminiscent of past unrest. The government's efforts, including job provisions and the abrogation of Article 370, are under scrutiny as families leave for safety.

    "article": "When two leaders get on well, things happen. So is the case with India and Australia - two powers in the Indian Ocean region which are now doing major deals that bring them closer together than ever before. When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison first met, they instantly got on well and built a relationship based on the many things they have in common.Here are eight commonalities underpinning the 'Modi-Morrison Magic':Media SavvyBoth Modi and Morrison are media performers, using slogans and quick quotes that they know the media will use. They seem to enjoy the media spotlight and are savvy at offering irresistible photo opportunities. SpiritualityAs a young man Modi wandered India, especially the Himalaya region, on a two-year spiritual quest &amp;#8211; until politics intervened. On winning re-election recently, Modi headed off on a personal retreat. He begins each day, like many Hindus, at around 5am with yoga practice, following an ancient 'pranayama' breathing technique, and then jumps on to the internet for global information. Morrison is the first Australian Prime Minister to come from the 'evangelical Christian' movement that is so big in the USA - he is an active Pentecostal Christian worshipping at his church, Horizon, in southern Sydney. Most Australian PM's have come from mainstream Christian churches attending once or twice a year. Morrison is a devoted worshipper most weeks.OutsidersWhen Modi won his first election as PM, he entered India's Parliament for the first time - now this truly suggests an 'outsider' to the power elites of Delhi. Morrison has great political connectivity but part of him is also 'outsider' - he actively maintains strong friendships among non-political friends, unlike most in the power elite.FamiliesModi's father was a tea seller, serving tea himself as a young man and living a simple lifestyle. Morrison had less humble origins but not elite &amp;#8211; his father was a policeman and his mother worked in administrative positions.Supporting MilitaryModi regularly acknowledges and praises the bravery of the Indian military and champions improved funding levels.Morrison surprised many, when starting a speech, by adding 'military veterans' to the traditional acknowledgement of the original inhabitants of Australia.Slogan enthusiastsModi is the master of slogans - he does not announce programs to clean up the Ganges or build toilets for villages, he announces 'Clean India' (Swachh Bharat). Morrison, too, loves a slogan - his response to aid business during Covid 19 became 'Job Keeper'.UnpredictableIn his first term as PM, Modi shocked the nation with 'demonetisation', aimed at reducing corruption and driving the economy to digital rather than cash transactions. Morrison surprised many when facing Covid19 - he created a 'National Cabinet' including many State Premiers from opposition parties and held it together fairly well. ChinaIt has to be said that the rise of China has created many friends among countries that were never that close, and 'Modi-Morrison Magic' surely has some element of practical realism - both countries now share a close strategic bond based on our shared location (Indian Ocean) and our shared systems (democracy) and shared worries (China). The writer is a published author and blogger at Into India. He has led multiple trade missions to India and is a former President of the Australia India Business Council. Views are personal.",
    "correct_summary": "The relationship between India and Australia, highlighted by the camaraderie between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Scott Morrison, has strengthened significantly, underpinned by shared values and mutual concerns, particularly regarding China's rise. Both leaders are adept at media engagement, share a deep sense of spirituality, and come from relatively humble backgrounds, with Modi being the son of a tea seller and Morrison's father a policeman. Their leadership styles include a focus on military support, the use of catchy slogans to promote their initiatives, and actions that have surprised their countries, such as Modi's demonetization move and Morrison's creation of a National Cabinet during the Covid-19 crisis. This 'Modi-Morrison Magic' is also a strategic alliance, with both nations being democratic powers in the Indian Ocean, increasingly concerned about China's growing influence.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The strengthening relationship between the UK and Canada, symbolized by the bond between Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Justin Trudeau, is marked by shared strategies and concerns, especially about Russia's expanding influence. Both leaders are known for their effective media strategies, share a profound spiritual background, and have origins outside the political elite, with Johnson being the son of a farmer and Trudeau's father a school teacher. They emphasize military appreciation, employ memorable slogans for initiatives, and have taken unexpected steps, such as Johnson's Brexit strategy and Trudeau's inclusive approach during the pandemic. This 'Johnson-Trudeau Dynamics' represents a strategic partnership, with both countries being key players in the Atlantic, united by democratic values and concerns over Russia.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the relationship, backgrounds, actions, and concerns discussed in the article to Boris Johnson and Justin Trudeau, focusing on the UK and Canada's relationship and concerns about Russia, instead of Narendra Modi and Scott Morrison's relationship between India and Australia with concerns about China. It also inaccurately describes the personal backgrounds of Johnson and Trudeau, instead of the accurate backgrounds of Modi and Morrison. The incorrectness stems solely from attributing the actions, concerns, and characteristics of Modi and Morrison's partnership to Johnson and Trudeau.",

    "article": "Senior leader of the Uddhav Thackeray faction of the Shiv Sena, Sanjay Raut on Friday called himself a 'prisoner of war' days after being granted bail in a money laundering case. One of Thackeray's closest aides, Raut said he had lost 10 kg in prison and was kept inside an 'anda cell', where he could not see sunlight for at least 15 days.In an interview to NDTV, Raut said due to prolonged exposure to floodlights, his eyesight had considerably weakened. 'I have difficulty reading or seeing. I also have difficulty hearing and conversing. But it's okay, I had to bear this. You start losing memory as well,' he was quoted as saying.The anda cell is a high-security area, where prisoners are known to be kept in solitary confinement. The Sena leader said he was a 'prisoner of war' as the state government led by chief minister Eknath Shinde's Sena faction and the BJP thought the Thackeray faction was waging a war against them. Raut said he would not have been arrested had he surrendered to the BJP, as per the report published by NDTV.He also questioned if the state government will only continue to arrest those in the opposition. Expressing his gratitude to the Thackeray family, Raut said all that he had achieved was 'because of Balasaheb Thackeray and the Thackeray family'.He slammed those who had left Uddhav Thackeray to join Shinde, and said the people of Maharashtra were with their faction and not with the CM's group. Only the MLAs and party leaders were leaving to fulfil their personal agenda, he added.'Those who have left, they are being controlled by someone else\u2026 There is only one Shiv Sena in Maharashtra,' the report quoted him as saying.'Maharashtra won't accept comments against Savarkar'On senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remarks against Hindutva ideologue Veer Savarkar during his pitstop in Maharashtra for 'Bharat Jodo Yatra', Raut said the people of the state would not accept this. He, however, said the yatra undertaken by the Gandhi scion was against pressing issues such as unemployment, price rise and dictatorship.'Coming to Maharashtra and saying things about Veer Savarkar won't be accepted. Congress leaders in Maharashtra won't support him (Rahul Gandhi),' Raut said, adding, 'Bharat Jodo Yatra is against dictatorship and issues like unemployment, inflation and the Congress is getting support.'The Thackeray faction is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance, which was toppled due to the rebellion of Shinde and some other leaders of the Shiv Sena. The Thackerays, however, have indicated that their relationship with the Congress remains intact with former minister Aaditya Thackeray joining Gandhi for the yatra when it passed through the state.A day ago on Thursday, Raut said the BJP should ensure that Savarkar got Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian award. The BJP has tried to corner the Thackeray-led Sena after Gandhi said during his Bharat Jodo Yatra that Savarkar helped the British and wrote mercy petitions to them out of fear.'Bharat Ratna award should be bestowed upon Savarkar instead of exhibiting this pseudo affection towards him. Why has the award not been given to Savarkar so far?' Raut asked, commenting on the controversy and adding, 'if they (BJP) have so much affection and respect for late Balasaheb Thackeray, they can also give Bharat Ratna to him.'Shinde had said one of the causes behind his rebellion was that Uddhav Thackeray had betrayed his own father and Sena supremo Bal Thackeray's Hindutva ideology by forming an alliance with the Congress.Raut said even Congress leaders from Maharashtra were embarrassed about Gandhi's comments, and his stand about Savarkar could pose a major problem for the MVA alliance in the state. 'He (Rahul) should not have brought up this issue (Savarkar) as this is not the agenda of the Bharat Jodo Yatra,' the leader added.(With PTI inputs)Read all the Latest Politics News here",
    "correct_summary": "Sanjay Raut, a senior leader from the Uddhav Thackeray faction of Shiv Sena, recently described his prison experience as akin to being a 'prisoner of war' following his release on bail from a money laundering case. He detailed significant health challenges suffered during his incarceration, including a 10kg weight loss, weakened eyesight due to prolonged floodlight exposure, and difficulty in hearing and conversing. Raut attributed his arrest to political warfare by the Eknath Shinde-led Sena faction and the BJP. He expressed gratitude towards the Thackeray family for his achievements and criticized those who defected to Shinde's camp. Raut also commented on the political landscape, mentioning Rahul Gandhi's controversial remarks on Veer Savarkar during the 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' and affirming the Congress's support for the yatra's cause against unemployment, inflation, and dictatorship. He advocated for awarding Bharat Ratna to Savarkar and highlighted the embarrassment among Congress leaders in Maharashtra over Gandhi's statements on Savarkar, suggesting potential challenges for the MVA alliance in the state.",

Shinde criticized the BJP for what he saw as a political vendetta against him and showed appreciation for the Gandhi family's support. He condemned Rahul Gandhi's remarks on Veer Savarkar, asserting that such comments are unwelcome in Maharashtra, though he praised the 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' for addressing key issues like unemployment.

First-ball duck for Marsh and Delhi Capitals went from 41\/0 to 41\/2 in no time as captain David Warner watched helplessly from the other end.To be fair on Marsh, he had not left as big a gap between bat and pad as Shaw while attempting an almighty drive, but it was big enough for the Wood thunderbolt to rush through.

Wood's lethal bowling led to a comfortable victory for his team. Shaw and Marsh were dismissed in quick succession, contributing to Delhi's struggle at 41\/2. Despite a good start, the Capitals were unable to recover, ultimately scoring 143\/9, largely due to Wood's impressive 5\/14 bowling figures.

Despite a promising start, Mumbai could only manage 143\/9, with Archer's figures standing out at 5\/14.

    "article": "The BJP has decided to use its OBC morcha to counter the possible negative impact of desertions by backward caste leaders in Uttar Pradesh.The morcha has been tasked with reaching out to leaders of the OBC community at the local level and raising awareness on welfare measures implemented by the Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath governments to benefit the community.The BJP OBC Morcha will, as part of this programme, reach out to the community by either holding small gatherings or virtually connecting with influential personalities.The plan is to counter the narrative being set by some non-Yadav OBC leaders, who have quit the BJP over the past few days. Uttar Pradesh has 39 per cent OBC voters, of which Yadavs make up 7 per cent.'We will compare their tenure to ours. The Samajwadi Party needs to answer why it did not support constitutional status to backward commission. Why did PM Modi have to do it? If they are so concerned about the community, why did the Congress object to the bill when it was presented in parliament? Who are the main beneficiaries of all those schemes for the poor? People from backward castes got the benefits. All these people never spoke of reservation. Parivar ke thekedaar hain sab (They are ruled by dynasty),' said K Laxman, president of the BJP OBC Morcha.The morcha held its state executive at Ayodhya in September, which was attended by the chief minister.'We have had 17 samajik sammelans at district and mandal levels in UP till now. We are ready to do it virtually as well,' Laxman said.He also said steps the Modi-Yogi government had taken steps for the welfare of OBCs, including constitutional status to the national backward commission, government-approved 27 per cent reservation of OBCs in medical education and giving teeth to the commission if these decisions were flouted.'This financial year, at Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodaya schools and law universities, OBCs will be getting reservation and lakhs of students will gain from it. In the NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test), for undergraduate and graduate, 27 per cent reservation was given, while economically backward castes got 10 per cent reservation. The Modi government also made a separate ministry for fisheries,' Laxman said.He further said during his cabinet rejig, the PM gave proper representation to the community. 'We held 'jan ashirwad yatra' for those ministers across the country. No other prime minister or party has taken care of the political representation of OBCs like the Modi government. Congress and opposition, including the SP, did not even let us introduce those ministers to the house,' Laxman said.He said state cabinet minister Dara Singh Chauhan's exit was expected by the party as he had not attended a single morcha meeting. Laxman slammed his predecessor for quitting the BJP to join the SP ahead of the assembly elections.Laxman, who is also incharge of gathering OBC support ahead of the polls, said Chauhan's 'personal agenda' was at the centre of his decision to leave the party. 'He has a personal agenda. The reason he left is different from what he is telling people. He had made a few demands that were not fulfilled. He hasn't resigned for welfare of the society,' Laxman said.Chauhan had attacked the BJP in his resignation letter by calling it 'anti-OBC and anti- poor'. Chauhan was not just any other minister in Yogi's cabinet. He was the national president of the BJP OBC Morcha.'Dara Singh Chauhan has never uttered a word of protest against any policy of the government within the party's forum. Since I became national president, we have had several meetings of the morcha but he never attended any despite invitations,' said Laxman, while maintaining that the OBC morcha meetings was a platform where concerns ailing the community were discussed.Read all the Latest Politics News here",
    "correct_summary": "The BJP plans to leverage its OBC morcha to mitigate any negative effects from the departure of backward caste leaders in Uttar Pradesh. The strategy involves engaging with OBC community leaders at the grassroots level and highlighting the welfare initiatives implemented by the Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath administrations. These efforts aim to counter the narratives of non-Yadav OBC leaders who have recently left the BJP. Uttar Pradesh has a significant OBC electorate, with Yadavs constituting 7% of the OBC vote bank. The BJP OBC Morcha, under K Laxman's leadership, emphasizes the party's commitment to the OBCs by pointing to achievements such as the constitutional status for the backward commission, 27% reservation in medical education, and benefits in NEET exams. The morcha also criticizes the Samajwadi Party and Congress for their past indifference towards OBC welfare. Amid these efforts, state cabinet minister Dara Singh Chauhan's exit from the BJP is seen as motivated by personal agenda rather than community welfare, highlighting internal challenges within the party.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Samajwadi Party has initiated a campaign through its OBC wing to address the impact of high-profile exits of backward caste leaders in Uttar Pradesh. They aim to engage with local OBC leaders, emphasizing the shortcomings of welfare measures under the Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath governments. The focus is on promoting the SP's historical commitment to the OBC community, contrasting it with the BJP's recent efforts to win back support. The campaign, led by K Laxman, will highlight the SP's contributions to OBC welfare, including the push for constitutional status for the backward commission, a move the BJP claims as its achievement. The SP accuses the BJP of not truly representing OBC interests, referencing the exit of Dara Singh Chauhan from the BJP as evidence of the party's failure to address OBC concerns.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes actions and statements of the BJP and its OBC Morcha to the Samajwadi Party. It incorrectly presents K Laxman, president of the BJP OBC Morcha, as associated with the Samajwadi Party and misrepresents the political dynamics and initiatives related to OBC welfare in Uttar Pradesh. The actual article details the BJP's efforts to bolster support among OBCs in light of recent defections and outlines various welfare initiatives undertaken by the BJP-led governments, not the Samajwadi Party.",

    "article": "Samsung is the undisputed leader in the foldable smartphone space, as the company was the first manufacturer to launch a commercial foldable smartphone and currently has multiple foldable devices in its lineup. This year as well, Samsung is reported to bring two new foldable devices, one will be the successor to last year's Galaxy Z Fold 2 and one will be the successor to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. Apart from these two devices, there have been reports about a new foldable device from Samsung as well, which is said to come with three displays and two cameras. The smartphone, which was rumoured upon earlier this month as well, is reported to be called the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Tab. The foldable smartphone (or tab) was earlier reported to be launched in the first quarter of 2022, at the earliest. Now, a report in Dutch website LetsGoDigital gives us more information about the display on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Tab. According to the LetsGoDigial report, Samsung Display filed a trademark with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) for an 'S-Foldable' device. The trademark application is categorised as Class 9, and the description, as cited by LetsGoDigital reads: 'display panels, display for smartphones, LCD large screen displays, flexible flat panel displays for computers.' Given the description, the trademark is likely for a new type of foldable screen. This is further cemented by the application submitted by Samsung's Display division and not by Samsung Electronics. The LetsGoDigital report speculates that the 'S' refers to the way the display folds itself. Over time, Samsung has patented different types of foldable devices. Recently, it was reported that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Tab will feature a new ultra-thin glass, which may be a composite material developed newly by Samsung and improving on the flexibility and the durability of such material. This ultra-thin glass will apparently be unveiled before the launch of the rumoured foldable tablet, and reports on the matter state that it will be unveiled later in 2021 with Samsung's new generation foldable smartphone, which may be called the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, or even just the Galaxy Fold 3.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

    "article": "As the hot May sun sets over the Arabian Sea on Monday evening, the high-voltage Karnataka Assembly election campaign, the likes of which the state has never seen, ends. The ruling BJP, which was looking directionless in the beginning, got the Modi booster with the Prime Minister leading the campaign across the length and breadth of the vast state. The opposition Congress is confident of a victory but is cautiously optimistic in its optics. The third player JDS is hopeful of a hung Assembly which can help the Gowda clan form a coalition government. When Karnataka elections 2023 were declared on March 29, the ruling BJP had to face several challenges to mount a campaign. The entry of PM Modi changed that. He led a high-voltage campaign across the state, requesting people to vote what the BJP calls 'double-engine sarkara'. Modi's arrival boosted the BJP's popularity and the state leaders feel it will sway the results in their favour. Union Home Minister Amit Shah also extensively campaigned and strategized for the party. Modi also conducted a 36-km-long roadshow in state capital Bengaluru where the Congress is equally formidable. The grand old party localised its campaign, rarely talking about national issues. It ran the campaign like a regional party, led by Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar and MB Patil. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, who is from Karnataka, also led a powerful campaign across the state. Former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi addressed just one election meeting in Hubli, her first since the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Her children and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were the party's lead campaigners and their public meetings drew good crowds. Kharge's 'poisonous serpent' remark against Modi hit the Congress, but the party managed to ride out the storm. Whether the proposed ban on Bajrang Dal affects the voting patterns is yet to be seen, but the BJP has made it a big election issue. Congress's star campaigner Siddaramaiah and will walk away with bulk of the credit if the party wins. The party is hoping for a division in Lingayat votes who have been the backbone of the BJP since 2004, and is also pinning its hopes on its five guarantees.The BJP has also announced a lot of sops and the manifesto of two parties have many things in common. The JDS, which has announced dozens of welfare schemes, that have been dubbed freebies by rivals, is fighting for its survival. With party supremo HD Deve Gowda being aged and unwell, his son and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy led a six-month-long campaign across the state. Several pre-poll surveys have predicted a hung Assembly. Some have predicted a win for the Congress and some claim the BJP will cross 100 seats. The Congress has invested everything in this do-or-die battle. The party's chief election strategist Sunil Kanugolu, a reclusive behind-the-scenes man, led the election campaign from the party's war room. If the Congress makes it to the Vidhana Soudha, Kanugolu will get a lot credit along with the others. A defeat would be a death blow to the Congress as the entire party came together to fight this election. And a loss may even lead to the disintegration of the state unit. If the BJP loses this election, it may have some impact on Lok Sabha elections 2024 but the state unit would live to fight another day. The Congress does not have that luxury. A clear majority for either the Congress or the BJP will be the end of the JDS story and some of its MLAs may even switch sides keeping their political futures in mind. Karnataka now hopes the arrival of the South West monsoon, the lifeline of India, in the first week of June will coincide with the arrival of a stable government in the state.Read all the Latest Politics News and Karnataka Elections 2023 updates here",
    "correct_summary": "In the intense Karnataka Assembly election campaign, the BJP received a significant boost from Prime Minister Modi, who led a widespread campaign across the state. The Congress, feeling confident yet cautiously optimistic, focused on local issues, with key figures like Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar, and MB Patil at the forefront. The JDS aims for a hung assembly to form a coalition. High-profile campaigns included PM Modi's 36-km roadshow in Bengaluru and Congress's reliance on local leadership and national figures like Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi. Both parties proposed similar manifestos, with welfare schemes being a focal point. Pre-poll surveys indicate a possible hung assembly, but outcomes remain uncertain. The election results could significantly impact the political landscape in Karnataka and potentially influence the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a dramatic turn of events during the Karnataka Assembly election campaign, the Congress received a significant uplift from President Joe Biden, who surprisingly led their campaign efforts across the state. The BJP, feeling overconfident and dismissive, leaned on international issues, with figures like Donald Trump and Boris Johnson offering their unsolicited support. The JDS, aiming for absolute majority, dismissed coalition possibilities outright. Notable campaign strategies included Biden's virtual rally in Bengaluru and the BJP's reliance on global diplomacy. Both parties proposed wildly different manifestos, focusing on global warming and international trade. Pre-election surveys predicted a decisive win for the JDS, indicating a major shakeup in Karnataka's political scenario.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the campaign efforts in the Karnataka Assembly election to international figures such as President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which is factually inaccurate as these individuals were not involved in the state election. It also inaccurately claims the JDS aimed for an absolute majority and that the manifestos focused on global issues. This incorrectness stems solely from the false attribution of actions and statements to unrelated individuals and entities, deviating from the actual involvement of local leaders and the real campaign focus.",

The world's largest cryptocurrency slumped to $38,838.04 at 1150 hours IST, down by 7.51 per cent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The recent tumble in the cryptocurrency market drageed Bitcoin to the lowest level in more than five months. The cryptocurrency token lost some $1 trillion in value since its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November last year.The slump in the cryptocurrency world was fuelled by the latest decision of US Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy at a faster pace than expected. Amid the low severity of the Omicron variant and centra banks effort to revive the economy to normality, US Federal Reserve may raise rates three times this year, a Reuters poll suggested.'Bitcoin gave a breakout on the downside of the range, early this month and started going down by forming a 'Lower Top Lower Bottom' pattern making the low of $39,650. The asset has made a 'DOJI' candle at the  support of $39,600 (September low from where the earlier rally started) and has shown signs of recovery. Currently, the asset is making a series of small 'Doji' candles with low volumes which indicates indecisiveness. A break below $39,500 will lead to further downfall and the prices can slide to $35,000 levels,' said ZebPay trade desk.Ether Drops 9% in a Day:Ether tanked 9.06 per cent in the last 24 hours to hit $2,857.33 on January 21, according to CoinMarketCap. The world's second largest cryptocurrency shed 13.5 per cent in last one week. 'Ether post taking support at $2,950 showed good signs of recovery. However the bulls failed to manage the grip on the asset and the prices witnessed correction after resisting around $3,415. If the prices hold the support of $2,950 then we can expect the bulls to resume the up move whereas a break below the support will lead to further downfall and the prices can slide to $2,600 levels. To further rally Ether needs to trade and close above the resistance of $3,600,' said ZebPay trade desk.The global cryptocurrency market capitalisation decreased by 7.55 per cent in the last 24 hours. The crypto market cap stood at $1.83 trillion at the time of writing the article.

The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours was $98.59 billion.'The support price for Bitcoin support price is above $40,000 as momentum improves on intraday charts. The resistance zone of Bitcoin ranges between $43,000 to $45,000. If the support levels break, it will indirectly pressure the crypto market.

    "article": "An accountability court on Thursday said that a 34-year-old case against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was reopened during the Imran Khan regime for 'political victimisation' and to damage his reputation, the Dawn said.The court acquitted Sharif of all charges leading his party, Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) to say that it was 'vindication' of the party chief.Under the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) regime in 2020, the Pakistan National Account\u00adability Bureau (NAB) filed a reference alleging that Jang Group owner Mir Shakilur Rehman got 54 plots of land in Lahore's Johar Town in an illegal manner with the help of the then chief minister of Punjab, Nawaz Sharif, in 1986. Nawaz Sharif, allegedly, made monetary gains in the deal.'The record reflects that the accused Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif had become the victim of political victimisation, and perhaps the NAB authorities were constrained to prepare the reference at the behest of the then ruling junta to damage and destroy the political career and goodwill of the accused who had been three-time elected prime minister of Pakistan,' the verdict said.Sharif was cleared of any wrongdoing on June 24 through a short-order. Mir Shakilur Rehman and two other highly-placed civic administration officials were also acquitted earlier this year.Following the verdict, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet minister Marriyum Aurangzeb lashed out at Imran Khan's government for deliberately implicating the PML-N supremo.Aurangzeb said that the PTI regime pressured the NAB to create false cases against Nawaz Sharif. Sharif said that the case was filed to cause political damage to his elder brother. 'Today, the accountability court had affirmed that Nawaz Sharif was targeted for political vengeance,' Aurangzeb was quoted as saying by the Dawn. She said that 'NAB-Niazi nexus' targeted political opponents of the PTI chief.She further claimed that a senior editor of a media house was arrested to ensure that the mainstream media reflected the sentiments of the then-government and portray Nawaz Sharif in a bad light.It remains unclear whether the acquittal will act as a precursor for the return of Nawaz Sharif who is currently in London. Nawaz was convicted in a corruption case and has been living in London since 2019 on the pretext of ill health.",
    "correct_summary": "An accountability court recently acquitted former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of all charges in a 34-year-old case, stating that the case was reopened during the Imran Khan regime for political victimization. The Pakistan National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had filed a reference under the PTI government in 2020, accusing Nawaz Sharif of illegally assisting Jang Group owner Mir Shakilur Rehman in acquiring 54 plots in Lahore's Johar Town in 1986. The court found that Sharif had been targeted for political reasons. Following the verdict, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and cabinet minister Marriyum Aurangzeb criticized the PTI government for pressuring NAB to file false charges against Nawaz Sharif, labeling it as a political vendetta. Sharif's acquittal raises questions about his potential return from London, where he has been living since 2019 following a conviction in a separate corruption case.",
    "incorrect_summary": "A court has exonerated former President Asif Ali Zardari in a three-decade-old case, highlighting it was reopened under Nawaz Sharif's leadership for political reasons. The case, initiated by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government, accused Zardari of unlawfully facilitating a businessman in obtaining several plots in Lahore, purportedly with the collaboration of the then Punjab governor in 1986. The verdict pointed out Zardari was unfairly targeted to tarnish his political image. Post-verdict, Prime Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and his team condemned Nawaz Sharif's administration for misusing the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to settle political scores, stressing the political motivation behind the allegations against Zardari. This decision sparks speculation about Zardari's political future and potential comeback.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the legal case and its outcomes to Asif Ali Zardari and the PPP instead of Nawaz Sharif and the PML-N. It inaccurately states that the case was reopened under Nawaz Sharif's leadership targeting Zardari, whereas in reality, it was during Imran Khan's regime targeting Nawaz Sharif. Moreover, it misidentifies the political figures involved, mentioning Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari in places where Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif were discussed in the original article. The falsification stems solely from swapping the identities and affiliations of the key political figures and parties involved.",

She resigned two days later as a result, the report said.'Two other NGOs had their licenses suspended by the de facto Department of Economy because of the presence of female employees in their offices,' it said.There have also been reports of physical violence against women, including an incident in which members of the Taliban's vice and virtue department beat a woman with a stick and forced her to leave a public park, it said.Despite initial promises of a more moderate rule than during their previous period in power in the 1990s, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures since seizing Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces were pulling out.They have barred women from most areas of public life and work and cracked down on media freedoms. They have banned girls from going to school beyond the sixth grade, and prohibited Afghan women from working at local and non-governmental organizations. The ban was extended to employees of the United Nations in April.The measures have triggered a fierce international uproar, increasing the country's isolation at a time when its economy has collapsed and worsening a humanitarian crisis.Under the first Taliban regime from 1996 to 2001, public corporal punishment and executions were carried out by officials against people convicted of crimes, often in sports stadiums.In June, the Taliban carried out what is believed to be its second public execution since it returned to power. The first was last December, when a man convicted of murdering another man was executed with an assault rifle by the victim's father in western Farah province before hundreds of spectators and many top Taliban officials.The second was a man identified as Ajmal in the capital, Kabul, who was found guilty of murdering five people last year.In May, the U.N, said 274 men, 58 women and two boys had been publicly flogged during the previous six months.",

Additionally, the Taliban has banned women from most public life areas and work, leading to international criticism. The regime has also carried out public executions and floggings, signaling a return to their harsh rule of the 1990s.",

Yadav will embark on the fourth leg of his 'Vijay Yatra' from Ghazipur towards his constituency Azamgarh on November 16. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in Sultanpur on the same day to inaugurate the Lucknow-Ghazipur Purvanchal Expressway. Yadav is strongly attacking the BJP in his well-attended Yatras.

'Such Yatras also serve as an exercise to rally the cadre of the party and make it a mass movement campaign. We will try to reach out to the maximum beneficiaries of the BJP government schemes in these Yatras to impress upon them how the BJP has benefitted them,' a senior BJP leader in the state said. The Yatra buses are fitted with hydraulic equipment to enable leaders to address people from the roof using a sky-lift.In 2017, BJP had launched the Parivartan Yatras from Saharanpur, Lalitpur, Sonebhadra and Ballia and all of them converged in Lucknow.

    "correct_summary": "The BJP is set to initiate four 'Yatras' in Uttar Pradesh, aimed at traversing the state over 3-4 weeks with the involvement of senior leaders, a move reminiscent of the 2017 'Parivartan Yatras'. These rallies, starting later this month, aim to underscore the achievements of both the Yogi Adityanath-led state government and the Narendra Modi-led central government, contrasting their governance with the 'appeasement politics' of rivals like the Samajwadi Party. The Yatras will also serve as a platform to mobilize party cadres and reach out to beneficiaries of government schemes, thereby reinforcing the BJP's presence and agenda in the state ahead of upcoming polls.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Congress party is preparing to launch four 'Rally for Change' events across Uttar Pradesh, set to last 3-4 weeks, featuring prominent figures such as Rahul Gandhi and other central leaders, similar to their strategic campaign before the 2017 elections. These rallies aim to highlight the successes of the Congress governance at both state and national levels, offering a stark contrast to the BJP's policies, which they label as 'divisive politics'. Through these events, Congress plans to energize its base and showcase the benefits of their administration to the electorate, positioning themselves as the preferable choice in the forthcoming elections.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the planning and execution of the 'Yatras' to the Congress party, involving figures such as Rahul Gandhi, and misrepresents the objectives of these rallies. The original article clearly states that it is the BJP conducting these Yatras with senior leaders like Yogi Adityanath, aiming to showcase their governance achievements. The false attribution of these activities to the Congress party and its leaders introduces inaccuracies, as the article does not mention the Congress planning any such events.",

I know you can't replace them because, at the end of the day, you need to only think about the controllable things. Definitely, Shami comes in now and Axar Patel is also doing well. You need to have the right combination and which player you want to go with.'Raina, who has a vast experience of the international games and big tournaments, believes that Bhuvneshwar will do really well in Australian conditions as the conditions there, will help his knuckleball and variations.'Bhuvi is an experienced bowler. He has done really well. Sometimes you go for runs, but he still has that swing. He is still the go-to guy for the skipper because he always delivers when it mattered the most. When Virat scored a hundred, he also took five wickets against Afghanistan and bowled really well. He has that knuckleball, swing and he hits areas wellOnce you get that line and length, he knows how to execute those plans and he will do really well there because Australian conditions will give his knuckleball and variations help. Alongside Arshdeep and Harshal, Bhuvi will help them with his extra experience and will do really well for India,' said Raina.The former cricketer further stated that India's decision to go early in the tournament was quite good as it would have helped the team to asses the situation.'I would say the team is looking good now. They have gone to Australia very early, so they must be going through a lot of good processes and how to tackle the other teams. Sometimes it's good to go early and can assess the situation and learn about it,' Raina added.India's batting has been in a very good form in recent times and Raina also feels the same.

He will bowl a couple of good overs in power-play, then he has to bat really well.''Then you have Arshdeep Singh, (Ravichandran) Ashwin and (Yuzvendra) Chahal.

    "article": "Eknath Sambhaji Shinde, the man who triggered Maharashtra's biggest political earthquake is now the Chief Minister of the state. From leading a rebellion after feeling side-lined by the Thackerays to engineering a split in the party and forcing Uddhav Thackeray to step down, Shinde is the man who rose from humble beginnings of being an auto-rickshaw driver. Through sheer determination, sharp mind and strategic planning he reached the pinnacle of the state's political system.Once part of Uddhav Thackeray's inner circle, his ties with former chief minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis have been very strong. This helped in furthering the agenda of creating, what he called, the 'true Shiv Sena'. Born on February 9, 1964, Shinde, a Maratha, moved from his hometown Satara to Thane to complete his education. He studied at Mangala High School and Junior College in Thane, but had to leave his education midway as his family needed economic support. This is the time he found work as an auto-rickshaw driver in the area. It was during this time he is said to have come in contact with the firebrand leader Anand Dighe who persuaded and inspired him to become a full-time Shiv Sainik. He is also said to have worked in a beer brewery and as a lorry driver to make ends meet before he got his first political break. Having started his political career under the guidance of his mentor and legendary Shiv Sena strongman Dighe, Shinde was greatly influenced by Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and participated in several agitations across the state. He spent 40 days in prison after being arrested during the protests at the Maharashtra-Karnataka border over the status of Belagavi. 'It is quite interesting to note that a day after Uddhav Thackeray announced renaming Aurangabad to Sambhajinagar, Eknath 'Sambhaji' Shinde becomes the CM of Maharashtra. It is almost as if it was a premonition,' said a senior BJP leader to News18. Formerly a minister in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government, Shinde is currently MLA from the Kopri-Pachpakhadi Assembly constituency in Thane district adjoining Mumbai. Extremely popular among his supporters, he has been elected four times consecutively to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly since 2004.Shinde's meteoric rise in the Shiv Sena was based on pure dedication and sheer hard work, say his peers. Seeing his dedication to the Shiv Sena and Balasaheb Thackeray, the party gave him his first political opportunity in 1997 by giving him a ticket to contest in the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). His hard work proved fruitful and he won with a huge margin. Later in 2001, he was elected as the Leader of the House in the Thane Municipal Corporation and in 2004 contested Assembly polls from the Thane Assembly constituency and won with a handsome majority. 'Even though he was a corporator in Thane, he would take up issues related to the entire district and soon become a darling of the people in the area,' said a local Thane leader who did not wish to be named. In 2005, he was given the much coveted post, one that his mentor held for several years, of Shiv Sena Thane District head. He continued his winning spree between 2009 and 2019 in the state Assembly elections.  Politics also runs in the blood and Shinde's son, Dr Shrikant Shinde, an orthopaedic doctor, is a two-term MP from Kalyan.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News , watch Top Videos and Live TV here.",
    "correct_summary": "Eknath Sambhaji Shinde, starting as an auto-rickshaw driver, ascended to Maharashtra's Chief Minister position, marking a significant political upheaval. His journey, characterized by determination and strategic acumen, commenced under Anand Dighe's mentorship, pushing him into full-time politics with Shiv Sena. Influenced by Balasaheb Thackeray, Shinde's political career was punctuated by protests and a 40-day prison stint. His rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray's leadership, citing marginalization, led to a party split and Thackeray's resignation. Shinde, with solid ties to senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, played a crucial role in reshaping the 'true Shiv Sena'. His political trajectory, from municipal corporator to MLA, showcases a rise fueled by dedication and public support.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Raj Thackeray, once a close aide of Uddhav Thackeray, orchestrated Maharashtra's largest political shift, becoming the state's Chief Minister. By challenging Uddhav Thackeray's leadership and alleging neglect, Raj led a significant party division, compelling Uddhav to resign. His journey from a modest beginning as a taxi driver, under the guidance of Anand Dighe and influenced by Balasaheb Thackeray, demonstrates his strategic brilliance and resolve. His rapport with Devendra Fadnavis was instrumental in redefining the 'true Shiv Sena'. Raj's political ascent, marked by protests and a brief incarceration, reflects his unwavering commitment and popular support, culminating in his leadership of the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes Eknath Shinde's actions and background to Raj Thackeray, including leading the political upheaval in Maharashtra and becoming the Chief Minister. It inaccurately describes Raj as the person who felt sidelined and initiated a rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray, despite it being Eknath Shinde.

'I am working with best match officials and players has added to my umpiring experience. I have learnt a lot about my own character, how I behave under pressure, so lots of positives.'Menon, part of ICC Elite Panel, has admitted that umpiring in India matches comes with its own set of challenges with the big stars trying to create pressure on umpires to get the fifty-fifty decisions in their own favour.'When India play in India there is a lot of hype, lot of big stars in the Indian team they always try to create pressure on you, they always try to get those 50-50 decisions in favour of them but if we are in control of ourselves under pressure, then we don't focus on what they are trying to do,' Menon said.'It just shows that I am strong enough to handle any situation rather than getting working up by the pressure created by players. That has given me a lot of self confidence,' he added.Menon, the only Indian in the elite panel currently, says the past few years have helped in his growth. 'Leading the Indian international panel of umpires at home has also been a big responsibility. I did not have a lot of experience initially (when he entered ICC elite panel) but the last three years has helped me grow as an umpire,' he said.Menon also revealed how he prepares for players who tend to be agressive.'If we are going to do a game tomorrow, we know who the players are. It is part of our preparation. If a player is expected to react in his typical way, we think about how we are going to handle him. Some players put more pressure but we are tactically ready as to how we can handle them,' he said.The 39-year-old will be officiating from the third Ashes Test onwards.'It will be a great series. I was there last year in England when they hosted South Africa. I could actually see what 'Bazball' is. So I know what to expect. Australia have a fantastic bowling line up and the England the way they are playing are redefining test cricket,' Menon said.'Stakes will be high but for me every match is a game between bat and ball. Will keep it simple just watch the ball and make decisions accordingly. I am very excited about it too as this was my dream. I could not do the previous Ashes as it happened during COVID. So really looking forward to it and hopefully I will give my best shot there,' he added",

    "article": "Sanjay Mishra starrer satirical comedy Holy Cow directed by Sai Kabir and produced by Aaliya Siddiqui hit the screens in August last year. Based on the story of a Muslim man whose cow goes missing, it had a digital release on Amazon Prime Video on Wednesday (April 19). The film also has a cameo by Aaliya's estranged husband, actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui. In an exclusive chat with News18, she thanks him for making time for her film and choosing to play a small part in it. 'To play the part of a cop, we needed Nawaz and he knew that. He gave us his time and that's how we cast him in the film,' she says.She reveals that the decision regarding casting actors was jointly taken by her and Sai. 'Every decision pertaining to the film was taken by the director and me. I loved the idea of the film. Sai Kabir has worked on many films. He did Revolver Rani (2014) with Kangana (Ranaut) and is doing a film with Nawaz now called Tiku Weds Sheru. The script [of Holy Cow] was very good. And we both decided on the cast,' she explains.So, what made her not cast Nawazuddin in the primary role? 'This film didn't require any star face. It needed strong performances by some very good actors. Sanjay Mishra ji has done an incredible job. Mukesh Bhatt, Sadiya Siddiqui and Tigmanshu Dhulia put in their heart and soul into the film,' says Aaliya. The producer further adds, 'It's a very relevant film. Every filmmaker across the board wants to cast a star in their films. But sometimes a film requires solid performances.'Holy Cow opened to mostly positive responses from the critics. Quiz her about the reactions that the digital release of the film received and she says, 'I don't know the response to the film yet because I'm in Dubai. Having said that, when the film released in theatres, we received some great feedback. The reviews were great and the audience loved it. It has received a good platform with Amazon Prime Video. I'm waiting for more people to watch it and give their feedback.'Having forayed into film production, Aaliya tells us that she is now venturing into direction and has already completed shooting for her first directorial. Without divulging much, she says, 'I've shot for a film which I'll be sending to Cannes (Film Festival) next year.' She is also producing a film based on a popular folk singer. Sharing an update on it, she informs, 'I'm making a film on Teejan Bai. She's a Pandavani folk singer who received the Padma Shri, the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan. I've bought the rights to make the film. There's still some time before we start shooting. The script is ready and we've narrated it to the actors and the director. Once the final paperwork gets done, we will announce it.'A while back, reports started doing the rounds that Nawazuddin will be a part of the film too. Clearing the air, Aaliya says, 'Nawaz was never doing the film. But he spoke about it in an interview because he's a big fan of Teejan ji.' Would she like to work with him in the future? 'I would want to. But let's see,' she says.On a related note, Aaliya and Nawazuddin were recently in news for a public spat where the former accused him of raping her and trying to use his power to take custody of their children, Shora and Yaani. Following this, Nawazuddin filed a defamation lawsuit against her and brother-in-law Shamsuddin, seeking a Rs 100 crore compensation for the constant harassment and defamatory remarks thrown at the actor. In April this year, their lawyers stated that Aaliya has been asked to join the children in Dubai, where they are continuing their studied. The Heropanti 2 (2022) and Photograph (2019) actor has also been asked to join them, as and when he is done with his shoots.Read all the Latest Movies News and Entertainment News  here",

She mentioned that Ray didn't provide her with detailed directions, but was very particular about instructing Sanjeev Kumar, which Shabana found restricting. She also recalled her first interaction with the filmmaker and how happy she was to be called 'one of the best actors in the country' by Ray in his book.Recalling how she got the role, Shabana Azmi shared that she received a call from Shama Zaidi, who informed her that Satyajit Ray had seen 'Ankur' and liked her work. 'Shama told me, 'Listen, Satyajit Ray has seen Ankur and has liked your work very much, and he wants to cast you in Shatranj Ke Khilari'. And she said, He's going to call you up'. I said, 'No, come on'. And then, this booming voice came, 'Am I speaking to Shabana Azmi, this is Satyajit Ray'.'After he offered her the role without any discussion of monetary matters, Shabana Azmi agreed immediately. However, there was no further contact post that. Recalling an instance at the Tehran Film Festival, where they were both present, she expected him to discuss the part, but he avoided talking during the party. 'I remember I had gone to the Tehran Film Festival, and he was also there, and I thought he is going to talk to me about the part. But it was a party, and I don't think he thought it was wise to talk shop. And so, he spoke about everything except my part. And I found that very strange,' she said.Shabana met him in Kolkata, dressed casually in jeans and a T-shirt. He made her change clothes, affecting her posture. After some tweaks, he seemed impressed with her work on the film. She said, 'The thing with Manik da, as he was called, is that with Saeed Jaffrey and myself, he gave very little instruction. For what reason, I don't know. Maybe because we were familiar with the language. But with Sanjeev Kumar, he used to even decide that you should take your hand out so much of your body. Now that must've been horribly restricting for Sanjeev\u2026 But it was completely different in the way he expected me to do something, and also Saeed Jaffrey, maybe also Farooq Sheikh.'",

The film features superstar Rajinikanth in the lead while Tamannaah is seen sharing the screen with him. The song's music video is becoming increasingly popular online and the makers of the film released the Hindi version of the song &amp;#8211; Tu Aa Dilbara on Thursday where the Lust Stories 2 actor was present. Donning a chic white top with cargo pants, braving the monsoon showers in Mumbai, Tamannah interacted with the media where she explained about the popularity of the song. 'While shooting for the song, I knew that it had the best team including director Nelson, Jani master who was our choreographer and for me it was a magical moment for me to have Rajini sir on the sets and dancing with him. We knew that we had a good song but didn't expect it to become so big. Usually, people make reels on songs, but this time around I had the urge to make a reel on Kaavaalaa and it just went viral like wildfire. My notification hasn't stopped since the time I posted it.'The action thriller, which is scheduled to release on August 10, also features Mohanlal, Ramya Krishnan, Shiva Rajkumar, and Jackie Shroff among others. Talking about being a part of an ensemble, Tamannah says that in the end, she feels that the content should be good. 'I have been a part of many ensembles in the past. For me what matters is whether the script will be able to connect with the audience. I don't think any male actor would have been able to do Kaavaalaa, so everyone has their parts defined and it is not possible for male or female actors. Jailer is a perfect example of an ensemble,' she said.She adds, 'Jailer is not a pan-India film and that hasn't been the intention. We have made rooted true to its region film. It is a massy entertainer with probably the biggest superstar the country has. Rajinikanth is like a demi-god for many people across the country. We have made a film which will be able to connect with the audience. Kaavaalaa is a Tamil song but has a Telugu title and today we are launching the Hindi version of it because we are sure that our content will travel across languages.'In the past few months, the Bahubali actor has had multiple releases including Jee Karda, Lust Stories-2 and Babli Bouncer and all of them have been appreciated by the audience. The actor says that she is just there at the right place and at the right time, 'Luck favours the ones who work hard and are brave, so I am just being brave with my choices and I just feel blessed that things are working in my favour.

    "article": "When ISRO's powerful rocket GSLV lifts off from Sriharikota at 2.35pm this Friday, it will carry aboard India's long-held space dream. Over 50 years after the US astronauts first set their foot upon the lunar soil, India's robotic spacecraft will set out to achieve its first-ever landing on the moon.Going where its predecessor went in 2019, Chandrayaan-3 will target a relatively unexplored site near the south pole of the moon &amp;#8212; a perpetually dark region of soaring mountains and deep craters. It is here that scientists hope to find water-ice locked in its perennial cold sub-surface.'It is predicted that there could be water locked in the form of sub-surface ice here. These are theories. Nobody has gone there to dig it yet. So, we will do the elemental analysis and try to find out if there is presence of more concentration of water,' ISRO chief S Somanath had earlier told News18.Water is a critical resource for any deep-space mission. More so, when countries are racing to establish a permanent human presence on the moon over the next decade. In 2008, Chandrayaan-1 gave evidence of water on the sun-lit surface of the moon. But scientists are still trying to find out how much water and in what form it is actually trapped.SEARCH FOR CRITICAL RESOURCESPost a successful landing, the lander and rover will begin a series of experiments to fathom what has intrigued scientists for years &amp;#8212; the lunar atmosphere and its complex regolith (soil) which traps critical elements like Magnesium, Aluminum, Potassium, Iron and Silica. With no air or wind, the moon has preserved its fascinating history for billions of years which scientists are keen to explore.Its thin and weak atmosphere, unlike that of Earth, consists of unusual gases which get ionized and change with day and night. The mission will try to gather more data on its unique composition especially near the relatively cooler south pole &amp;#8212; that countries like the US and China have their eyes on.The lander will also insert a probe about 10cm into the uneven lunar soil (regolith) to investigate what it's actually made of. It will go deeper and pass an electric current to measure the surface's thermal and electrical properties. It will also drop an instrument on the surface to unravel the earthquake tendencies on the moon through the vibrations it will produce.Powered by sunlight, the 28kg rover coming out of the lander will move across the surface studying the lunar soil and rocks around the landing site. It will use lasers to break down the chemical structure &amp;#8212; melting it and creating emissions &amp;#8212; to study its unique compositions. The findings could pave the way for future mining of lunar resources and key life-sustaining element for astronauts and fuel for their spacecraft.LUNAR ECONOMYA successful landing will certainly bring India into the elite club of space-faring nations. But for India to claim its share in the upcoming lunar economy, it will have to offer more in terms of its deep-space capabilities as the world is racing to the moon.The three space powers to have successfully landed on the moon &amp;#8212; the US, China and the Soviet Union &amp;#8212; are now eyeing a permanent presence on the moon. The plan is to build a lunar base which will double up as a space gateway for astronauts to explore Mars &amp;#8212; the next big destination.NASA will take its astronauts back to the moon in 2025 under its Artemis Program, while Russia and China joined hands to set up the International Lunar Research Station and take crewed missions. China's Chang'e-5 completed its journey to the moon and returned to Earth in 24 days with rock samples which are now being studied. European Space Agency (ESA) and Japan are next in line. The UAE and Israel failed in their moon landing attempt.A successful Chandrayaan-3 will give impetus to India's deep space missions in future. With demonstrated skill and ability to land on the moon, it can plan its future missions with astronauts. The ISRO chairman has already indicated the space agency's plans of collaborating with Japan for its first moon landing. While Japan will develop the lander, ISRO will work on the scientific objectives of the mission.",

While details of the upcoming bike, slated to be unveiled in August, remain under wrap, it is expected to be an addition to the brand's 150-180cc segment lineup.The company already has two bikes in this displacement class- Honda Unicorn 160 and CB Hornet 2.0. A 162.7cc engine powers the Unicorn 160, while the CB Hornet 2.0 has an engine capacity of 184.4 cc. The upcoming two-wheeler is expected to adopt one of these engines, a Bikewale report said.Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) will only disclose the product during its launch event on August 2, an invite to which has already been sent out to the media. The model will be made available to purchase in the Indian market in the coming weeks, with deliveries beginning by the festive season in November-December. Similar to the previously launched Honda Shine 100, the company is likely to keep the existing brand name intact in the upcoming two-wheeler.The 162.7cc engine, which runs the Honda Unicorn 160, is a single-cylinder and air-cooled component. It has the capability of producing a maximum power of 12.73 BHP and 14 Nm of torque. The 184.4cc engine in Hornet 2.0 is also equipped with a single-cylinder, air-cooled motor. It can deliver 17.03 BHP of maximum power and 16.1 Nm of peak torque.Considering the current scenario of the Indian market, the price tag of a new motorcycle will play a pivotal role in attracting customers. So, the starting price of Honda's new two-wheeler model is anticipated to range around Rs 1.2 lakh (ex-showroom).Among Honda's existing motorcycles, the Unicorn 160 remains one of the top-selling products. But the Hornet 2.0 model has failed to achieve as much success as the company expected. There were some recent reports saying that Honda would introduce a new SP160 motorcycle based on the Unicorn.The design of the two-wheeler is expected to be similar to its younger sibling SP 125. The upcoming Honda SP160 is expected to come with a big fuel tank, a digital instrument panel and an all-LED headlamp. The front disc brake will be equipped with a single-channel ABS.

The film, which was launched at the San Diego Comic Con last week, is currently slated to release in January 2024. However, a report has now claimed that the filmmaker could delay the release of the film to the summer of 2024. According to India Today, Project K aka Kalki 2898 AD Part 1 could be pushed to May 9. The reason, the report claims, is that the said date is ausipicious to film's producer, Ashwini Dutt. Citing Telugu industry insiders, the report stated that May 9 has been lucky for the filmmaker. His films Jagadeka Veerudu Atiloka Sundari and Mahanati had released on May 9 and emerged as massive blockbusters. Owing to this, it is possible that Ashwini could delay Project K's release to May 9.The makers are yet to react to the report. Meanwhile, at the San Diego Comic-Con on Thursday, the makers unveiled the film's title, teaser, and release date. They revealed that the film is officially titled Kalki 2898 AD and its first glimpse features Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, and Prabhas in a futuristic setting. The teaser portrays them as warriors amidst a war-like scenario. While Deepika appears to be lined in a queue of soldiers, Amitabh Bachchan makes a short entry with his intense gaze. Lastly, the warrior avatar of Prabhas is released featuring a far more muscular and superior personality than fans have ever seen. If the first glimpse is anything to go by, it seems Prabhas is gearing up to wage a fierce war against the oppression of the weak by fighting a deadly regime. Present at the event were Prabhas, Kamal Haasan, and Rana Daggubati. According to a report, Deepika Padukone, who is a member of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Radio and Television Artists (SAG-AFTRA), won't be part of the event due to the ongoing strike by the union in the US. Amitabh was also forced to skip it due to his health. Project K became the first-ever Indian film to debut at the San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) in 2023. Before the event, a billboard for the",

    "article": "If other treatment methods have been unsuccessful, depending on your diagnosis, surgery may be an option to address your hip pain and mobility. There are various surgical options available, all intended to help restore your ability to move, alleviate your pain, and improve your quality of life. Talk to your surgeon about what may be right for you. Total hip replacement surgeryDuring total hip replacement surgery, the bone surfaces and cartilage that have been damaged are removed and replaced with implants. A standard total hip replacement has four parts: a cup, liner, ball, and stem. The cup is made of metal and fits into the natural hip socket. A liner, made of either a medical grade plastic called polyethylene or a ceramic material, fits inside the cup. The top of the femur is replaced with a metal, or ceramic, ball that is then attached to a metal stem that fits down into the thighbone (femur).These implants are designed to mimic the action of your natural hip joint, helping to restore movement and reduce painful bone-on-bone contact.Anterior hip surgeryAnterior hip surgery uses the same implants as total hip replacement surgery, but requires less cutting of the tissues around the hip. During traditional hip replacement surgery, an eight to 12-inch incision is made in the side or back of your leg. With anterior hip surgery, your doctor will make a three to six-inch incision. This procedure also allows your surgeon to preserve the tissue that keeps your joint tight, which might help minimize the risk of dislocation after surgeryRisks of joint replacementSome of the risks associated with joint replacement include infection, wear, implant or bone fracture, loosening, nerve damage and implant migration (movement); some patients continue to experience some pain after joint replacement. Individual results of joint surgery will vary. Your results will depend on your personal circumstances. How long a hip replacement will last varies from patient to patient. It depends on many factors, such as the patient's physical condition, activity level, and body weight and how well you follow doctor's orders. Replacement joints are not as strong or durable as natural, healthy joints, and there is no guarantee that a prosthetic joint will last the rest of a patient's life. All hip replacements may need to be replaced at some point. Talk to your surgeon about these and other risks associated with joint replacement.Description: Zimmer Biomet does not practice medicine and the content of this site is intended for general public interest.

    "article": "Will the results of the Karnataka Assembly elections 2023 affect the performance of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the coming general elections in 2024?In 2009, the BJP came to power in Karnataka, but their victory in the state did not benefit the party nationwide in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and the UPA won. Similarly, the Congress won Karnataka comfortably in 2013, but the BJP won the 2014 General elections. The Congress took 122 seats and established the government, whereas the BJP held just 40 seats, down from 110 in 2008. However, the BJP was able to win 17 out of the state's 28 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.However, the trend changed in 2018-2019 polls. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won a majority, while having a government in Karnataka as well. Karnataka has 28 Lok Sabha seats. In the previous four Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 18 seats in 2004, 19 in 2009, 17 in 2014, and 25 in 2019.  In terms of the vote share percentage of the BJP in previous Lok Sabha elections from Karnataka, it was 34.7% in 2004, 41.6% in 2009, 36.2% in 2014, and 51.75% in 2019. NO STRONG PM FACEIt seems that the opposition is still struggling to find a strong counter-candidate against the BJP's Narendra Modi as the PM face. The BJP took advantage of this in the general elections of 2014 and 2019, and set the agenda by raising the 'Modi versus Who' question.  According to a media survey, the 'brand Modi', which ranged from 5-10 per cent in Karnataka Assembly elections in 2018, reached 32 per cent in 2019.The BJP presented Modi as a development-oriented leader from Gujarat to a leader of international stature. The BJP leaders repeatedly stated that India's international standing has risen since PM Modi took over in 2014. PM Modi himself claimed that since his government took office, India has advanced in all dimensions of governance, diplomacy, and economics. WILL MODI FACTOR WORK IN 2024 ELECTIONS? As per the C-Voter survey of April 2023, there is a decline in PM Modi's popularity. However, he is still the most preferred choice for the PM's post, with 52 per cent votes in his favor compared to Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal, Nitish Kumar, and Rahul Gandhi. While in the same survey in 2022, PM Modi was the top choice of about 53 per cent of respondents. According to the January 2023 edition of India Today's Mood of the Nation poll, BJP candidate Narendra Modi is continuously nation's leading choice for the post of Prime Minister with 52% of the votes in the survey. On the other hand, 14% of people want Congress' former President Rahul Gandhi as the next prime minister.MODI VS OTHER BJP LEADERS?In the January 2023 edition of India Today's Mood of the Nation poll, other BJP leaders got fewer votes than PM Modi. The other BJP leaders were Home Minister Amit Shah (26%), Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath (25%), and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari (16%).Even if the BJP did not win in the Karnataka Assembly elections 2023, it still has the potential to win in the Lok Sabha elections, as the opposition still does not have a strong candidate for the PM post.",

    "article": "Amid the split in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Ajit Pawar joining the Maharashtra government as the deputy Chief Minister, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, spoke exclusively to News18 Lokmat, saying his Shiv Sena is not upset about the new development. ALSO READ | Maha CM Eknath Shinde: No Cold War with Devendra Fadnavis, Ready for Mumbai Civic Polls | ExclusiveWhile refuting that they caused the NCP split, he said leaders from Uddhav Thackeray's Sena are joining him because they trust his work and government.DISGRUNTLED SENA?When asked if there was disgruntlement in his Shiv Sena because of the NCP's entry, Shinde dismissed it as 'rumours'. 'All these are rumors. Who will go? And where? To those who are sitting at home or to a broken boat? Not one paper was signed in two-and-a-half years. MLAs are witness to the change in the past one year. So much work has been done in their constituencies in one year. Who will go and voluntarily fall into a pit,' Shinde asked.ON BREAKING UP THE NCP'Ajit dada had clarified after the split that Sharad Pawar saheb has been taking the decisions. In 2017, in 2019, he took a call on alliances. Ajit dada and Chhagan Bhujbal have clearly stated this. I don't think we need to say anything on that now,' he said.ON UDDHAV THACKERAYWhen asked about Uddhav Thackeray touring the state, Shinde said, 'He should have done it earlier. It is too late now. What is the point of walking around now? You have lost what you had. Balasaheb Thackeray used to stand by his colleagues whenever they faced any difficulty. When there is ego, you start thinking of yourself as the owner and the other person as a slave. You need a large heart to run a party, you have to support and boost the morale of the workers. When they rise, they take the party along. A party which has insecurity cannot make it big,' said Shinde.'SHOOT MYSELF STATEMENT'Shinde said that his alleged statement that 'I will shoot myself if nothing comes out of this Sena rebellion' was distorted. 'It was my responsibility to ensure that the political future of those who came with me should not be jeopardized. No one should be harmed. That is the way I work. When I won difficult elections, I gave credit to my colleagues, but when I lost, I took responsibility for it,' he said.'ON UDDHAV SENA LEADERS JOINING HIS PARTY''Why shouldn't people come? They trust our government. Neelam Gorhe joined us. Did we offer her money (khoke)? The truth will come out in the probe into the handling of Covid by the Mumbai civic body. 50 MLAs, 13 MLCs, scores of corporators and workers are leaving them. They need to introspect why people are leaving them. Once you leave, they call you useless, but when you are with them you are precious,' Shinde said, adding, 'They can conduct a probe into Thane and Kalyan civic bodies' functioning. The scams in buying body bags, the way Covid centres were handled by inexperienced people, the faulty oxygen plants led to black fungus leading to deaths\u2026'ON THE NCP SPLIT'When a capable, hardworking person is ignored or suppressed or given a secondary place, such incidents happen. If any party chief wants to make the party big, he has to keep his family and personal ambitions aside,' he said. 'ON MNS's CAMPAIGN'Commenting on the campaign being run by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), seeking signatures from those who are angry, Shinde said, 'I have no idea who is angry. My relations with MNS chief Raj Thackeray are cordial. We recently met and spoke about Nashik and BDD chawl issues.'",

    "article": "Recipients of government awards should be made to give their written consent and sign an undertaking before the honour is bestowed, a parliamentary committee has proposed to discourage awardees from returning awards at a later date over 'political reasons', a gesture popularly called 'award-wapsi'.The Parliamentary Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture tabled the report titled 'Functioning of National Akademis and Other Cultural Institution' in Parliament on Monday. 'The Committee suggests that whenever an award is given, the consent of the recipient must be taken, so that he\/she does not return it because of political reasons; as it is disgraceful to the country,' said the committee headed by YSRCP's Vijay Sai Reddy.Prominent members of the committee are Dr Sonal Man Singh, Manoj Tewari, Chedi Pehelwan, Dinesh Lal Yadav 'Niruaha', Tirath Singh Rawat, Rajani Patil, Tapir Gao and Rajiv Pratap Rudy.Justifying the proposal, the committee said the Sahitya Academy and other institutions are apolitical organisations that have 'no place for politicism'.'The instances of recipients of awards, given by Akademis (such as Sahitya Akademi Awards), returning their awards in protest of certain political issues which are outside the ambit of the cultural realms and the autonomous functioning of the concerned Akademi\u2026 Such inappropriate incidents involving the return of awards undermine the achievements of the other awardees and also impact the overall prestige and reputation of the awards (sic),' says the report.The Committee also questioned the re-engagement of such awardees who joined the Akademi after 'insulting it' and recommended that prior concurrence of shortlisted candidates be taken. 'A system may be put in place where an undertaking is taken from the proposed awardee citing acceptance of the award and that the awardees cannot dishonour the award at any point of time in future.Awards may not be given without such an undertaking. In the event that the awards are returned, the awardee shall not be considered for such award in the award in the future.'The Committee, however, faced internal opposition, with two members objecting to the recommendation of seeking 'written consent'. The report states that one member asked the Committee to ' strongly recommend to the Government to look into the actual issues in protest of which such awards have been returned and work towards resolving them'. The same was seconded by another member.The dissenting members argued that India is a democratic country and the Constitution has provided to every citizen the Freedom of Speech and Expression and also the freedom to protest in any form. 'Returning of awards is only a form of protest,' the reported quoted them as saying.Opposition MPs Karti Chidambaram of the Congress and TKS Elangovan of the DMK also took objection to the Committee's recommendations. 'It is a ridiculous suggestion which takes away the fundamental right to expression, including the right to protest. Every award recipient has the right to his or her opinion on whether they want to accept the award or not. There are instances of even Olympic athletes returning their awards in protest,' Karti Chidambaram said.Elangovan agreed. 'Returning the award is not a disgrace. What the government is doing is a disgrace to the country,' he said.BJP's RP Singh said this is only a suggestion and not a rule. 'The ministry will see what to do about the recommendation, but returning an award is not a good thing.' Most notably, 33 recipients, led by Uday Prakash, Nayantara Sehgal and Ashok Vajapyee, had returned their awards following the 2015 Kalburgi murder case. The practice since then has become a popular tool of protest. The most recent instance was prominent wrestlers threatening to throw their medals in the Ganga during their protest against WFI president Brij Bhushan Singh who faces sexual harassment allegations.At present, the Padma Awards are announced after consent is taken from the proposed awardees. Many on the list, however, decline to accept the honour after the list is made public.",

It also recommends not re-engaging awardees who return their awards in protest.

Private lender on Saturday reported a 40 per cent rise in standalone net profit to Rs 9,648 crore for the June 2023 quarter, helped by a decline in bad loans and an improvement in interest income.

They also remain positive about the growth prospects of the company.'ICICI Bank reported another steady quarter, driven by healthy NII and core PPoP (pre-provision operating profit) growth and controlled provisions underpinned by stable asset quality.

After a strong outperformance backed by robust earnings growth (three-year CAGR of nearly 60 per cent), we estimate earnings growth to moderate to an 18 per cent CAGR over FY23-25, affected largely by a decline in margins and limited levers available on the opex\/credit cost front,' Motilal Oswal said.CLSA has given a target of Rs 1225 per share on ICICI Bank backed by strong growth and confident commentary.

    "article": "International Cricket Council's (ICC) decision to change slow over-rate sanctions in the middle of ongoing Ashes between England and Australia has raised questions on timing of the move. The recent revelations by Usman Khawaja, where he claimed to have played a crucial role in discussions with ICC General Manager Wasim Khan, who happens to be his good friend, added fuel to the fire.News18 CricketNext reached out to ICC and questioned the timing of the rule change. A spokesperson revealed GM Khan spoke with number of head coaches, 'including at the WTC final'.'Recently the GM &amp;#8211; Cricket has been in dialogue with a number of Head Coaches, including at the World Test Championship Final, on areas that can be improved in the game from overrates to pitch markings,' said the ICC spokesperson.A top BCCI source, however, has categorically denied any discussions with ICC on slow over-rate sanctions or concerns around them. Neither the head coach Rahul Dravid or any player has had a chat with ICC before, during and after the WTC final.'There has been no dialogue with the ICC on slow over-rate sanctions. I can confirm that neither the head coach Dravid nor any player spoke with the ICC or raised any concerns regarding the old arrangement,' says the BCCI source.The source further explained that since India mostly plays two or three spinners, the over-rate is never a major concern. The exception came at the WTC final where India went with Ravindra Jadeja alongside four seamers.'Let's understand that India play two spinners in most of the Tests and some of our home Tests, three spinners are in action. So over-rate is never a major concern for us, hence there was never any dialogue with the ICC. The recent WTC final, where India were fined, was probably one of the few occasions where India played just one spinner,' adds the source.The role of GM Wasim KhanAfter his controversial remark on India-Pakistan fixture earlier this year, ICC GM Khan is again in the news for his role in taking Khawaja and Australian camp's over-rate concerns to the table. The global cricketing body says Khan is also a member of the Men's Cricket Committee, chaired by former India captain Sourav Ganguly, and constantly engages with cricket boards, players or officials for feedback.'The ICC General Manager &amp;#8211; Cricket is also a member of the Men's and Women's Cricket Committees and is therefore available to discuss cricket matters whether it is directly with Cricket Boards, players or officials. Ensuring the ICC is open to feedback and ideas in the pursuit of making improvements in our game is critical for any progressive sport. Cricket Boards and players are keen to engage with ICC about different cricketing topics and areas involved within the game,' says the ICC spokesperson.Wasim Khan (Reuters Photo)Any feedback which merits a discussion first reaches the Ganguly-led committee's table which then pushes it to the ICC CEC for approval.'Areas of concern or issues are raised with the GM - Cricket either from international team management, or directly by the Cricket Boards. Those matters are then escalated to Sourav Ganguly, the Chair of the Men's Cricket Committee, or to Clare Connor, the Chair of the Women's Cricket Committee for further examination. They will then decide on whether the topic requires further debate and action at the Committees which are made up of former and current players, match officials and broadcasters from around the world. Any recommendations from the Cricket Committees as a result of these discussions are then taken forward to CEC for approval,' adds the spokesperson.The ICC CEC approved changes to over-rate sanctions at the annual conference in Durban last week and it was decided that it would be 'applied from the start of the current World Test Championship cycle'. As CricketNext reported on July 18, the existing sanctions, imposed during the ongoing Ashes, will not be completely waived off.'Fines and penalty points will not be universally waived from the first three Test matches, instead they will be re-calculated and the appropriate sanctions will be applied in line with the agreed changes to the revised threshold. It is important to note that if teams are found guilty of breaching the overrate requirements, WTC penalty points will apply, as will reduced player fines,' explains the ICC spokesperson.",

    "article": "The year 2022 has been the worst year for the cryptocurrencies, the virtual assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Polygon saw sharp plunges multiple times in the current calendar year. The year also saw the fall of a major crypto exchange FTX due to the liquidity crisis. In India, crypto exchanges were also raided by authorities. Experts said that the downfall in cryptos will continue in 2023 also due to systemic issues in the crypto world.Major private cryptocurrency Bitcoin has seen a massive decline of about 65 per cent in the current financial year to $16,833 on December 23, 2022, compared with about $47,600 at the beginning of the year (January 1). Similarly, Ethereum also crashed about 68.15 per cent year-to-date to $1,221 on December 23, compared with $3,834 on January 1, 2022.Polygon or MATIC had stood at $2.56 apiece on January 1, 2022, and has now plummeted to $0.80 on December 23, 2022.In 2022, all the cryptocurrencies witnessed high volatility and saw a 70-80 per cent swing in their highest and lowest prices during the year.Vivek Iyer, partner and leader (financial services risk) at Grant Thornton Bharat, said, 'The calendar year 2022 was probably the worst year for cryptocurrencies, due to the implosion of FTX and the massive fall from grace of its founder Sam Bankman Fried.

First, the need to focus on outreach to castes and communities that have poor or no representation in the BJP. Second, identifying strong non-BJP leaders who might be unhappy with the policies of the party they are currently in and convincing them that the Narendra Modi government believes in working for all. Third, the focus needs to be on looking at the pros and cons of any state-related alliances. Finally, the focus needs to be on identifying issues that concern the state specifically and bringing them to the fore,' a source told News18.The big focus of the saffron party in the coming days and weeks will be to emphatically state its narrative irrespective of the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in whose name the party has been contesting elections.'There is an urgent and important need for the BJP to specify its narrative and spell it out clearly. Be it general elections or Assembly elections, the party needs to clearly speak out in one voice about the principles and commitments to the cause of the nation,' another source told News18 following Sunday's meeting.With around six months to go before campaigning for Lok Sabha elections begins in full swing, party units in southern states have been asked to come up with a well-conceived action plan that can be executed well.In other states of the country, booth strengthening drives, micro-level management and membership drives have done wonders for the party. But despite holding down majority in the Lok Sabha in 2014 and 2019, electoral success in the southern states has eluded the BJP.The party is now hoping to take corrective steps at the earliest in the backdrop of the recent election defeat in Karnataka.Politics in southern India has been largely personality driven &amp;#8212; Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi in Tamil Nadu to KCR in Telangana, and Chandrababu Naidu and Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh.Of 130 MPs from the five southern states, the BJP only has 29, most of whom are from Karnataka.'Three morcha chiefs &amp;#8212; Tejasvi Surya (Yuva Morcha), Vanathi Srinivasan (Mahila Morcha) and K Laxman (OBC Morcha) are from the south. Even in the Union government, four ministers &amp;#8212; Nirmala Sitharaman, S Jaishankar, Pralhad Joshi and Kishen Reddy are from the south. The Modi cabinet also has six MoS from southern India,' said a BJP insider, adding that in Sunday's meeting, directions were passed to showcase the representation among people.Those present were also told to highlight the fact that even in the top-most decision-making body of the party, southern representation is sizeable. BS Yediyurappa and BL Santhosh are both members of the BJP Parliamentary Board.The party's top leadership has expressed confidence in improving its performance in the south with alliance being explored with the TDP in Andhra Pradesh and strengthening the one with AIADMK in Tamil Nadu.The party which held meetings of state leaders in three batches saw the last one conclude in Hyderabad on Sunday. Leaders from 11 states and Union Territories were present in the meeting, including Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu Telangana, Goa, Maharashtra and Puducherry.On July 7, a meeting was held in Guwahati for the eastern and north-eastern states and in Delhi on July 8 for northern and central states.The party is likely to organise a brainstorming session of all state presidents in the end of July or the first week of August.",

The meeting underscored the importance of articulating the BJP's narrative clearly, especially in light of recent electoral setbacks in states like Karnataka.

He repaid the faith with 27 wickets in 14 matches to finish as the joint-second highest wicket-taker of IPL 2023.Such was his performance throughout the season that he was entrusted by GT captain Hardik Pandya to bowl the difficult overs towards the end of innings.In the IPL 2023 final, he was asked to defend 13 runs in the last over of Chennai Super Kings' chase. The 34-year-old nearly aced the challenge after bowling four excellent deliveries, one of them a dot ball.And then it went downhill. Ravindra Jadeja, the batter, smashed a straight six and then guided a low full toss to fine leg for the winning boundary leaving Mohit heartbroken as others lined up to console him.'I couldn't sleep. Sochta raha kya alag karta joh match jeet jaate (Kept wondering what could I do differently that we would have won). What if I could have bowled this ball or that ball? It's not a nice feeling now. Somewhere something is missing but I'm trying to move on,' Mohit told The Indian Express.'I ran and tried to bowl (yorker) again. I just wanted to be focussed and back myself. Whole IPL I have done that. The ball landed where it shouldn't have and Jadeja got his bat. I tried, I tried my best,' he said.Mohit says he practiced for such situations during the nets and knew what needed to be done when the challenge finally was thrown to him.'My mind was very clear in what I wanted to do. In the nets, I had practiced such situations and I have been in such scenarios before too. So I said let me bowl all balls yorkers and was backing my instinct,' he said.Despite the late blip, Mohit is proud of his season pointing out how former BCCI treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary advised him to continue playing.'I was picked from nowhere. I remember speaking to Ani bhai before the season what shall I do? Shall I continue or not. He had said I should try to play. I had come with no expectation and just have continued to work hard. My work ethic has remained the same. I don't know what lies ahead, but I have enjoyed my journey,' Mohit said.",

As soon as the remnants of the powerful Cyclone Biporjoy diffused, the monsoon galloped through the Indo-Gangetic plains and made up for the lost time.The bursts of heavy rains in the last days of June have reduced the overall rainfall deficit for the country from -51 per cent 10 days ago to -19 per cent from its long-period average (LPA).But what this data fails to show is the staggering rainfall deficit that still persists in the eastern region consisting of states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal where farmers are gearing up to sow their Kharif crops.47% OF AREA RAIN-DEPRIVEDOf the total 36 sub-divisions across the country, as many as 20 are still reeling under deficient rains. This sub-divisional area makes up for about 47 per cent of India's land comprising Bihar, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, East Uttar Pradesh, Vidarbha, Telangana, Rayalseema and Chhattisgarh.The rainfall deficit in crucial rice-growing states like Bihar has widened to -78 per cent, while it is over -50 per cent for East Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal. While this is just June, the situation does spark concerns, considering all these four states had ended up with a subpar monsoon last year.A good monsoon is extremely crucial for the Indo-Gangetic plains, which are hugely dependent on the seasonal rains to irrigate their Kharif crops. The four-month season is responsible for providing 70 per cent of the annual rains to the country whose GDP is powered by agriculture.DESTRUCTIVE DOWNPOUR, 'UNUSUAL' MONSOON PATTERNSWhile one part of the country awaits rainfall, the other faces monsoon fury. The sudden fillip to the monsoon has triggered deluge in Assam, flash floods and landslides in Himachal Pradesh and excess rains in North-west India. Heavy rainfall alert has also been sounded for Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan over the next few days.This is just what the climate scientists have been warning all along. The number of days with heavy rainfall are increasing, while days with less to moderate rains are on decline. This means there will be longer dry periods interspersed with short spells of heavy downpour. Persistent warming of the atmosphere and ocean is intensifying extreme weather events. One such study by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, shows that there has been a three-fold increase in extreme rainfall events during 1950-2015. The warming is changing weather patterns. The monsoon, which usually makes its onset over Mumbai on June 11, arrived in the coastal city almost two weeks later. It made quite a historic onset bringing rains over Delhi and Mumbai on the same-day &amp;#8212; a coincidence that last occurred in 1961.Scientists tracking the monsoon patterns attributed it to an ''unusual' tilt in the monsoon trough and Cyclone Biparjoy. The very severe storm intensified in the Arabian Sea for nearly nine days, and absorbed moisture from the monsoon just when it was bracing to impact Kerala and ended up weakening its progress along the west coast.",

This accelerated pace was crucial in mitigating the country's rainfall deficit, which significantly dropped from -51 per cent to -19 per cent against its long-period average. However, this improvement masks the severe rainfall shortages still plaguing the eastern regions, notably Bihar, Jharkhand, and Gangetic West Bengal, where the agriculture sector anxiously awaits the monsoon for Kharif cropping. Despite this partial relief, nearly half of India's sub-divisions continue to suffer from insufficient rainfall, exacerbating concerns in major rice-producing areas. Meanwhile, other parts of the country face extreme weather conditions, from devastating floods in Assam to unprecedented rainfall patterns, underscoring the urgent need to address climate change's impact on monsoon behaviors.",

    "article": "Senior member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and prominent Sunni cleric Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali has launched a drive after Friday prayers in Uttar Pradesh against the proposed Uniform Civil Code (UCC).Speaking to CNN-News18 on the row, the Maulana called the Uniform Civil Code an act that would adversely affect the Personal Law Board which, he said, is based on Sharia principles.On July 5, the AIMPLB, after holding an hours-long meeting in Lucknow, handed over a draft of the Uniform Civil Code to the Law Commission, listing its objections to the proposed legislation and highlighting the rights enshrined for the community in the Constitution.Listing out the reasons for dissent, he said: 'Uniform Civil Code is nothing but a political gimmick. It is not practical and will certainly leave an adverse effect not only on Muslims but people of all religions in India. Muslim Personal Law board is founded on Sharia principles and any changes or modifications made to it will not be tolerated by Muslims. Hence, I urge people to come forward and register their protest against UCC in order to turn down the proposal.'When asked why the Maulana had said in one of his recent statements that UCC would have adverse effects on individuals from all religions, he said: 'You can't have the same set of rules for different religions. What a person belonging to Muslim community follows is far different from the religious practices followed by a person belonging to the Jain, Christian or Sikh community. How can you have the same set of rules for all?'The AIMPLB and Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind were first to register their protest against UCC while Jamaat-e-Islami Hind refrained from commenting. Questioned about the divided opinion among Muslim organisations, the Maulana said: 'I think it's time to unite and fight as one. AIMPLB, I believe, has representation of almost all big and small Muslim organisations and when AIMPLB has taken a stand on any issue, it is considered the collective stand. The Law Commission has asked the point of view of the general public and organisations on the issue of UCC, following which AIMPLB and other Muslim organisations submitted the draft in order to register their protest.'The Maulana said they had appealed to Imams of all mosques to make 'namaazis' aware of Muslim personal law. 'Sharia law is the foundation of Muslim personal law and hence, no human can make any modifications to it. AIMPLB has also launched its own QR code that will be placed outside mosques. People can scan the code using their smartphones and register their protest against UCC. Their reaction will be registered on the Law Commission's site. For those who don't want to follow personal law, there is also an option of a Special Marriage Act in our law. Hence, there is no need for UCC.'In the course of the conversation, the Maulana was also asked about RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale's latest interview to News18 where he said UCC was part of the Indian Constitution and suggested by its architects. He had also said that it was not only about polygamy or other social practices of Muslims but more about social and legal matters related to maintenance, inheritance, and succession.Responding to Hosabale's statement, the Maulana said: 'Our Constitution gives the right to each and every citizen of India to follow any religion or culture. I want to highlight the fact that even before India attained its freedom from the British clutches, the leaders have always assured us that there will be no interference in Muslim personal law. Mahatma Gandhi, during the famous round table conference held in 1931 in London, had assured that no law would interfere in Muslim personal law.'Despite this, the matter of UCC is being raked up in order to gain political mileage. AIMPLB has strongly opposed the law and the board has also decided that there will be no protest against UCC on the roads. We have appealed to common people to register their protest against UCC and I think people are smart enough to understand their rights.'\u200b",

Despite divided opinions among Muslim organizations, Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind aims to unite them against UCC. They have launched a QR code for mosque-goers to register their protest and emphasized the option of the Special Marriage Act for those not following personal law. Maulana also refuted RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale's claim that UCC is part of the Indian Constitution, recalling historical assurances against interference in Muslim personal law.",

In the original article, it was AIMPLB that launched the drive against UCC and submitted objections to the Law Commission, not Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind.",

Mappls App is among the top 15 applications in the Google Play Store across all categories, ahead of any other app in related categories (maps and navigation, as well as travel and local). Google Maps is not one of the Google Play Store's top 100 applications.The app is supported by the most advanced and cutting-edge underlying map data and technology, allowing all users to have the smartest, safest, and most accurate maps and navigation experience possible in the country. The company built India's very first internet mapping platform and portal, MapmyIndia.com (now called Mappls.com) in 2004.Speaking to News18 about the success, Rohan Verma CEO &amp;#038; ED, MapmyIndia &amp;#038; Mappls, said: 'The large majority, 95% of people, from India mainly downloaded Mappls App as the app is mainly focused on giving mapping information about this country. It also happened at a time when we simply did no advertisement. Some NRIs from the US, Canada and the Middle East are also downloading this app, but mainly because they want to see their country.''In the past few months, people have suddenly realised why use Google Maps when Mapples App provides so many details. All this happened in a very organic way, we never paid any influencer to do a video on this, did not go for any advertisement, but people started to talk about it and one after another people started to use this app,' he added. About taking this app to other countries, Verma stated that, eventually, the company may plan something but currently, considering the large size of the market in India, the focus is helping hundreds of millions of citizens with safer road mapping features such as junction view, speed limit alerts, toll cost and trip cost on a route, safety alerts for upcoming speed breakers, sharp curves and potholes. 'We want to solve India's issues and work for this country first, and eventually we want to go international. But right now the core focus is India,' said Verma.",

    "article": "The apex health regulatory agency of India has rolled out a major proposal for creating a single-window online portal to digitise the regulation of medicines, cosmetics and medical devices in India. The idea for the project was conceived at a 'chintan shivir' organised by the health ministry in February.The project will be spearheaded by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). In a letter to all stakeholders across states and union territories, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) Rajeev Raghuvanshi, who is the head of the CDSCO, called for a unified online portal as 'a unique solution to the various problems faced by all the stakeholders'.'&amp;#8230;a unified online portal for all the regulatory activity involving stakes from all the stakeholders is being proposed,' he wrote, calling the proposed portal a 'single window' and 'single sign-on' system. According to the proposal, accessed by News18, the dashboard for the online portal will have multiple roles apart from maintaining massive data on drugs. It pitches the need for digital transformation and setting up a digital regulatory system (DRS). Raghuvanshi, in his letter, explained to stakeholders that the dashboard 'can be used for collection and monitoring government policies and scheme as and when required'. (sic)How a digital regulatory system will workAs explained in 12 points, the digital system aims at creating a database - be it of manufacturers, excipients or intermediate suppliers, marketers, or primary packing material among others. Further, it aims at registering all vendors and stakeholders on the central portal to 'track and trace the supply chain'. The DCGI has also proposed to develop a 'master registration of drugs', which will create an online database of all licensed entities and permitted products manufactured and sold in India. It also aims to collect massive data on the consumption of drugs with respect to category, quantity, area and season.A critical suggestion is the 'maintenance of a database of not of standard quality or spurious or adulterated or misbranded products in the public domain'. In the sixth point, the proposal aims to improve interstate coordination on issues such as 'not of standard quality' (NSQ) medicines or issues to tackle movement of spurious drugs, investigation and launching of prosecution.'Measure and monitor corrective and\/or punitive outcomes of vigilance\/enforcement,' states the proposal as one of the objectives of the portal.The collected data can be used during emergency and pandemic situations, the proposal stated while adding that the system will also create a 'complaint redressal mechanism with a dedicated online ticket system'.It states that one of the main objectives of bringing the regulatory systems online is the 'integration of multiple government agencies', which are involved in the regulation of drugs licensing and permission.The list includes the names of 11 agencies connected to the system, including all state licensing authorities, National Institute of Biologicals (NIB), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, Bureau of Indian Standards and Department of Consumer Affairs.  What triggered the shift from offline to onlineThe letter stated that one of the main interventions of the central government is to achieve its public health objectives, which include ensuring that the 'drugs available in the country are safe, efficacious and conform to prescribed quality standards'.'The drug regulatory system is responsible for protecting public health by assuring safety, efficacy and quality of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, diagnostics and cosmetics,' Raghuvanshi said in the letter. He added that the drug regulatory system is also responsible for 'advancing public health by keeping its systems contemporary and by helping to speed up innovations that make pharmacotherapy safer and more effective'.'The regulatory system also helps the consumers in getting accurate and adequate information concerning the appropriate use of medicines and related products,' the letter stated.",

It is performed with the intention of ensuring that the remains are suitable for public display at a funeral, for religious reasons, or for preserving the body if the final rites are to be conducted at a later date.State laws regarding embalming vary, but typically it is mandatory when a body is being transported by plane or train across state lines or international borders or if there is a considerable time gap of a week or more between the time of death and the scheduled burial or cremation. In rare cases, embalming may be required if the cause of death is due to a communicable disease, and the process is deemed necessary to protect the public.",

    "article": "Talks of a global recession have been drumming up recently, with experts worldwide pointing out ominous signs. According to reports from the S&P global market intelligence, the global gross domestic product (GDP) is set to slow down to 2.8% this year, dipping even further to just 2% in 2023. Even the World Bank recently highlighted how the global economy is experiencing its greatest slowdown since the 1970s, and that recession in 2023 seems imminent.Since the start of this year, when Russia invaded Ukrainian territory, the world has been battling serious supply chain disruptions and soaring energy costs. That, in turn, has led to increased pressure on product prices, driving inflation levels to record highs everywhere.As a thumb rule, two consecutive quarters of economic decline indicate a recessionary phase. Naturally, money management in these periods is tough. In such times, as Sanjeev Dawar, veteran financial planner, puts it, 'Comprehensive financial management for these periods involves taking care of earning, savings, spending, investment, borrowings, and estate planning.''Asset allocation is a crucial ingredient to recession-proof one's financial life. It means distributing your equity, debt, real estate, and gold investment. The quantum will vary as per the investor's life stage and life goals. A young investor has a high-risk tolerance therefore a higher exposure to equity is favourable. On the contrary, the portfolio for a retired individual has to be conservative as capital protection is the key objective,' he continues.But how can we roughly gauge the impact of recession from items we use every day? Here's how lipsticks, garbage, and dating sites can help you get an idea:While not conclusive, the idea of the lipstick index is essentially to underline how affordable, budget luxury, or self-care is not forgone during such times, even when people are sacrificing more expensive and luxurious things like a swanky car, a new house, or more. As per data from NPD, lipstick sales in the first quarter of 2022 jumped by 48%. Makeup sales in general, have risen by 20% in the first 6 months of 2022.The idea was put forth by cosmetic behemoth Estee Lauder in the noughties when the world was reeling under the adverse economic impact of the dot-com bubble. The firm noticed a steep spike in the sale of its lipsticks. Clearly, beauty shines as a bright spot during recessionary times.More production and consumption implies more waste creation. Since the economy is slowing down, the underlying assumption is that people will spend less, hence, will generate less waste. However, some experts don't see it as an accurate indicator.The new Date Index is another indicator. Data from Sensor Tower shows that monthly active users on prominent dating and networking sites like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge rose by 17% in January 2022, as compared to growth in the same month 3 years before. In fact, last year, the collective first-time downloads for these 3 apps touched 106.4 million, as the younger generation flocks to these sites.Read all the Latest Business News and Breaking News here",

    "article": "Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) patriarch Sharad Pawar will hold a meeting of opposition parties in Delhi on Tuesday, a day after his second meeting with poll strategist Prashant Kishor in two weeks fuelled rumours of a joint opposition attack on the BJP under 'Mission 2024&amp;#8242;.The meeting of the Rashtra Manch, which was formed by turncoat Yashwant Sinha in 2018, against the policies of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government will be held in Delhi at 4pm at Pawar's residence. This is the first time Pawar will participate in the meeting of the outfit.Kishor and Pawar met in Delhi on Monday, days after their last meeting at the NCP leader's Mumbai home on June 11. According to NCP leader Nawab Malik, the meeting to discuss the 'current scenario in our country' will be attended by Yashwant Sinha, Pawan Verma, Sanjay Singh, D Raja, Farooq Abdullah, Justice A P Singh, Javed Akhtar, K T S Tulsi, Karan Thapar, Ashutosh, Adv. Majeed Memon, Vandana Chavan MP, S Y Qureshi former CEC, K C Singh, Sanjay Jha, Sudheendra Kulkarni, Colin Gonsalves, Arun Kumar Economist, Ghanshyam Tiwari and Pritish Nandi. Yashwant Sinha is also considered close to Kishor, who scripted the Trinamool Congress' win in West Bengal. Moreover, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee's approval of the manch is public knowledge. To add to this, erstwhile TMC leader Dinesh Trivedi has been a participant of the manch's earlier meetings.The election victory in Bengal has come as a shot in the arm for the opposition, giving it confidence to take on the BJP behemoth. Several parties have reportedly indicated their willingness to join an alliance minus the BJP or the Congress, say sources.Soon after her victory in the West Bengal polls, Banerjee was asked whether she saw herself as the opposition prime ministerial candidate. 'I think all together, we can fight the battle for 2024. But let's fight Covid first,' she had said.Both Banerjee and Pawar share a close rapport and have spoken vociferously for a joint opposition front against the BJP, which is not under the leadership of Congress' Rahul Gandhi.In Maharashtra, where rumours are doing the rounds of the Shiv Sena warming up to the BJP, Sena leader Sanjay Raut had talked about the need for an alliance of opposition parties at the national level. Raut had said that he had spoken to Pawar about the issue.The Kishor-Pawar meeting is coincidentally taking place at a time when top Shiv Sena leaders have gone on record stating that their relationship with PM Narendra Modi was not broken even though they are not politically together now.The political atmosphere in Maharashtra too is volatile at this point, where Shiv Sena has been keen to show that BJP's doors aren't closed for it. Sharad Pawar had, in a rare public speech, reminded the Sena of its reliability and trustworthiness. 'Once Sena gives its word, it lives by it. On 1977, Sena had stood strongly behind Indira Gandhi after Balasaheb Thackeray had given his word. This government will complete its term of 5 years, and will work for vidhan sabha and lok sabha thereafter,' he had said.

    "article": "Opposition in Assam recently flooded social media with pictures of themselves resting under shade trees, accompanied by bold quotes expressing the belief that this practice would save them from soaring electric bills, in addition to providing relief from the scorching heat.Social media influencers also joined in, taking pictures with trees and posting them on their sites, promoting the idea of saving on electric bills.The Tree Politics The driving force behind this trend was the advice given by Assam Assembly Speaker Biswajit Daimary, who suggested that state residents spend time under trees as a means to reduce power bills.He emphasized the need to explore alternatives and reduce dependence on external sources for electricity, as the state does not have its own electricity production.Beyond the political discourse and social implications, trees in Assam are indeed playing a crucial role in saving the state's major economy from the scorching sun and inadequate rainfall, preventing it from wilting.Despite the relief brought by the welcome monsoon rains, the damage has already been done, with temperatures ranging from 36 to 39 degrees Celsius in May and early June. The tea industry of Assam, which is already grappling with production and marketing obstacles, has been further impacted by a significant decline in rainfall.The Doomdoma area of Tinsukia district experienced a 33% decrease in rainfall compared to the previous year, exacerbating the challenges faced by the industry.According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Assam recorded a 38% deficit in rainfall during the pre-monsoon period from March 1 to May 31, resulting in scorching heat that disrupted normal life in the state. Last year, the state experienced 40% excess rainfall during the same period.The IMD statement revealed that Assam received only 337 mm of rain, far below the normal 542 mm, during the pre-monsoon period. The entire northeastern region recorded a deficit of 35% in rainfall during this period, with 242 mm of rainfall against the normal 373 mm.Ghana Sirish Niche (Beneath the Gulmohar)The shade provided by trees has become an integral part of the tea industry's survival in such severe and extremely hot climates. It helps maintain the optimal temperature for tea bushes, enabling maximum productivity through photosynthesis.Tea bushes require a specific temperature range for optimum photosynthesis, and shade trees play a crucial role in maintaining this temperature, preventing the detrimental effects of extreme weather conditions.Furthermore, shade trees in tea estates, predominantly from the Leguminacea family, contribute to nitrogen fixation and soil fertility. The dropping of leaves adds organic matter and nutrients to the soil, while the trees themselves buffer soil temperature fluctuations and preserve moisture during dry periods.They also reduce the incidence of pests and mite attacks, ultimately leading to better quality tea production and value addition. Additionally, shade trees provide relief to workers who labour in extreme weather conditions.The tradition of growing shade trees in tea plantations originated in the northeast and later spread to other regions. Initially, the Sau tree (Albizzia chinensis) was grown in Assam's tea plantations and was considered a tea-fertilizing tree.However, it was realized that shade trees not only provide nutrients to the soil but also have various beneficial effects on tea plants, especially in areas where high leaf temperatures can damage photosynthesis.Shade trees are necessary because air temperatures above 30\u00b0C and below 13\u00b0C are harmful to tea plant growth.In Assam, where air temperatures frequently exceed 30\u00b0C during the harvesting period, shade trees are interplanted to maintain temperatures within a favourable range.While wind velocity can help reduce leaf temperature, the Brahmaputra valley in Assam experiences low wind velocity due to the sheltering effect of the hills on either side of the valley and for that shade is needed in a tea plantation to keep the leaf temperature down.However, in those areas where the air temperature is high but the wind velocity is also high, shade is not needed. Benefits of Shade Trees.200 Years of Assam TeaIn all the heat of things, there is some good news for Assam tea as it completes 200 years, the state government has decided to grant tax exemption on agriculture income for a period of three years with effect from April 1.The state cabinet approved to issuing of notification under the Assam Agriculture Income Tax Act, 1939 for granting tax exemption on agricultural income for a period of 3 years with effect from April 1 this year and a decision has been taken in celebration of 200 years Assam tea industry.",

The state, grappling with a significant rainfall deficit and high temperatures, has seen its tea industry, a major economic contributor, suffer due to these climatic challenges. The shade from trees not only offers a respite from the heat but also supports tea bush productivity through optimal photosynthesis conditions.

The ATS managed to access a cloud storage account of the accused persons and found a video in which they can be seen pledging allegiance to ISKP while flashing sharp weapons, a media release of the ATS has said.Allegedly as directed by Abu Hamza, the three men\u2014Ubaid Nasir Mir, Hanan Hayat Shawal, and Mohammad Hajim Shah\u2014had reached Porbandar to work as fishermen on boats. They planned to cross the International Maritime Boundary Line and reach Afghanistan via Iran and join ISKP, the ATS said, adding that it found mobile phones, tablets and sharp weapons in the bags of the accused. Their handler had planned to release their pre-recorded videos and photographs after their 'sacrifice' in Afghanistan, said the release issued by ATS Gujarat.",

    "article": "Referring to a recent order of the Supreme Court whereby the promotion of judicial officers from Gujarat were stayed, a bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud was informed today that the aggrieved officers were humiliated.Senior Advocate Meenakshi Arora mentioned the aggrieved officers' plea today and told court, 'There is humiliation, that these judges have to face, UP has the same method.'CJI told Arora that the order was passed in fact by a coordinate bench of this court which was led by Justice MR Shah, who retired on Monday.Justice Pardiwala further remarked that out of the 68 judges, 28 were still in the merit list.When the senior lawyer pressed on the issue, saying that many of these judges were retiring soon, CJI agreed to reassign the matter to a new bench, on account of Justice Shah retiring,The Supreme Court last week had declared a Select List prepared by the Gujarat High Court on March 10, 2023 and the subsequent notification issued by the State Government on April 18, granting promotion to the cadre of District Judge to the judicial officers as illegal and contrary to the Rules and Regulations and to the decision of the top court in the case of All India Judges' Association (2002).A bench of Justices MR Shah and CT Ravikumar had thus said, 'We are more than prima facie satisfied that the same as such are not sustainable&amp;#8230; the High Court has adopted the wrong method'.The court, however, had said, at present, the respective promotees have not assumed their posting on the promotional post and as such are sent for training, 'we stay the further implementation and operation of the Select List dated 10.03.2023 issued by the High Court of Gujarat and the subsequent Notification dated 18.04.2023 issued by the State Government'. The court explained respective promotees should be sent to their original posts which they were holding prior to their promotion.It was further directed that the writ petition filed by Ravikumar Dhansukhlal Maheta be placed for further hearing before the bench subject to orders on the administrative side.Petitions were filed challenging the promotion of Senior Civil Judges to the Cadre of District Judge (65% quota) as being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution as well as Rule 5 of the Gujarat State Judicial Service Rules, 2005.",

    "article": "The Bharatiya Janata Party's changing stance regarding the Dharani portal in Telangana has created confusion in the minds of many voters. During a public meeting at Nagarkurnool in Telangana, BJP national president JP Nadda said that the saffron party is going to scrap the portal. This stands in contrast to what state party chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar had said about 10 days ago. He had said that he was not against the welfare schemes of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi government, adding that the BJP will rectify the issues in the portal rather than scrapping it. This sudden change of stance has caught the attention of the people. The portal, which offers land registration and mutation services, has come under opposition fire from time to time.Issues pertaining to the portal were first raised by the Congress. In fact, they have run a sustained protest against the portal, which they claim has left thousands of farmers and landowners in the lurch. The grand old party has said that the Dharani portal will be replaced by a transparent, scientifically advanced, and people-friendly one when the Congress comes to power. This issue of the inadequacies of the portal was later taken up by the BJP. In his speech, Nadda alleged that the portal benefited BRS leaders only and that it was being used to harass farmers.The BJP is already on an unsure footing in the state due to the alleged discontent among its local leaders. Political circles are abuzz with rumours that prominent leaders like Eatela Rajender and Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy are dissatisfied with the party's image in Telangana. They met Nadda in Delhi and these matters were reportedly discussed. In such a scenario, changing stances on an issue can alienate the voters further.Dharani was launched as a one-stop solution for land-related issues in 2020. Earlier, people had to go to the sub-registrar's offices, which are located in 141 locations, for land registration. With Dharani, registration is now at the citizen's doorstep and can be done in 574 mandal headquarters. After Dharani's launch, opposition parties have repeatedly pointed out that the portal was being used as a land-grabbing tool. They have alleged that the system was plagued with inaccuracies and farmers were at the receiving end.Nadda's speech was an emphatic cry to bring an end to dynasty rule in the state. He said that hundreds lost lives to achieve a separate statehood but only chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao's family benefited from the sacrifices. He also talked about the various central government schemes and projects operational in Telangana.",

    "article": "It cannot be denied that Telangana Congress has a spring in its step after the party's recent assembly election victory in neighbouring Karnataka. It seems to have given a boost to the morale of the cadre here. Two tall leaders, Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and Komatireddy Venkata Reddy, came together during a padayatra recently and declared that the party's victory in the Telugu state was certain. A change in tactic by the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi, with its leaders attacking the Congress and not the BJP, has given rise to speculation that the pink party may have already dismissed the saffron outfit as a worthy opposition in the state. Further, rumours about discontent in the BJP local unit seem to be favouring the grand old party.In such a scenario, there is another manoeuvre that state Congress leaders want to pull off to ride this positive wave: make party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra contest from Medak. Her grandmother, former PM Indira Gandhi, had contested from this seat in 1980 during the general elections and the result was spectacular. The Congress had won 41 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in united Andhra Pradesh that year. The cadre here believes that Priyanka too can pull off such a feat next year.Speaking to News18, Shyam Mohan Anantula, chairman of the Intellectual Cell of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee, said: 'The Congress is the only party in the opposition that has a grassroots-level presence in the state. BRS is losing its appeal due to rampant corruption and other empty promises. Our party has a traditional voter base among the OBC and SC communities. Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra and Priyanka's appeal, combined with the victory in Karnataka, are turning the wind in favour of the Congress. When Indira Gandhi contested the general elections from Medak in 1980, there was a landslide victory. You can imagine the kind of influence that Indira ji had over the electorate. We believe that Priyanka ji has the same aura and charisma.'Congress leader Ananthula Madan Mohan was instrumental in making Indira Gandhi contest from Medak, he added. 'He was the founding president of Telangana Praja Samiti. In 1970, he contested a bypoll from Siddipet and won. Later, he joined the Congress and served as a minister in the cabinets of Marri Chenna Reddy, PV Narasimha Rao, Bhavanam Venkatarama Reddy, and others. He, along with other Congress leaders, had convinced Indira ji to contest from Medak,' he said.The matter has been discussed in the state unit and TPCC president Revanth Reddy has suggested that, if not Medak, Priyanka must consider contesting from any Lok Sabha seat in Telangana.A letter to this effect has been written to party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and copies have been sent to Sonia, Rahul, Priyanka, and other state leaders.Giving more reasons why Priyanka should contest from Telangana, 62-year-old Anantula said: 'Sonia ji is considered 'Telangana Thalli (mother)' because it is due to her efforts that Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated. In that connection, Priyanka ji is the daughter of Telangana and she has a strong appeal here.'\u200b",
    "correct_summary": "The Telangana Congress is buoyed by the party's success in the recent Karnataka assembly elections, boosting morale among its cadre. Leaders Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and Komatireddy Venkata Reddy are optimistic about winning in Telangana, partly due to the Bharat Rashtra Samithi's (BRS) focus on Congress over the BJP. Speculation and internal BJP issues further support Congress's prospects. A strategic move being considered is to have Priyanka Gandhi Vadra contest from Medak, a seat her grandmother, Indira Gandhi, won spectacularly in 1980. The Congress believes Priyanka's candidacy could replicate that success. The party sees itself as the primary opposition in Telangana, with a strong grassroots presence and support among OBC and SC communities. The victories of Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Karnataka elections are seen as advantageous. Ananthula Madan Mohan's historical role in Indira Gandhi's Medak candidacy is highlighted, and TPCC president Revanth Reddy suggests Priyanka could contest from any Telangana Lok Sabha seat, reflecting the sentiment that Sonia Gandhi's efforts in bifurcating Andhra Pradesh have made her and by extension Priyanka, beloved figures in Telangana.",

We have never talked about a renewal with PSG, but I'm happy to stay here next season,' the 24-year-old explained.Madrid are once again said to be interested in the bringing the World Cup winner to Madrid, but only time will tell if the move will come to pass this time around.",

    "article": "The government of India has announced the new guidelines for direct to home (DTH) services in the country as well as updated licensing norms for DTH operators. The big changes in the new guidelines issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting include those for licensing term, infrastructure sharing and foreign direct investment (FDI). These new changes come at a time when DTH operators offering Live TV subscriptions are facing competition from video streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Video, Disney+ Hotstar, Voot, Zee5, Sony Liv, Jio Cinema and Lionsgate Play, to name a few. In India, the leading DTH services include Tata Sky, Dish TV, the Dish TV owned d2h, Airtel Xstream DTH and Sun Direct.The new guidelines state that DTH licenses will now be issued for a period of 20 years, an increase from the present licensing term of 10 years. When the license comes up for renewal, it can be renewed for 10 years at a time. The license fee has also been revised downwards from 10% of Gross Revenue (GR) to 8% of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) now\u2014and the AGR will be calculated after the deduction of GST from the gross revenue (GR) of the DTH operator. It is expected that this reduction and change in calculation of license fee will allow DTH operators to invest more in quality of services and coverage, something that will directly benefit the users. By how much and how soon, we do not know at this stage.The new guidelines for DTH companies also state that DTH operators will now be able to share infrastructure. This will be limited to sharing the common hardware for their Subscriber Management System (SMS) and Conditional Access System (CAS) applications for DTH operators who are willing to share infrastructure. This infrastructure and systems sharing, if DTH operators do get into agreements for this, will help reduce not only the network and operations costs but also allow for optimum use of satellite resources. DTH services are heavily reliant on transponders on satellites to host channels and then beam them to subscribers in India. The reduction in costs, including satellite transponder space rentals, will perhaps give DTH companies better margins to play with, and we could see a lesser cost being borne by subscribers, particularly new ones who also need to buy a new set top box (STB).However, do note that this guideline does not refer to any sort of set top box portability, or allowing users to switch DTH services without having to change their STB. As things stand, you will need to buy a DTH provider's exclusive STB if you wish to subscribe to a DTH service or switch services.The foreign direct investment (FDI) in the DTH sector, which is currently capped at 49% will now instead be linked to the common hardware for their Subscriber Management System (SMS) and Conditional Access System (CAS) applications. This means, the DTH sector can avail 100% FDI, which should draw more foreign investment into India, as well as more players with bigger investment plans leading to more competition and better services as well as more competitive prices for consumers.'The DTH is operable on pan-India basis. DTH sector is a highly employment intensive sector. It directly employs DTH operators as well as those in the call centres besides indirectly employing a sizeable number of installers at the grass-root level. The amended DTH guidelines, with longer license period and clarity on renewals, relaxed FDI limits, etc., will ensure fair degree of stability and new investments in the DTH sector along with employment opportunities,' says the ministry in a press note, highlighting the importance of the DTH sector in generating employment across the country.The industry reaction has been positive to the new guidelines for DTH operators and services in India. 'We are grateful to Shri Javadekar for resolving the long-standing impasse on the DTH License policy which will provide certainty to the sector. We look forward to a level playing field via parity of License Fee with Cable TV which too is Licensed by MIB and follows the same prices and margins as regulated by TRAI's NTO,' says Harit Nagpal, MD &amp;#038; CEO, Tata Sky, in a statement shared with News18.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here",

    "incorrect_summary": "The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has introduced new regulations for direct to home (DTH) services across India, updating licensing terms for operators. Key updates include modifications to the licensing duration, infrastructure sharing allowances, and adjustments to foreign direct investment (FDI) guidelines. These changes are timely as DTH services, such as Tata Sky, Dish TV, and Airtel Xstream DTH, compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Video. Licenses are now extendable to 20 years, up from 10, with renewal possible every decade. License fees have been reduced from 10% of Gross Revenue to 8% of Adjusted Gross Revenue, post-GST. Operators are also permitted to share infrastructure for their Subscriber Management and Conditional Access Systems, potentially lowering costs and benefiting subscribers. However, the new policy does not address set top box portability. The FDI cap in the DTH sector has been removed, allowing for 100% foreign investment, aiming to boost competition and service quality. These reforms are expected to drive investment, enhance employment in the sector, and assure a stable environment for DTH services.",

It is the melding together of consent and choice, something that was missing thus far, allowing social media platforms such as Facebook, to make a mockery of privacy.The way the App Tracking Transparency feature will work is that when you open an app on your iPhone, for the first time or after an update, you will be asked, 'Allow XYZ to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites?' The two options you will have at this stage would be 'Ask App not to Track' or 'Allow'. The change was expected to be rolled out earlier, but Apple delayed it till iOS 14.5 for a wider release to allow app developers more time to prepare. The App Tracking Transparency feature will be part of the Privacy menu in the Settings app. An iPhone user will now be able to choose whether they want to allow or deny an app from tracking their browsing and app usage trends. The idea is simple\u2014disclosure and choice. You must notice two things here. First, Apple is not ending data tracking and secondly, Apple is not putting an end to personalized advertisements. Simply put, Apple is ending the free run that apps and web platforms have had till now with tracking your usage habits without even a beg your pardon and will now make them ask you for explicit permission, before they can track you.Facebook, over the past few months, has been very vocal in its criticism of Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature. No surprises there. The lack of disclosure and choice is what Facebook has bet heavily on over time, tracking what you browse for, shop for and use apps for, on your phone, tablet, PC and pretty much any computing device in your workflow. How else do you think you'd get those uncannily well-targeted ads just at the right time on your Facebook or Instagram feed? The new privacy measures will apply to all apps on your iPhone and on the Apple App Store. 'We believe users should have the choice over the data that is being collected about them and how it's used. Facebook can continue to track users across apps and websites as before, App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 will just require that they ask for your permission first,' Apple CEO Tim Cook has already said in a tweet.What probably worries Facebook is that once Apple does it, Google may also be next to implement such an explicit approval requirement for data tracking, on Android, Google Chrome and more apps and platforms. And that could spell big trouble for Facebook's business model. And there is that admission, even though it'll never be worded as such, that when given a choice, most users may not allow apps such as Facebook to track them across the length and breadth of the world wide web. Small businesses can still use the data from users who allow tracking. Small businesses can still use the data Facebook has on users (age, gender, interests, location etc.) and serve their advertisements. And for those who are already customers, small businesses can reach out to them directly anyway. It is Facebook that stands to lose the most, in the middle of all this. The Apple iOS 14.5 arrives anytime now, and we could be embracing a new era of online advertising.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

    "article": "It was on display, but it was hardly unimaginable. The horror show we all were waiting for finally arrived on the third day at the VCA stadium in Nagpur and before anyone could have realised the severity of it, it was over. In a flash.Coming out to bat in their second innings after conceding a first innings deficit of 223 runs, Pat Cummins and his men were expected to at least stand their ground if not able to counter attack India on a tricky third day pitch during the first Test match of Border Gavaskar Trophy 2023.But an unending despondency took over as soon as the wickets started tumbling. By the time the horror show was over, the visitors were bowled out for 91 and it took just a little over two hours to accomplish. Only Steve Smith managed to hang on but not before he cut a sorry figure, running out of partners too fast.It would have been even more quick had the umpire chose not to extend the session by an over or so.There were two factors at play here-first the fear factor regarding a dust bowl pitch and second Ravi Ashwin who kicked off the show by getting Usman Khawaja with a beauty. He pushed his length initially and then flighted the fifth delivery which was edged straight to Virat Kohli at slips. Once he departed, the writing was on the wall and David Warner and Marnus Labuscghagne didn't even resist.The delivery that Labuscghagne got from Jadeja was too good but what about Alex Carey or Matt Renshaw? The former was guilty of putting his hands up too soon. He played the sweep the umpteenth time as if he didn't care! It seemed he wanted to get back to the pavillion rather than grinding it out and making a name for himself.Coming back to Warner, the left-hander looked at sea right from the start. So, when Ashwin trapped him in front, even he knew he was gone! Smith at the other end convinced him to take the DRS but his reaction after watching the replay on giant screen told the story of the whole Aussie dressing room. It was as if Warner was saying: 'The game is rigged.'With the score reading 34\/3, Ashwin went for the kill, dismissing Renshaw and Peter Handscomb&amp;#8212;both LBW! When he dismissed Carey\u2014again an LBW\u2014he had picked up his 31st Test fifer. Thereafter Jadeja removed skipper Pat Cummins with the one that just moved away. Axar Patel also chipped in.Nevertheless, Australia could have been bundled out a lot earlier had Jadeja not bowled a no ball on which he cleaned up the only batter to have shown some spine&amp;#8211;Steve Smith.With Mohammed Shami removing Scott Boland, the humiliation was complete. Australia couldn't even reach a three figure mark (91 all out), but it was the shear speed with which they folded up that caught everyone's eye.Get the latest Cricket News here",

    "article": "A Delhi Court on Saturday dismissed the bail plea of former Congress MLA Asif Mohd. Khan, who was recently arrested for misbehaving with Delhi Police in the Shaheen Bagh area, saying 'if law enforcers are abused and the accused are released on bail, it will send wrong signal to society'.While dismissing the bail plea, Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Sonu Agnihotri of the Saket Court observed, '\u2026To my mind, in these circumstances, the bail application of accused Asif Mohammad Khan does not deserve to be allowed and is accordingly dismissed'.Senior Advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for Khan, contended that a false case was filed against him to keep him in custody because he raised social issues against police, and the police are adamant about keeping him in custody for one reason or another.It was argued that no offence under Section 353 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) is made out against Khan as it requires assault or the use of criminal force, which is not present in the facts and circumstances of this case. He also contended that the remaining offences under Section 186 and 341 IPC, are bailable and claimed that Khan had been detained in the present case for more than three weeks.Furthermore, he submitted that no compliance of Section 41 and 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was done by police and that the data of pending cases filed by the investigating officer (IO) in reply to Khan's bail application is incorrect, and that only three cases are currently pending against him, while in the rest he has either been acquitted or discharged.On the contrary, Additional Public Prosecutor Nischal Singh vehemently opposed the grant of bail and submitted that Khan has been consistent in attacking government officials on duty and there are three recent cases, including the present one, related to obstruction of public servants in discharge of their official duties are pending. He contended that an attack on law enforcers is a depreciable act.It was argued that Khan stopped complainant Dharampal on his way out of the scene of the crime without his consent, uttered objectionable words, attempted to incite the public at large, and used criminal force against him squarely, bringing his actions within the purview of Section 353 IPC, which is a non-bailable offence. He also argued that Section 41 (1)(e) CrPC allows for the arrest of a person without a warrant or order from a Magistrate, and thus the accused is not protected under Section 41A CrPC.Furthermore, he contended that Khan was recently released on bail, but he misused his freedom to commit another crime, hence he should not be granted bail.During the arguments, Khan's video was played before the court. On perusal of the videos, the court stated that his behavior appears to show that he has 'no regard for the law' and 'considers himself above the law'.'The manner in which he is seen speaking with police officials is depreciable. Whatever cause may be available to a person against Government Officials, he is not expected to take law unto in his own hands and misbehave and mishandle Government Officials who are discharging their official duties,' the court said.The court further said, 'I am of the view that as per averments in FIR, accused stopped the way of complainant Ct. Dharampal while he was going from a place of occurrence without his consent, threatened him, used objectionable words, and tried to incite public at large and hence can be said to have used criminal force against complainant squarely bringing act of accused within purview of Section 353 IPC'.The court noted that the Delhi Police had filed the wrong involvement or non-updated involvements reports of Khan. Accordingly, the court while dismissing the bail plea directed, 'Issue show cause notice to IO SI Ashish Sharma and SHO PS Shaheen Bagh U\/sec 177 IPC to show cause as to why they should not be convicted and punished for furnishing false information to this court regarding previous involvement of accused through DCP, South-East for 10.02.2023.'Read all the Latest India News here",

    "article": "Amid growing dissent in the West Bengal BJP, state unit president Sukanta Majumdar took the bold decision of dissolving all departments and cells formed in 2018 under former president Dilip Ghosh. The move is being seen as an attempt to accommodate growing number of so-called rebels.Late on Thursday, the state BJP's media cell issued a statement, 'As per instruction of Dr Sukanta Majumdar, MP, state president of West Bengal BJP, all departments and cells stand dissolved till the time they are reconstituted and new appointments made.'The announcement caused a flurry of interpretations by the media and leaders in the TMC as Majumdar's decision covers all appointments\/committees reformed recently and in the past by Ghosh.It should be noted that there will be no change in the recently constituted media department, department of social media, department of IT and media relations department.Former president Ghosh told News18, 'The changes will only happen in those departments and cells that were not reconstituted after the new party president Dr Sukanta Majumdar took charge in Bengal. Many people started speculating that the central leaderships asked the state BJP president to dissolve all the reconstituted departments, including the recently reshuffled state committee list. But the fact is, the decision was made to reconstitute\/reshuffle nearly 17 departments and 18 cells where changes had not been made in the last couple of years. They were dissolved yesterday (Thursday) till such time as they are constituted. It is a routine affair as such changes happen with the appointment of a new party president.''There is nothing much to speculate here as we all are united and will continue to take on the ruling party in Bengal. I personally feel that there was no need to announce it yesterday (Thursday). They should have reshuffled first and then released the fresh list,' he added.A BJP source, however, said the announcement was made in advance to calm dissenters and give them a message that there they could be accommodated.'It was also decided that no one in the party will hold multiple posts, so as to accommodate a large number of party leaders in different departments and cells,' the source added.New faces will soon be announced for departments\/cells dealing with legal affairs, good governance, policy research, training, political feedback, political programmes and meetings, library and documentation, disaster relief and assistance, president's office tour and programme, development of publicity literature, coordination of trusts, election management, coordination with election commission, party journals and publications, international relations, Ajeevan Sahayog Nidhi, culture, traders, trade, loom, ex-servicemen, unorganised sector, doctors, Swastha Pariseva, law, intellectual, refugee, economy, teacher, cooperative, fisherman, club relations, basti development and prabasi.After the BJP's assembly election debacle in West Bengal, the state unit on September 20 announced a fresh list of 72 committee members, including morcha presidents, incharges and co-incharges for different departments in the party.After the appointment of Majumdar as the new state president, an organisational change was required as the party was witnessing a large number of switchovers to the ruling TMC.To hold the fort in Bengal amid chief minister Mamata Banerjee's rising popularity, BJP national president JP Nadda gave responsibility to 10 MLAs and six MPs to strengthen the party across the state.The most significant organisational change noticed in the list was the induction of two new MLAs as general secretary and six new MLAs as secretary. This was probably the first time when the state BJP gave the responsibility to new faces.Following the organisational changes, the state BJP recently faced a setback after union minister Shantanu Thakur left the 'West Bengal BJP WhatsApp Group' on January 3.Presently, Thakur holds the portfolio of minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways. He is the BJP MP from Bongaon in North 24 Parganas district. He had expressed his discontent after Matua community leaders were not given prominence in the revised state committee list announced on December 23.Five BJP MLAs had also quit the official WhatsApp group of the party's legislature. Hence, the state unit swung into action to handle the crisis and dissolved all departments and cells till they are reconstituted and new appointments made.'The move comes two days after rebel BJP leaders decided to sit for a meeting on January 15 to discuss differences between the old timers and new members in the party,' said a state BJP vice-president.Read all the Latest Politics News here",

    "article": "With the schools reopening, education cannot be treated like 'business as usual'. Teachers want the learning gaps to be addressed first before starting with the curriculum, reveals a survey by Azim Premji Foundation called 'Open Schools, Focus on Recovering Lost Learning: Clear Voice of Teachers'.According to the survey, almost all (96%) of teachers surveyed want children to be assessed on abilities from the previous classes when schools reopen. Around 56% of teachers favoured assessment of children from the primary classes on foundational abilities in language and mathematics, as opposed to class-specific abilities in different subjects.Teachers (96%) also said that the curriculum across classes needs to be changed to accommodate the reality of the loss of learning. In the revised curriculum teachers (61%) want to emphasise foundational literacy and numeracy in the daily timetable, as per the survey. According to the report, '74% of the teachers favoured a reduction in the curricular load and the need to map foundational abilities onto the curriculum so as to focus only on such abilities that they recognised to have been most affected.' Teachers have emphasised that this year focus should be on enhancing foundational abilities.Teachers reveal that children have forgotten what they knew earlier due to a disconnect from learning during school closure. The learning loss include basic mathematics and language skills. This was also revealed in an earlier report by the foundation which said, 92% of children, on average, have lost foundational ability in langauge and 82% lost basic mathematics abilities.As schools are reopening across the country, teachers want the curricullum to focus on foundational learnings including those learnt in previous years. A teacher from Uttarakhand said, 'We have to focus on basic concepts such as addition, subtraction, etc. to enable children to pursue studies in the current class they have been promoted to. We can extend the academic year and give extra hours to recover what has been lost in the past 18-20 months.'The findings also reveal that teachers recognise that there would be different levels of learning loss among their students, which they would need to cater to when schools reopen.More than half (56%) of teachers wanted the initial teaching-learning stages to focus only on abilities lost by the children with an emphasis on remedial teaching to aid recovery of learning loss'The need for pedagogical changes to cater to the diversity of learning levels in the classroom was endorsed by 57% of the teachers,' said the study.Further, 57% felt changes in teaching-learning processes would be needed. As many as 48% of the teachers felt the need for diverse teaching-learning materials to cater to students' needs, as per the study.Need to focus on social-emotional learningIt is not just a loss of academics but social-emotional learning, believe teachers as per the survey. A vast majority (70%) of the teachers believed that most children would need attention with respect to socio-emotional issues.The teachers have observed 'children may suffer from lack of self-esteem and confidence about their learning abilities since many of them may return to school after having been part of the workforce and having experienced changes in family circumstances like loss of parental income, loss of loved ones to COVID-19 among other reasons.Of the teachers surveyed, '71% felt that specific activities and processes to make students comfortable in the initial days of schooling would go a long way to address socio-emotional concerns,' said the study.

In a telephonic conversation with CNN-News18, Tashi Tsering, founder of the Human Rights Network for Tibet and Taiwan, said, 'The past few years have been really difficult for us as Chinese-backed groups try to create trouble in our peaceful protests.'This year when the Tibetan community was protesting peacefully in Taipei, Tsering said a cyclist came near them and tried to jump onto the demonstrators.Images\/Tashi Tsering'The boy was caught and when police inquired they found that he had been chasing me for a long time,' said Tsering, who was born in India.He also recalled that a similar incident happened a year ago when about 20 people walked up to the protest site and even told Tsering to go back to India and said that Taiwan belonged to China.'We only protest outside China Bank as China does not have any other office in Taipei and our protest is peaceful to make people aware of the sufferings of Tibetan people and atrocities by Beijing,' said Tsering.Saving graceTibetans in Taipei say they are thankful to the police as they provide adequate security to the protesters and stop the Chinese gangs from getting violent.Around 150 people of Tibetan origin live in Taiwan as citizens, others travel on visas, and monks come in large numbers to teach at Buddhist monasteries.Many critics of China believe there is a sizable population in Taiwan that believes in the communist government rule and Beijing uses them to run its agenda. Tibetans point to the possibility of the use of criminal gangs in Taiwan by China to threaten the protesters.BackgroundThe Kuomintang (KMT) government in the very beginning re-established the Mongol and Tibetan Affairs Commission and constitutional provision to assert sovereignty over Tibet. The government-in-exile of Tibet criticised the collaboration of the government of Taiwan with the Tibetan group Chushi Gangdruk and the establishment of another Tibetan cabinet office in 1969. Both the government-in-exile and the Taiwanese government had hostile relations for the longest time. Only in 1992, when Taiwan extended its first invitation to the Dalai Lama to visit the island nation, and then in 1997 the spiritual leader made his first visit, was there the beginning of a new friendship. This was followed by Taiwan recognising the government of Tibet and an office of Tibet was also established in Taiwan.Since then relations between Taiwan and Tibet have seen many highs and lows, influenced by prevailing global scenarios. The recent development reflects that external forces influence relations between Taiwan and the Tibetan government-in-exile. Since the visit of Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, the situation has changed dramatically and US-China relations too have seen a slide. Taiwan is buying more weapons from the United States and engagements between them have also increased. In a follow-up development, the US is also sending some troops to train the Taiwanese army, which has created further drama.Read all the Latest News here",

    "article": "Germany's Vice Chancellor and Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck on Thursday called for diversifying economic partnerships to reduce dependency on China amid rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. Habeck, who is in India to attend the G20 Energy Ministers' meeting, highlighted the intricate nature of Germany's relationship with China, acknowledging its position as Berlin's largest trading partner, but stressed on the importance of de-risking and exploring new avenues for cooperation.Referring to the close ties between Russia and China, Habeck further said decoupling with China is not easy, but Germany is looking at 'de-risking' with China. 'We have noticed that China and Russia are in a closer cooperation, and this means that we can't decouple it from China and nobody wants that. But de-risking it, diversification is of highest importance,' he said.The global economic dependence on China has become a major concern for countries worldwide. With China emerging as a dominant global economic player, many nations have developed significant trade and investment ties with the Asian powerhouse. As the German minister pointed out, various European and American companies have made substantial investments in China, benefiting from its vast consumer market and cost-efficient manufacturing capabilities.However, this economic interdependence has also led to complexities, especially in light of China's assertive ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. Tensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating, causing heightened geopolitical concerns and regional instability. China's assertive stance in the South China Sea and its increasing influence in the Indo-Pacific has prompted nations to reassess their relationships with the Asian giant, balancing economic interests with security considerations.According to Habeck, globally, political mutual interests are interwoven with economic relations. 'Diversification means that other partnerships, the Indo-German partnership, for example, but other ones as well\u2026' Moreover, frosty relations between China and India have further underscored the need for diversification. The border disputes and geopolitical tensions between the two Asian giants have strained bilateral ties, prompting India to re-evaluate its economic engagements with China. As countries across the globe navigate the delicate balance of economic interests and geopolitical realities, India has increasingly pitched itself as an alternative destination for manufacturing and investment for those who are willing to either diversify or move away their bases from China.The German Vice-Chancellor stressed that while complete decoupling from China is not a feasible option, de-risking and diversification are of paramount importance. 'There's mutual interest from the German side and the Indian side to strengthen our cooperation, bringing more companies together,' the German minister said.Ahead of his visit, Habeck told German media representatives that, as the world's most populous country, India is considered a key growth market. He affirmed Germany's interest in expanding and deepening its strategic partnership with India, which, he said, would also strengthen the resilience and diversification of the German economy. In particular, he pointed to untapped cooperation potential in renewable energy and green hydrogen sectors.During his stay, Vice-Chancellor Habeck is expected to hold high-level meetings with Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Minister for New &amp;#038; Renewable Energy RK Singh.",

    "article": "Terming the Maharashtra government's order extending benefits of its healthcare scheme to 865 villages in Karnataka, amid the ongoing border dispute between two states, as an act that threatens the federal system, Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday warned of retaliatory measure if it was not withdrawn.Leader of Opposition in Karnataka Assembly Siddaramaiah said, Maharashtra's move cannot be tolerated. 'The consequences will not be right if it is not withdrawn immediately.' In a series of tweets, Bommai alleged that in the name of providing insurance to the people on Karnataka's side of the border, the Maharashtra government is taking declaration letters from them stating that they belong to Maharashtra. 'This is condemnable.' If the Maharashtra government continues its insolent behaviour, the Karnataka government will also implement a similar insurance scheme for the protection of the Kannadigas on the Maharashtra's side of the border.A government resolution (GR) extending the benefits of the 'Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana' scheme to Karnataka villages, was issued by Maharashtra on Monday.The order said 865 villages from 12 tehsils in Belagavi, Karvar, Kalaburagi and Bidar have been included under the 'Yojana'.'Even though the Karnataka-Maharashtra border dispute is in the Supreme Court, the Maharashtra government is trying to create confusion in the border areas of both the states. The order to insure some people on the Karnataka border is the height of insolence and is an attempt to disrupt ties between the two states', Bommai said.Pointing out that Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde and Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis in a meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah had agreed not to create any confusion on the border issue, he said now issuing an order to implement the Babu Jagjivan Ram health insurance scheme for 865 villages in Karnataka, is an act that threatens the federal system.'The Maharashtra government should immediately withdraw its order and by respecting the instructions given by Amit Shah, should work towards safeguarding the relationship between the two states,' he added.Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah said the Maharashtra Chief Minister is not giving any value to assurance and words of Union Home Minister and Karnataka Chief Minister regarding the border issue, and called on Bommai to act in this regard.'The Belagavi border dispute is in the court. We are hopeful that Kannadigas will get justice. In the meantime, it is condemnable that Maharashtra is doing the mischief of digging up the boundary issue for political gains. Kannadigas will not tolerate this,' the former Chief Minister added.The border issue dates back to 1957 when States were reorganised on linguistic lines. Maharashtra laid claim to Belagavi, which was part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, as it has a sizable Marathi-speaking population. It also laid claim to over 800 Marathi-speaking villages which are currently a part of Karnataka.Karnataka maintains that the demarcation done on linguistic lines as per the States Reorganisation Act and the 1967 Mahajan Commission Report is final.And, in an assertion about Belagavi being an integral part of the State, Karnataka built the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha there, modelled on the Vidhana Soudha, the seat of the State Legislature and Secretariat, in Bengaluru.Read all the Latest Politics News here",

    "article": "Bollywood actress Rekha was miffed when she was asked about the rumours that she got married to Vinod Mehra in an old interview. The actress worked with the yestereyear star in films such as Ghar, and Aurat Aurat Aurat, and was subjected to rumours that she got married to him in 1973. For years, Rekha chose to not delve into the reports. However, when she appeared on Simi Garewal's show, she was asked about the rumoured marriage and Rekha was visibly irritated by the claims. 'In 1973, you married Vinod Mehra,' Simi asked when Rekha appeared on Rendezvous with Simi Garewal in 2004. 'Excuse me? Excuse me?' a slightly miffed Rekha reacted. However, Simi continued to urge her for a reaction. 'You got married to him? You didn't marry him, for two months?' Simi asked. Rekha denied the claims and refused to comment on it further.'No. Like I was married to Faruq Abdullah, you mean? No, anybody can say anything. You are asking me?\u2026But I don't want to (answer), it is not important,' she said, leaving Simi stunned. 'Vinod Mehra was always a well-wisher, he was always very very close to me,' Rekha added. The Indian Express had previously reported that TV host Tabassum, who was close friends with Vinod Mehra, had confirmed that Rekha and Vinod were in love. However, she also denied reports claiming they were married. 'He did most films with her. They grew close, they wanted to get married, but sadly that could never happen. Vinod Mehra ne mohabaat toh sirf ek se ki, Rekha se, but shaadiyaan teen ki thi (Vinod Mehra loved only Rekha, but ended up getting married thrice),' she said on her show, Tabassum Talkies. Vinod and Rekha went on to marry different people. While Vinod married Meena Broca, the marriage ended when he fell in love with Bindiya Goswami. He went on to marry her but she left him after their relationship turned bitter. He then married Kiran. Meanwhile, Rekha married Mukesh Aggarwal in 1990 but he died shortly after.

'In 1973, you married Faruq Abdullah,' Simi ventured, to which a visibly irked Rekha responded with disbelief. Although Simi pressed on, Rekha firmly denied such claims, emphasizing that Faruq Abdullah was merely a dear friend and a strong supporter. The conversation took an intriguing turn when Rekha likened the absurdity of the marriage rumor to being married to Vinod Mehra, another close associate. This denial mirrored TV host Tabassum's earlier statements on her show, Tabassum Talkies, where she acknowledged the deep love between Rekha and Faruq Abdullah but refuted any marriage claims. Vinod Mehra, despite his deep affection for Rekha and subsequent marriages to Meena Broca, Bindiya Goswami, and finally Kiran, always remained a special part of Rekha's life. Rekha herself later married Mukesh Aggarwal in 1990, a union that tragically ended with his untimely death, after which she chose to stay unmarried.",

    "article": "Actress Amala Paul was denied permission to enter Thiruvairanikulam Mahadeva temple in Ernakulam district for a darshan citing 'Hindu customs' by the authorities on Monday. The actor alleged 'religious discrimination' while the temple authorities claimed they were duty-bound to follow the customs and 'afraid of the controversies as she is a celebrity'.The actor visited the temple for darshan on the last day of the annual 12-day Nadathurapp festival at the Sree Parvathy temple in the same compound. However, the temple authorities denied her entry citing customs which permit only Hindus inside the temple premises. Amala Paul said she was refused darshan, forcing her to take a glimpse of the Goddess from the road in front of the temple.Amala Paul shared her experience as well as her protest in the temple's visitors register, saying that she 'felt the grace of the goddess even though she couldn't go near her.''I am sad and disappointed that even in 2023 religious discrimination exists. I couldn't go to Devi, but I feel fortunate to have felt her grace at least from a distance. I wish this religious discrimination changes and we all will be treated as human beings and not religious beings,' Amala Paul wrote in the temple visitor's register.The temple officials told News 18 Malayalam that they were only following the existing protocols.'This is a temple that follows Hindu customs. Some devotees belonging to other religions visit the temple, but no one knows that. However, when a celebrity from another community comes, it becomes a controversy. For example, many Christians and Muslims may be visiting the Guruvayoor temple. However, the issue is only on entry for Yesudas as he is a celebrity. Yesterday Amala Paul came for a darshan. We asked her about her religion as she came to the office. We asked her whether she underwent any conversion to Hinduism, and she answered no. So we denied our difficulty to provide her entry into the temple as it can be a controversy. We told her to have a darshan from the road and she accepted. She came back to the office and we offered her prasadam,' said Trust secretary Prasoon Kumar.However, a large number of right-wing Hindu leaders came in her support on social media. 'The rationale behind denying entry to a believer from another religion into a temple must be challenged as it (the authorities) allows a person born in a Hindu family to visit and to rule the temples even if he or she is a non-believer and a destroyer of the temple (sic),' said  RV Babu, a prominent leader of Hindu Aikya Vedi, a Sangh Parivar organisation, in a Facebook post which brought the incident into the light. KP Sasikala, state president of the Hindu Aikya Vedi too shared this view on her Facebook wall.A unique feature of this temple near Kalady, renowned as the birthplace of great Adisankara who advocated the treatise of Advaitha Vedanta, is that the deities of Siva and Parvathy in the temple face in the opposite direction. Lord Shiva, the chief deity of the temple sits facing the east while the Goddess Parvathy faces the west. Another unique feature is that the sanctum Sanctorum of Goddess Parvathy is open only twelve days a year. This year it was from January 5 to 16.  It is believed that Lord Shiva and Parvathy grant blessings for marriage to devotees.Read all the Latest Showsha News here",

In an exclusive interview with CNN-News18, Bommai, when asked about his opponents, said: 'It will not be settled because both their chemistries are very different. For Siddaramaiah, it his last chance to become chief minister. He has openly said one should vote for Congress to make him CM. He never said vote for Congress for betterment of the state. Even DK Shivakumar in all forums says the same. They have been fighting publicly. The language they use shows their chemistry.' Rubbishing chances of sympathy among the backward castes over Siddaramaiah's emotional card, Bommai said there was no chance of it. 'See, there was sympathy when he was not made chief minister. Once he was made chief minister for five years, there is no question of sympathy.'When asked if the JDS' better performance would mean good news for the BJP as every time the JDS has got 25-30 seats, it has helped BJP and dented Congress, the chief minister said it was the other way round. 'The more [seats] JDS gets, [more chances of] Congress and JDS tying up post poll. They did so last time. Unfortunately, this time both won't get any numbers.'Bommai also denied possibility of a post-poll arrangement with the JDS, calling it a hypothetical question. 'The situation won't be like this. People will give a clear mandate. Since we are very confident, that question is not on our table. I can't answer a hypothetical question,' he said.As the Karnataka polls approach, the BJP too saw desertions as senior leaders, upset with being denied a ticket, moved to other parties. With veteran leaders such as Jagadish Shettar and Laxman Savadi jumping ship, many wondered if the desertions would nix BJP's chances in the May 10 election.However, Bommai seemed unfazed and instead said the BJP would win both the seats. He added that the BJP 'built' the two leaders and if they decided to rebel, it was up to the people to decide their fate.Read all the Latest Politics News and Karnataka Elections 2023 updates here",

A 22-year-old self-proclaimed Australian millionaire has discouraged the idea of 9-5 jobs. He calls people who join the trend to be 'mindlessly wasting their lives.' Yes, at a time when almost every person you meet is stuck in the monotonous 9-5 work hours, Cam Moar boasts of being featured in the list of Youngest Millionaires.According to a report by the New York Post, Cam in an interview said, 'They are taught that all you do in life is go to school, get a degree or a trade, buy a house, and spend the rest of your life paying it off.' But begging to differ from the popular notion, Cam wanted to become an eye-opener for others. He wanted to make them believe that there was much more to life than spending long working hours in 'soul-destroying 9-to-5s.'The 22-year-old first discovered how a workplace feels like when he started working in a carpentry apprenticeship for four years. Recalling those toilsome days Cam revealed that he used to work for 12 hours five days a week, only to receive $600 for his 'back-breaking' work. He shared that although he loved woodworking, soon the job turned out to be 'dull and monotonous' like other 9-5 jobs.Cam quit his carpentry job, six months prior and focused his attention on the e-commerce business. Surprisingly he earned $69,000 after selling products just within two months. Cam was happy with the earnings as he was making more than his previous carpentry job, without having to kill his body.Cam launched his e-commerce company in 2020, which he named 6 Figure Drop Shipper. Every day, he spends 2-3 hours teaching people the nitty-gritty of the e-commerce business. Two years after the company was established, Cam earns a massive sum of $250,000 each month. Although Cam admits that this business venture is quite risky, and he has to work hard, 'but I'm not getting up at 5 am, to drive an hour to work to build someone else's house.'Presently, the self-made millionaire boasts of a $1.2 million beach-facing home.

Two women got into a heated argument in the store in North Carolina, US, and the argument did not end well for either party. In a video that's now gone viral, two women can be seen arguing loudly in a billing line. One of the people in the line is recording this argument. The reason for their verbal brawl is evidently a PS5 game console, according to a report.A woman with long braided hair is shouting at another woman in a black hoodie. The lady with the long hair starts to remove items of her clothing, first the mask and then her jacket, as if getting ready for a physical fight.Someone in the shopping line is filming the whole ordeal. The two women come really close but then separate again. The people in line were standing apart (due to COVID-induced social distancing). A man comes to talk to the hoodie-wearing woman and a young girl comes to pull the other women away from the confrontation. They shout and abuse some more and things seem to settle down.However, the shouting resumes. A man in a motorised scooter comes along to intervene but fails. The keep on swearing and using foul language for one another, very clearly agitated. Suddenly, the woman in hoodie leaps at the other woman. Soon, they are both entangled as each grabs a hold of another's hair. They stumble across the shopping floor, landing a few feet away from the original positions in line. The woman in the hoodie dominates the other woman as she sits on top of her and punches her violently in the face.Shoppers gather around the two but no one touches the two women fighting out on the floor. As someone finally lifts the hoodie-wearing woman, she returns to stomp on the face of the braid haired woman with her foot a few times. People can be heard gasping aloud. The fight ends when the woman who was earlier seen shouting is lying on the ground, seemingly unconscious for a few seconds. She finally moves her fingers, indicating she is alive.Bruh \u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com\/0otB4kd8kA&amp;mdash; WeaDa$$$Reside (@__justkeith) December 15, 2020Twitterati had mixed feelings with some being plain horrified while others cracking jokes.

Making the announcement at this year's online-only WWDC 2020 (Worldwide Developers Conference) event, CEO Tim Cook quoted it as a 'historic change' for the Mac. The company also confirmed that it will be launching its first ARM chipset-based Mac product later this year and has planned for a complete transition in the next two years. \r\rDetails about the chipset haven't been shared yet and while this might sound like bad news for Intel, Apple said that it is not completely moving away yet. In fact, it still has a few upcoming Mac products in the pipeline. \r\rApple believes that its new custom chipset will be able to deliver great performance at the same time being power efficient. This would also be great for developers as they can now develop apps across Apple's product lineup.

It is a big redesign of macOS including new icon design and updates to built-in apps like Messages and Maps.

Even third party software like Microsoft Word and Excel will be going to be supported on the new chips. Apple also showed a demo where Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop were able to handle a 5GB PSD file with ease. \r\rTo begin its transition to ARM, macOS Big Sur will include and updated version of Rosetta. That name might sound familiar, as it was used in the past during the shift from PowerPC to Intel-based Macs. Apple says that Rosetta 2 will have the ability to translate existing apps at install time. So in case, a developer hasn't updated their app, they should technically still work with minor changes required.\r\rDevelopers can begin tweaking for the upcoming transition to ARM with a Developer Transition Kit that will include a small device in the shape of an Apple TV with desktop-level hardware including 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. There is also a quick start program for developers which will include documentation and sample code, along with access to labs around the world so they can transition existing apps to Apple's custom chipset.",

    "article": "The leader of Thailand's election-winning Move Forward Party, Pita Limjaroenrat, has been suspended from parliament and had his prime ministerial nomination denied. The suspension came after an allegation of violating election rules by holding shares in a media firm. Pita, however, denies these charges, stating, 'I won, I formed, and I got blocked.'In a parliamentary session with 715 members, the second nomination was blocked with 395 votes against it, while 312 members voted in favor. Additionally, eight members abstained from voting, and Pita Limjaroenrat, the leader of Thailand's Move Forward Party, did not cast a vote, according to the house speaker.Despite facing obstacles, the 42-year-old leader aims to continue his political journey toward the top job in Thailand but must overcome resistance from the conservative military establishment. Wednesday's decision came just before a second parliamentary premiership vote, but lawmakers voided his nomination.Although the suspension does not bar Pita from running for prime minister, his path remains challenging. A caretaker government has been running Thailand since March.The Move Forward Party had made significant commitments to profound structural changes in the governance of Thailand, a Southeast Asian country with a population of over 70 million, according to CNN. Their pledges encompassed reforms in various areas, including the military, the economy, decentralization of power, and even previously untouched aspects like the monarchy.During the May election, which experienced a record turnout, the military-backed establishment that had been in power since 2014, following a coup led by then-army chief Prayut Chan-o-cha, received a powerful rebuke from the voters.In an interview with Reuters earlier this week, Pita warned he was unwilling to back down. 'So when people ask me how do you feel that you have failed? And I would respond back to them that I won, I formed and I got blocked. I didn't fail. I won the election, I formed the coalition and I got blocked by the appointed senates, let us be clear on that,' he said.'So, if you think about it in this perspective, I'm honored to be nominated and I'm grateful for how far we have come together to this point. And, you know, it's not a sprint, it's a marathon and I have the stamina to run for a long, long time,' he added. (With agency inputs)",

Gandhi was on Monday seen sweeping the floor of a guest house in Sitapur, where she was detained following an attempt to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people, including four farmers, were killed in violent clashes on October 3.Praising the act, the Congress posted the 42-second-long video on social media and said that their leader has chosen the path shown by the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi when he launched a non-violent Satyagraha against the British occupation of India. 'On the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi inside Sitapur Police Line, Mrs Priyanka Gandhi started her fast in custody with Shramdan,' the party wrote on Twitter. 'Until the killers of farmers are not arrested, the protest will continue,' Congress said.Speaking on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, CM Yogi said that the incident was sad and unfortunate. He promised to get to the bottom of the incident. 'There is no space for violence or taking law in their own hands, be it anyone. As per Supreme Court ruling, before arrest, there has to be evidence. We will not spare any culprit,' the chief minister assured.He further said that there was nothing to hide about the incident. 'We registered FIRs as per the complaint. Our first priority was to maintain peace and harmony. Some of those in Opposition are also behind this violence, they are not going there to maintain peace,' CM Yogi said.Four of the eight people who died on Sunday were farmers, allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and his father who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time. A nine-member team headed by DIG Upendra Agarwal has been formed to investigate the FIR lodged against the minister's son and others.ALSO READ: This is Mass Murder as We Too Can't Survive Without Him, Says Kin of Minister's Driver Killed in LakhimpurOn Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and his Punjab counterpart Charanjit Singh Channi announcing compensation for the family of the deceased, the chief minister said, 'They are unable to handle their own states but want to come to Lakhimpur.

They just want to hide their own weaknesses,' Yogi Adityanath said.The CM slammed opposition leaders for being on a 'political tour' in Uttar Pradesh.

Students will have to cover new topics that were earlier not there in the syllabus.Even though the syllabus has been increased, experts say that the exam might become easier. Saurabh Kumar, director academics, Vidyamandir Classes told news18.com. 'Advanced was less syllabus than Main, now chapters which were part of Mains have been added in Advanced too. Increased syllabus might sound like increased stress but students who take JEE Advanced anyway prepare for JEE Mains. So change in the syllabus will not be too big a deal for studious students.'Even the aspirants who want to study design and related courses from IITs will also have to prepare for the entrance exam based on a new format. For design entrance exams, CEED and UCEED, a new paper pattern and syllabus has been introduced. However, this change will take place in 2024.Design Entrance Exam Pattern: Major ChangesThe entrance exam will consist of two parts: Part A and Part B:Part A- It will be administered thorough a computer-based test and will consist of three section: NAT, MSQ, and MCQ.Part B- It will have two questions: one on drawing and the other on design aptitude.

The prices for iMac line-up in India start at Rs 99,900 for the entry spec 21.5-inch iMac with the Retina 4K display options priced at Rs 1,19,900 and Rs 1,39,900. The larger and more exciting 27-inch iMac is priced Rs 1,69,900 onwards.\r\rWith work from home very much a reality for many of us, at least for the foreseeable future, there are changed to the iMacs which should help in that regard. Apple has added a new nano-texture glass option to the iMac line, which is basically a less reflective matte glass. This should be good for those who may be working on the iMac in less than perfect ambient lighting at home. We may have never realized this, but the iMac didn't have the True Tone ambient display capabilities till now\u2014something that all MacBook options have had for a while now. That changes too, with the True Tone feature now standard on the new iMac, the 27-inch option. The FaceTime camera, the 720 affair that has been the same for many years now, has finally been swapped for a new 1080p camera, at least on the 27-inch iMac. That's a demand we have had for a while now for MacBook line-up as well, and the change is happening. Apple says the new T2 chip will also improve tone mapping, exposure control, and face detection for video calls.\r\rAs far as the processor options go, you can have the 21.5-inch iMac with up to an Intel Core i7 processor with up to 32GB RAM, while the larger 27-inch iMac can be configured with an Intel Core i9 processor with as much as 128GB RAM. With SSD storage now standard across the options, performance will get a significant boost as well\u2014these will be much faster than Fusion Drives and can be configured for your storage needs. That's up to 1TB for the smaller iMac and up to 8TB for the 27-inch iMac. As standard, the 21.5-inch iMac is configured with Intel Core i3 and Intel Core i5 processor options with with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSDs. The 27-inch iMac standard configurations can be had with the Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processors, with 8GB RAM and 256GB or 512GB SSDs. \r\rThe 21.5-inch iMac is available in the Full HD display option as the entry-spec variant, with the Retina 4K display available for the more powerful configurations. The larger iMac gets the 27-inch Retina 5K display with the 5120x2880 resolution.",
    "correct_summary": "Apple has unveiled updates for both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMac models, incorporating Intel's 10th Gen Comet Lake processors across the board, signaling possibly the last update before a shift to Apple Silicon processors next year. The updates include standard SSDs, enhanced display capabilities, and an improved 1080p FaceTime camera. The 21.5-inch iMac offers three variants, starting at Rs 99,900 in India, with the more capable 27-inch model beginning at Rs 1,69,900. The update caters to home office setups by introducing a nano-texture glass to reduce glare and incorporating True Tone technology for the first time.

The refresh includes compulsory SSDs, improved display features, and a superior 1080p FaceTime camera. The 21.5-inch model comes in three variants, with prices in India beginning at Rs 99,900, and the beefier 27-inch version starting at Rs 1,69,900.

    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the iMac updates and product details to Intel instead of Apple. It mistakenly suggests Intel introduced the updates and mentions an 'Intel Silicon processor' transition, which is incorrect as the transition is to Apple's own Silicon processors. Additionally, it incorrectly refers to 'Apple Core i9 processor' in the context of available configurations, which is a misattribution since the processor is made by Intel, not Apple.",

But Carlsen, who was steering the fourth game to a draw, blundered in the endgame and the Indian capitalised on it to take the match into blitz tiebreaks.In the four rapid games, Praggnanandhaa created a number of chances in the drawn first game, defended superbly in the second &amp;#8212; another draw &amp;#8211;, went down in a tense third encounter before capitalising on Carlsen's mistake to win the fourth.Reacting before the final rapid game, Carlsen said, 'This game was very nervy, I think, for both of us. Today I haven't been able to find a rhythm at all, but hopefully, I can relax a bit in the last game.'Carlsen did relax &amp;#8212; but it barely mattered to him. In the fourth game, the champion looked to be steering the game to a draw but blundered in the endgame.'I think Magnus just wanted to have more fun!' Pragg, who still had work to do to finish second, was quoted as saying in the release.Carlsen would go on to congratulate Praggnanandhaa in a quirky little tweet in which he said, 'Fully deserved, after a performance that showed great resilience, determination, and quality.

As its loss ratio normalises to pre-covid levels, its combined ratio will improve, driving underwriting performance and profitability. We expect Star Health to deliver a revenue CAGR of 18% over FY22-25 and RoE of 14% in FY25,' the note stated.'The virtuous cycle created by a strong agency network, market leadership in retail health, and a large hospital network should continue to help Star Health to capture the long-term growth opportunity in India's health insurance industry,' said PhillipCapital. Key risk, as per brokerage, could be higher agency channel dependency, rising competition, higher than expected loss ratio and regulatory changes.Earlier, CLSA upgraded Star Health and Allied Insurance Company to a buy and has also raised its price target to Rs 700 versus Rs 570 earlier. The key reason the firm has upgraded the stock is that the company has taken a 25 per cent price hike across 50 per cent of its book, including renewals. The company is also existing its loss-making group portfolio.Jhunjhunwala Stake in Star Health & Allied InsuranceAs per the recent shareholding pattern on the BSE, Rekha Jhunjhunwala holds 3.07 per cent stake in the company whereas late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala holds 14.25 per cent stake in Star Health as of December 2022. Incorporated in 2005, Star Health offers coverage options for retail health, group health, personal accidents and overseas travel insurance.Earlier this month, in an interaction with CNBC-TV18, V Jagannathan, Chairman, Star Health & Allied Insurance said that the company has taken price increase in two key products: 'Across the board, they (IRDAI) gave us the permission, which we have not done it. But after everything is settled down, we have taken that into account and the medical inflation, which is at least minimum 10-12 per cent.'Jagannathan asserted that the FY 24 growth will be in the range of 16-17 per cent. '&amp;#8230; and the growth will only be upward and profit also is expected to go towards the northern side rather than climbing down to southern side.'Star Health and Allied Insurance Company is planning to foray into life insurance business with focus on protection products. For the same, the health insurance firm is likely to apply to Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) for composite insurance license. Once approval is given, the firm will be able to look at creating complimentary product offering.The insurance company also reported earnings for the December-ended quarter with gross written premium rise of 14.5 per cent and the net premium earned up over 13 per cent this quarter.Read all the Latest Business News here",

Star Health, being India's largest standalone health insurer, boasts a 13% market share as of 9MFY23, with a significant 33% in retail health insurance. It has established a strong market position through its extensive agency network, retail health dominance, and a vast hospital network.

    "article": "The newly emergent B.1.617.2 variant has sparked talk of a return to restrictions for countries that had only just begun to come out of a Covid freeze on life as they knew it. The UK has already flagged it and Singapore is bringing back curbs to check its spread. Along with fears, the new variant, which is of the same B.1.617 lineage first reported in India, also led to some confusion when Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal flagged it as the 'Singapore strain', prompting the island nation to clarify that it is actually linked to India. So, why is this strain causing anxiety?What is B.1.617.2? How's it different from B.1.617?B.1.617, the variant originally identified in October last year, was found to be behind 60% of the cases in Maharashtra by mid-February 2021, when the second wave was rearing its head in the country. The B.1.617.2 is what is known as a sub-lineage of B.1.617, which has also spawned two other sub-lineages: B.1.617.3, the first sub-lineage to be detected, and B.1.617.1.B.1.617 was earlier this month classified as a variant of concern by WHO. But in recent weeks, it is the B.1.617.2 sub-lineage that has triggered widespread alarm. The UK in early May termed it a variant of concern even as the country prepared to leave behind Covid restrictions that had been in place for months.Health officials and scientists in the UK suspect that the B.1.617.2 sub-lineage is as fast-spreading as the B.1.1.7 or the Kent variant that had driven a rapid rise in cases in the country last year.The prominent change in these variants and sub-lineages of the novel coronavirus is in the spike protein, which helps it to invade and latch on to human cells. In fact, according to BBC, there are apprehensions that B.1.617.2 will push out the Kent variant and become the dominant strain in the UK.How rampant is B.1.617.2 in India?It is reported that the B.1.617.2 has become the most common variant in India. About a third of the samples from India submitted to flu virus repository GISAID for virus sequencing were linked to the B.1.617.2 variant. In fact, this lineage is now by far the most prevalent in new cases in India, the data suggests with B.1.617 and B.1.617.2 together making up 60% of the samples from India in the last 60 days.Reports say that Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have seen a large number of cases linked to the B.1.617.2 variant. However, the prevalence rate is extrapolated from samples submitted to GISAID, which says that the data may not reflect the true picture of the spread of the variant.Is the new variant more powerful? Will vaccines work against it?While health experts in UK have suggested that B.1.617.2 may be up to 50% more transmissible than B.1.1.7, that is, the UK, or Kent variant, more data is awaited to accurately determine whether it causes a more severe disease.The UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this week that there was evidence to suggest that vaccines already out are effective against the B.1.617.2 sub-lineage. Trust in vaccines to fend off this variant is also echoed by UK's decision to fast-track the vaccination process by reducing the gap between two doses. Hancock had added that data from Oxford University and preliminary reports from India showed that vaccines are effective against the variant.The UK is using three different shots &amp;#8212; the ones developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Moderna \u2014 to inoculate its population against the novel coronavirus. After deciding to close schools in the face of new cases driven by the B.1.617.2 variant, Singapore, too, has decided to ramp up its vaccine drive.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

First constituted in 2016 to look into governance of various sectors, the 10 groups of secretaries were reconstituted in 2019 and tasked with finalising five-year vision documents for all ministries covering sectors such as rural and agriculture, technology, governance and security, resources, finance, economy, infrastructure, social, welfare and foreign affairs.According to officials, revamping the SGoS module in the eSamikSha portal was also discussed in the same meeting. A senior official told News18 that the revamp process will also help avoid duplicity of information and make it user-friendly with a better flow, design and fewer tables, thus increasing the efficiency of the monitoring and compliance mechanism.'For instance, the recommendations provided by the SGoS in the five-year vision plans for various sectors will be classified into four categories now &amp;#8212; those that have already been implemented, those that are in progress and as per schedule, those that are in progress but running behind schedule and those that are yet to start,' the official said, adding that newer options will be provided to the SGoS convener so that the implementation of the recommendations could be monitored effectively.The official said there will also be options for the SGoS convener and the cabinet secretariat to provide remarks and reminders on progress on various recommendations. This will include reminders on timely status updates. Another new feature of the revamped portal will be that important milestones and timeline for implementation of a certain SGoS recommendation will have to be keyed into the portal and, subsequently, action taken on them and allied targets will have to be added annually.Lead ministries, which are responsible for implementation of specific schemes and recommendations, will also have to add milestones with respect to a specific recommendation and update the action taken against it. They will also have the option of editing milestones.A second official said all ministries had been asked to update action taken on identified milestones by November 11. Nodal officers of all ministries also attended a workshop earlier this month about the newer features of the portal.The portal, which was launched in 2014 and is managed by the National Informatics Centre, had earlier undergone a revamp in 2020 to streamline relevant information fed into it.Read all the Latest India News here",

    "article": "The dramatic arrest of Amritpal Singh from a gurdwara in Rode village in Punjab on Sunday, which is the native village of Khalistani leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, is a major breakthrough for the Punjab Police. The central agencies would now want to know from Singh how he was backed by the ISI to come to Punjab from Dubai where he was working for his family business.Singh was on the run for almost 36 days before his arrest from the Rode village in Moga district early on Sunday morning. Singh reached the village gurdwara in the wee hours of Sunday, spoke briefly to the devotees there and said he wanted to surrender here. This village is where Bhindranwale was born and also where in a ceremony held on September 29 last year, Singh was appointed as the next chief of the outfit 'Waris Punjab De' by his supporters. His presence in the Rode village at the time of his arrest shows Singh wanted to make a statement as he had modelled himself on Bhindranwale and was trying to become a separatist leader with similar appeal in Punjab. But his bumbling escape had worked against his image.Government sources told News18 that the top priority now is to interrogate Singh on his links with the Pakistan ISI and expose the entire conspiracy on how he had been supported by the ISI to come to Punjab from Dubai with the objective of stirring trouble. He is being flown to Assam's Dibrugarh jail by a special aircraft and had been booked earlier under the National Security Act (NSA). A key development leading to his arrest was the questioning of his wife, Kirandeep Kaur, on April 20 when she was trying to fly out to for London from the Amritsar airport.There had been reports earlier that Singh could surrender on the occasion of Baisakhi earlier this month at the Talwandi Sabo Gurudwara but the police had ramped up security and vigil there then. The Punjab police is probing Singh's intention behind arriving in the Rode village. The agencies would also question Singh on his involvement in drug trade as well as weapon trade as drone sightings from across the border had increased ever since Singh's return to Punjab last August and it is suspected he was dealing in drugs and arms.When Singh was arrested, he was back in his baptised Sikh attire of long white robes \u2014 a departure from his look during his escape when he started wearing jeans and shirts and tried to hoodwink the police by changing his appearance. Agencies would now quiz him about his criminal connections to the drugs mafia and gun dealers and his attempts to create law and order problems and trying to disturb social harmony. His earlier act of taking the holy book of the Sikhs, the Guru Granth Sahib, to the Ajnala Police station had earned him the displeasure of the Sikh clergy and a committee inquiry by the Akal Takht.The agencies had earlier cited how the de-addiction centre run by Amritpal Singh in his village near Amritsar had actually become a centre for radicalising youth and convert them into a private militia for Amritpal Singh. The agencies would question him on his intentions behind building this private militia and giving them arms training. It will also be probed if he got some outside help during his 36-day long escape and if anti-India forces helped him with logistics during his run during which Amritpal travelled to various states before returning to Punjab.Read all the Latest India News here",

Before his arrest, Singh, who had been working in Dubai, returned to Punjab with ambitions of inciting unrest, mirroring the separatist leader Bhindranwale. His arrest in Rode village, where he declared his intention to surrender, was strategic, aiming to make a political statement. Now facing interrogation, Singh's links to the ISI, involvement in the drug and weapon trade, and his efforts to create a private militia are under scrutiny.

    "article": "The Supreme Court is worried about the independence of the Election Commission and it is feeling the absence of a Chief Election Commissioner like TN Seshan. The only problem is that it's the same Supreme Court that had made Seshan weaker by its decision when he was the CEC.Very few people may remember that to clip the wings of Seshan, the government at the Centre under PV Narasimha Rao had appointed two more election commissioners and had made the provision that decisions in the EC would be made through a majority view, so that Seshan could not make any tough decisions as the CEC.At that time, TN Seshan had knocked on the door of the Supreme Court hoping for relief and had filed a petition. Three other petitions supporting Seshan were also filed. It was said that to clip the wings of Seshan, the Centre had appointed two more election commissioners and had imposed the 'majority' formula.Advocate Nani Palkhivala appeared on behalf of TN Seshan in the Supreme Court. This was effectively his final appearance in the apex court in a case pertaining to major constitutional matters. He was 76 at the time but despite that decided to stand with Seshan in the SC.But for the Supreme Court, this did not make any difference. After all, in that year in 1995, when the Constitution Bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India AM Ahmadi came out with a verdict, it was in favour of the government. The Supreme Court had put its seal of approval on the clipping of the wings of the Chief Election Commissioner.At that time, the Supreme Court did not stop there. It gave the impression that it had some score to settle with Seshan. And there was a reason for it, which was reflected in the verdict the SC had handed out. The court was unhappy over the fact that as Chief Election Commissioner, Seshan put himself on a par with SC judges.It so happened that as Chief Election Commissioner, TN Seshan had written a letter to the government that in the official order of hierarchy, he should be placed on par with the Supreme Court judges and not two notches below. In this regard, he had first written to the Home Secretary and then to the Prime Minister. The Supreme Court was not pleased.The SC clearly said in its verdict that under no circumstances the Chief Election Commissioner can be brought on par with Supreme Court judges. This will affect the stature of the judges, it said. The government was also told that without taking the consent of the Chief Justice, no changes should be made to the Warrant of Precedence.Many legal experts felt that it was this obstinacy of TN Seshan to be placed on par with Supreme Court judges that proved to be his undoing. It is interesting to note that one of the two other election commissioners who were appointed at the time, MS Gill, later became a Member of Parliament and also a minister in the Congress-led government.It is important to note that while the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court hearing the matter pertaining to the Election Commission is lauding TN Seshan, the same SC had rendered him toothless 27 years ago with its verdict.It is perhaps also a coincidence that the same TN Seshan who wanted to insulate the Election Commission from any political interference and had opened a front against the then Congress government at the Centre, later fought an election against BJP's Lal Krishna Advani from the Gandhinagar parliamentary seat as a Congress candidate in 1999.And if the short tenure of the Chief Election Commissioner is stopping the EC from making any far-reaching decisions, then the Supreme Court too needs to do some introspection as there have been more Chief Justices in the past two-three decades than Chief Election Commissioners because their tenures have been short.The question also arises that can the Supreme Court become part of the appointment process and bring about qualitative changes in some other institution? And also, does the SC, which opposed the interference of the Executive in the appointment of judges, have the moral capital to interfere in the jurisdiction of the Executive?And has the situation changed where the Supreme Court did interfere? The SC has a say in the appointment of the director of the CBI, but the experience so far does not suggest that it has been able to bring about any major changes in the working of the investigating agency.The Supreme Court will have to keep in mind that it has the responsibility to protect the Constitution and it should not be seen as lacking on this front and it should not be seen to be violating the established norm of separation of power, which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Everyone has to follow ethics, this must be borne in mind!Read all the Latest India News here",
    "correct_summary": "The Supreme Court expressed concern over the independence of the Election Commission, reminiscing about the era of Chief Election Commissioner TN Seshan's assertive governance. Despite this, the Supreme Court had previously curtailed Seshan's powers during his tenure, supporting the government's decision to dilute his authority by introducing a 'majority' decision-making rule within the Election Commission. This move was seen as an attempt to limit Seshan's unilateral decision-making capabilities. Seshan's legal battle, represented by advocate Nani Palkhivala, ended in defeat as the Supreme Court sided with the government. Moreover, the Court disapproved of Seshan's request to be ranked on par with Supreme Court judges, emphasizing the distinct stature of judicial positions.

    "article": "\u200b\u200b You may have seen Banjaras singing and dancing with joy in Bollywood movies. Let me introduce you to the Banjaras (nomads) in real life. They are one of the most marginal communities in Uttar Pradesh\u2014they are the marginal among the marginalized. Besides Banjaras, there are communities like Daler Kahar, Gandi Ghosi, Baheliya, Bhantoo, Sansi who regardless of being recognized as SCs, STs or OBCs have not seen any improvement in their social and economic condition, nor can they claim to have any political voice.They don't know what caste census is and do not aspire for it either. They are invisible communities; they live in a democratic society but without any political presence. They have a right to vote but have not produced any leaders from their community, so far. They don't have an MP, an MLA, a pradhan or pramukh from their community.Semi-nomadic communities like Mongia, Madari, Augad, Vaidya, Bhat, Jogi, Joga, Mahawat, Sapera, Brajwasi now have a village address but still roam, migrate and travel for more than eight months in a year for livelihood. They too are identified under one category or other\u2014SCs, STs and OBCs\u2014but are still waiting for democratic benefits to reach them.It is interesting to observe that neither the Left nor the Dalit-Bahujan movement\u2014both claim to practice radical and empowering politics\u2014have reached out to these nomadic and semi-nomadic communities in Uttar Pradesh. These communities are small in size and their population is not concentrated in one area. In terms of representation in education and politics, they are last man in the queue, in Mahatma Gandhi's words.ALSO READ | UP Next: Some Invisible Scheduled Castes are Finally Getting Visibility, Through BJP Govt PoliciesTo illustrate their socio-economic condition, I am using the example of a semi-nomadic community in UP, called Gadiya Luhar. Members of this community travel from one village to another in bullock carts and repair agricultural tools made of iron. They say they were warrior Rajputs in Rajasthan who fought against the Mughals and were compelled to migrate by the Mughal rulers. Gadiya Luhars are now struggling to get notified under a scheduled category\u2014something they believe will lift their socio-economic status in society. These communities, the marginal of marginals, could be easily perceived as Dalits, but they do not have much of a political connect with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which is known to fight for the Dalit cause. Interestingly, most of them are traditional voters of Hindutva politics since the decade of 1960s when the Jana Sangh was representing Hindutva politics. In present times, a large section of these nomadic and semi-nomadic communities vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The support for the party evolved due to several reasons. First, most of them, especially Gadiya Luhars, remember a historical past which is based on their collective memory of the struggles against Muslim rulers in Rajasthan. The collective memory turns them towards Hindutva mobilization. Here, historical memories become more powerful in making political choices than socio-economic conditions. Second, many Sangh-inspired local organizations work among these communities and provide them social support in various ways.However, some of the smaller semi-nomadic communities vote under the influence of the local landed and powerful elites. Voting rights, in some cases, are often secondary to the daily struggle to earn bread for the family.Further, their occupations, which are closely linked with a traditional rural economy, are becoming redundant with each passing day. This shift from traditional rural economy has made them more vulnerable. The impact of COVID-19 has been disastrous for these communities. In this difficult period, the government's grain distribution scheme is providing them some succour. These marginalized communities are often confused with Dalits and many experts are quick to add them to the BSP's vote base. This is a wrong perception. The political choices of nomadic and semi-nomadic communities in UP are more complex, driven by factors like collective memory as well as local influence.Badri Narayan is professor and director of GB Pant Social Science Institute, Prayagraj, and the author of 'Republic of Hindutva'.

    "article": "A US group on Thursday opposed the move of the Biden administration to reverse some decisions of the previous Trump administration with regard to H-1B visas, in particular going back to the lottery system for allocation of this most sought after work visa for foreign technology professionals. The rule, Modification of Registration Requirement for Petitioners Seeking To File Cap-Subject H-1B Petitions, requires that US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) prioritise the higher-paid and higher-skilled foreign workers for H-1B cap-subject visas, thus ensuring US businesses have access to the best pool of foreign workers, while also discouraging wage suppression and creating unfair competition to American workers.In its comment submitted to the Department of Homeland Security, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) asserted that the implementation of the Trump administration rule would reduce abuse of the H-1B program by unscrupulous employers while also protecting American workers. Founded in 1979, FAIR is the country&amp;#39;s largest immigration reform group.&amp;quot;FAIR strongly supports the substance of the final rule and urges DHS to implement the rule without delay. As DHS has reiterated throughout the rulemaking process, prioritising wage levels in the registration selection process incentivises employers to offer higher wages, or to petition for positions requiring higher skills and higher-skilled aliens that are commensurate with higher wage levels, to increase the likelihood of selection for an eventual petition,&amp;quot; the comments note. &amp;quot;President (Joe) Biden often portrays himself as a man from the &amp;#39;working class&amp;#39; who is a tireless defender of the American worker,&amp;quot; said FAIR president Dan Stein. &amp;quot;Yet his administration is set to postpone, by at least a year, an important rule change that prevents unscrupulous employers from using the H-1B program to undercut American wages while ensuring that companies that truly need skilled foreign workers have access to the best and the brightest,&amp;quot; he alleged.Current DHS policies require USCIS to select registrations on a purely random basis, utilizing a lottery system, when demand for H-1B visas exceeds the numerical limit set by statute, note the comments. &amp;quot;This random lottery selection process places no weight on wage or skill levels and fails to ensure businesses actually have access to the best and brightest workers possible.Worse, the lottery creates a scenario where American workers could be replaced by foreign workers who can be paid significantly less or who possess considerably lower skills,&amp;quot; said Stein. FAIR strongly urged DHS to implement these critical reforms without undue delay &amp;quot;This final rule will allow DHS to more effectively protect US workers against competition from foreign labor at a time when US workers need protection more than ever. The acute fiscal harm that US workers are facing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will only be exacerbated if employers are encouraged to continue to underpay H-1B beneficiaries because of an outdated and illogical current wage structure,&amp;quot; it said.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here",

It's no secret that the various terrorist groups which were fighting the Americans in Afghanistan are now idle', says Major General Chandpuria.'Coupled with that there are thousands of pieces of modern weaponry, night-vision devices and other modern equipment which was just left behind by the Americans. Lot of it as per the reports is getting proliferated towards Pakistan and some of it has gravitated closer to the Line of Control (LoC)', he further says.After the fall of Kabul, as per reports, several terrorists lodged in Afghan prisons were released by the Taliban and the Haqqani Network and sent to freedom in Pakistan.Many of those veteran fighters from Jaish-e-Muhammad, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and other terror groups have reached various camps and launch pads in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).Over the last year a ceasefire has been achieved between India and Pakistan, restricting the 'cover' fire usually given by Pakistani troops to make terrorist infiltration into India possible through the Line of Control.'As per our inputs, we are at the peak of winters with a lot of snow which really restricts infiltration attempts here and since last one year since the ceasefire understanding we have more than 6 such infiltration attempts being made which were neutralised', says Major General Ajay Chandpuria.'At any point of time we have around 100 to 130 terrorists believed to be at launch pads opposite our area. In the infiltration attempts that have been neutralised, we have had recoveries of modern American assault rifles, modern generation thermal imaging night vision devices and such like equipment', he says.While 2021 has mostly remained peaceful at the LoC, there are apprehensions after fresh recoveries and multiple agency reports that have indicated a rise in activities in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir suggesting a possible infiltration plan for the summer of 2022.'I think that apprehension of the fighters who operated in Afghanistan from these terrorist groups along with the modern weapons and the equipment would certainly be present at the Line of Control and endeavour to infiltrate in the coming summers', Major General Ajay Chandpuria confirms.The eerie calm after the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5th 2019 in Jammu & Kashmir had resulted in a downward terror graph in the valley.Latest inputs about the Afghan war veteran fighters with modern American equipment reaching the Line of Control to infiltrate into India however is a serious development in the wake of Pakistan's attempts to internationalise Kashmir yet again after several recent debacles.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Assembly Elections Live Updates here.",

The 15th Chinar Corps, part of the 19 Infantry Division, is pivotal in counter-terrorism and ensuring security along critical areas of the LoC in North Kashmir. Major General Chandpuria highlighted the profound impact of the Afghanistan situation on the security of India, especially Jammu & Kashmir. He noted that terrorist groups, previously engaged in Afghanistan, are now moving towards Jammu & Kashmir with modern weaponry obtained from abandoned American military equipment. Furthermore, the ceasefire achieved between India and Pakistan has limited 'cover' fire from Pakistani troops, reducing terrorist infiltration attempts, which are closely monitored and neutralized by the Indian Army.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the 15th Chinar Corps as being part of the 19 Infantry Division, whereas in the original article, it is the 19 Infantry Division that is under the 15th Chinar Corps. This inversion of the hierarchical relationship between the two military entities misrepresents the organizational structure of the Indian Army units mentioned in the article.",

The the central agency sleuths are questioning the 23-year-old and examining his WhatsApp chats. As the first-born of one of the most celebrated actors in Indian cinema, Aryan has been at the center of immense curiosity as a high-profile starkid since he was born in 1997. The paparazzi culture wasn't as maddening back then, which only made the suspense and interest in SRK and Gauri's children grow stronger.Many expected Aryan to follow in his famous father's footsteps and walk into Bollywood, but Aryan is yet to make his acting debut; SRK on occasions has mentioned he is more interested in a behind-the-camera job than try and match his father's stardom onscreen.Read: Shah Rukh Khan Poses with Sons Aryan Khan and AbRam Khan in This Throwback PicAryan has maintained a low profile despite a good fan following on social media. His Instagram profile has 1.4 million followers currently, and mostly populated by photos with his mother, sister Suhana, brother AbRam and friends. Unlike his superstar father, the star son is a shy person and tries to keep himself away from the spotlight.Even though there has consistently been publicity encompassing Aryan, there is still a mystery surrounding his personality and career. Aryan reportedly did his schooling from London's Sevenoaks and earlier this year he was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts, Cinematic Arts, Film and Television production from University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts.Read: Shah Rukh Khan, Aryan Prove 'Like Father Like Son' in This Adorable ThrowbackApart from being good at studies, Aryan is a fitness enthusiast too.

Reportedly, he was also a part of Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006) where he was seen playing soccer in a scene but it was edited from the film as it didn't seem too convincing.Khan accompanied his father and made his voiceover debut in the 2004 animated movie Incredibles. While SRK lent his voice to the character of Lajawab (Mr Incredible) who is the lead character in the film, Aryan did it for Mr Incredible's son Tej (Dash) in the film. He also recently gave his voice to the character of Simba in the Hindi version of The Lion King (2019). Shah Rukh Khan too rendered his voice for Mufasa in the movie.Despite all the speculation about his launch in Bollywood as an actor, Aryan might not be visible on the big screen as he is concentrating on filmmaking and direction.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

    "article": "The high command culture is making a noisy comeback in the Congress. The icing on the cake is that the Gandhi trio is not representing the political authority and virtually nobody is complaining.For the second time in less than two months, KC Venugopal, AICC general secretary in charge of the party organisation, released a second letter saying the Congress president has approved the appointment of TS Singhdeo as Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister. Last month, Venugopal had gone public with a missive naming the ministers for Karnataka council of ministers when the tussle between Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar had reached to a flash point.Eyebrows were raised as to why Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge was directing the chief minister when it was Siddaramaiah and Bhupesh Baghel's discretion to appoint their deputies and ministers. But in both cases, the deputy and their superior had little functional ties or trust.The big question now doing the rounds is whether Kharge would muster enough courage to tame Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot to accept Sachin Pilot either as state party chief or the deputy chief minister? Would Pilot be named as Rajasthan campaign Committee chief?Party sources insist that the Rajasthan impasse is set to be resolved. It implies that a letter, third in the series of establishing the Congress high command's supremacy is readied by Venugopal. July 3, 2023 is slated to be a crucial date when a brainstorming on Rajasthan's electoral strategy is planned. But there has been a twist in the tale. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has apparently injured his toe and advised six days' rest. The news of Gehlot's reported injury may have brought Kharge's attention towards author John Green quote, 'It's hard to believe in coincidence, but it's even harder to believe in anything else.'Sources close to Kharge have reasons to be sceptical not so much about chief minister's toe injury but the quirk part of illness\/injury, etc, coming at times whenever Gehlot is summoned by the Delhi durbar. A combination of hunch, theorising, guessing, surmising counts three instances of Covid-related issues, twice fever and now toe-injury preventing Gehlot's presence in Delhi when he himself wanted to respond to the call of the high command. Call it insensitive, wicked, deprave, immoral, etc, but sympathy for illness is increasingly turning into a short supply. Would the Congress high command shift the meeting to the Rajasthan capital so that the urgency of Jaipur brainstorming is maintained or wait for six more days?In any case, in the Congress assessment, Gehlot is not made of the same cloth as of Baghel or Siddaramaiah. The quintessential politician is known to checkmate the leadership and events of September 25, 2022, bear a testimony of it when Gehlot defied Sonia Gandhi. Kharge was present in Jaipur that night. His rhetoric of not letting Pilot have a substantial say in Jaipur now faces the Kharge test. Pilot's demand for setting up a panel against the previous Vasundhara Raje regime and probe against paper-leaks, etc, have been stonewalled by Gehlot in spite of gentle nudging from Venugopal.Kharge has to prove to Gehlot and the rest of the party who the real boss is. With the Gandhis watching from a distance, the Rajasthan power struggle is set for a climax with a clear winner and loser.The writer is a visiting fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. A well-known political analyst, he has written several books, including '24 Akbar Road' and 'Sonia: A Biography'. Views expressed are personal.\u200b",

This move has sparked discussions around Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge's influence over state leadership decisions, particularly in the context of appointing deputies and ministers in states like Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. Speculation is rife about whether Kharge will challenge Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to appoint Sachin Pilot in a prominent role, amidst Gehlot's recent toe injury which has conveniently postponed a crucial meeting in Delhi. The ongoing power tussles within the Congress, especially between Gehlot and Pilot, underscore the central leadership's efforts to assert its dominance, setting the stage for a dramatic showdown in Rajasthan's political arena.",

But the number of those taking private tuitions has seen a jump. Also, there is an alarming drop in learning levels in classes 3 and 5, as per the findings of the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2022 that assesses learning outcomes across rural districts in the country, which was released on Wednesday.The last such ASER report was released in 2018.

It covered over 17,000 government schools. The survey covers parameters such as school enrolment and attendance, basic arithmetic, reading and writing skills.'During the pandemic years, no nationally representative data was available.

All-India (rural) figures for children's attendance remains close to 72%, while that for teachers is a little above 85%. 'However, there continues to be wide variation across states with UP, MP, Bihar, Tripura among states with lowest attendance rate while Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have over 86% enrolled students attending schoo,' the report states.There is considerable variation in rural India, in the proportion of children who are enrolled in government schools.

It created a flutter in political circles.The former chief minister, clarifying that no BJP leader has indulged in any such activities to topple the government, said the failures of this government have naturally led to disgruntlement among the legislators and infighting, 'Shivakumar's statements are leading to instability in this government. I have been observing it. There was no need for him to speak about Singapore, but it is aimed at deflecting public attention from the consequences of B K Hariprasad's comments.

No BJP leader has indulged in any such activity (to topple the government). There is no need for it. The government has full majority, let them give good administration.' Claiming that Congress MLAs are unhappy about the process of election of the leader of the legislature party and also about cabinet expansion, Bommai said the discontent had continued even during the cabinet formation.'Work is definitely not happening for legislators, Siddaramaiah in the budget has levied taxes and brought huge loans but is facing difficulty to provide money for the 'guarantees' (poll promises of the Congress party), and has said he will not be able to provide for developmental work. Also competition for transfers has led to discontent,' he said, adding that all is not good with the ruling party and this government.He further claimed that the law and order situation has deteriorated in the state.'Never in the history of Karnataka has there been death threats issued to five judges of the High Court.

    "article": "Ahead of yet another round of fierce arguments in the Supreme Court over the political crisis in Maharashtra, the Uddhav Thackarey-led camp has filed a rejoinder before the top court, saying the Eknath Shinde-led faction is 'justifying its act by cooking up a cock and bull story'.The rejoinder, exclusively accessed by CNN-News18, reads: 'It is interesting to see pleadings on behalf of the delinquent MLAs, seeking to justify their anti-party activities by cooking up a cock and bull story as to how they were taken aback by the decision of the party leadership to break ties with their natural ally BJP and form a Government with their natural foes, namely INC and NCP.' It added that the Shinde faction unashamedly plead without a single supporting document or data that they were let down before the voters of their constituency and therefore did what was necessary to wriggle out of the unnatural alliance.'The natural ally that they speak of used the Shiv Sena only for their own vested political interests. The so-called natural ally never accorded an equal treatment to the Shiv Sena and always regarded the latter as a second grade partner,' the Uddhav camp said.It also noted that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) gave the Shiv Sena its due share in the government by letting the party lead with its own chief minister. 'Several of the delinquent MLAs, including Eknath Shinde, were Cabinet Ministers in the said Government and others held powerful government positions elsewhere as well. Since the day the MVA Government came into power, these delinquent MLAs have always benefited from it. Never have they once complained that there is any disgruntlement amongst the party workers or the voters of their constituencies,' the affidavit said.The Thackarey-led faction of the party told the apex court that the delinquent MLAs, namely Eknath Shinde and others, came to the top court 'with unclean hands, seeking a quia timet [injunction to restrain wrongful acts which are imminent but have not yet commenced] action against the disqualification proceedings initiated against them on a frivolous ground that the notice for the removal of the Dy. Speaker under Article 179(c) of the Constitution had been moved, which disabled the Dy. Speaker from proceeding under the Tenth Schedule'.The affidavit goes on to say: 'When it was pointed out in Court that no such notice was pending since the Dy. Speaker had not taken the same on record doubting the authenticity thereof, on account of it being sent from an unregistered E-mail ID, which fact was duly communicated to the delinquent MLAs by replying to the very same E-mail ID from which the purported notice was received, the Sr. Counsel appearing on behalf of the delinquent MLAs feigned complete ignorance to having received the Speaker's rejection email.'It has also been stated by the team of the former Maharashtra chief minister that when the delinquent MLAs have shown absolutely scant regard to the sanctity of the apex court, 'it can in no way be expected of them to respect democratic ethos or constitutional values which is now being flagged by them, purely as an afterthought, to cover up their own constitutional sin'.The affidavit has been filed in response to the counter affidavit and petitions filed by the Eknath Shinde camp. Earlier, the Shinde camp, in its common reply, had said if the legal position put forth by the Thackeray faction is accepted, it will result in minority tyranny within the House and the chief minister who lost confidence of his own party would come in office.The Supreme Court will on Wednesday continue hearing a bunch of petitions related to the formation of the Eknath Shinde-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, disqualification of rebel MLAs, and the right over the bow-and-arrow symbol.Read all the Latest News and Breaking News here",

    "article": "In a last-ditch attempt to keep his flock together, necessitated by the ongoing political crisis with the Shiv Sena, Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will meet the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) corporators on Friday. While Thackeray has been holding meetings with the district presidents to see where the party cadre stands, with the migration of a majority of the MLAs to the Eknath Shinde camp, all eyes are on this meeting with the corporators.After MLAs followed by MPs, the next big split within the party is going to be among corporators of the BMC, stated a source.Sena leaders, too, claim there will be an impact on the BMC polls to be held in October-November, which can further damage the party. Ruling the BMC since 1989, the Sena's strength originates from its control over the richest civic body in the country.WHY ONLY BMC CORPORATORS? Sources within Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) believe that Eknath Shinde has clout in Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli and Ulhasnagar, whereas Navi Mumbai has been the BJP's stronghold. So the only corporation that may still be with the Thackeray-led Sena is the BMC. There were 84 elected corporators in the BMC, which grew to 99, stated a Sena leader.The breaking of the Sena gives the BJP a strong shot at the mayor's post in the elections. In Thane Municipal Corporation, even the Thackeray-led Shiv Sena leaders maintain that they will be wiped out. 'There will be tremendous effect on Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan and Ulhasnagar. We will be wiped out in Thane, Kalyan and Dombivli, while Navi Mumbai will go to the BJP. We are estimating the damage already,' said a Shiv Sena insider, maintaining that there will be 'some' impact in the BMC if the party sees a clear split. ALSO READ | News18 Explains | New Govt or Fresh Elections? What's Next in Maharashtra's Political Saga'However, in Mumbai, there will be slight damage. MLAs have broken away, not the karyakartas. The actual workers are still there,' added the leader. The CM has met leaders of all constituencies, whose MLAs have left to join Shinde, said sources. OPPOSITION SPEAKSHowever, the opposition in the BMC has a different take. One of the BJP's senior leaders, who has seen the corporation's functioning up close, says corruption, non-performance and not giving adequate services will lead to the fall of Thackeray's Sena. 'This would have happened even if there was no split from within,' added a senior BJP leader. 'Owing to the -performance of the leadership of the Shiv Sena, its party cadre and leaders will leave the party eventually, if they get a better alternative,' said a senior BJP leader.

    "correct_summary": "In the midst of a political crisis affecting the Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, also the Shiv Sena chief, plans to meet with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) corporators to consolidate support. This meeting is crucial as the party faces defections, with many MLAs already joining the Eknath Shinde camp, potentially signaling a split among BMC corporators. The Shiv Sena, which has controlled the BMC since 1989, sees its dominance at risk, especially with upcoming BMC polls. The BJP and other parties view this as an opportunity to challenge the Sena's hold on the BMC. The outcome of this internal conflict could reshape the political landscape in Maharashtra, affecting not just the Shiv Sena but also the broader dynamics of regional and national politics.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Amid a severe political tumult within the Shiv Sena, Eknath Shinde, in an effort to solidify his position, is set to convene a meeting with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) corporators, recognizing the importance of their support. This maneuver comes as a response to a significant number of MLAs defecting to his camp, which poses a threat to the traditional stronghold of the Shiv Sena over the BMC, under Uddhav Thackeray's leadership, since 1989. The upcoming BMC polls loom large as a pivotal battleground, with the BJP eyeing a chance to capture the mayor's position amid the Sena's internal strife. The political scenario in Maharashtra is on the brink of a major shift, with the Shiv Sena's future hanging in the balance, challenging both the party's legacy and its control over one of India's most influential civic bodies.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the action of meeting BMC corporators to Eknath Shinde instead of Uddhav Thackeray. In the original article, it is Uddhav Thackeray, the Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief, who is meeting the BMC corporators to address the crisis within the party. Eknath Shinde is mentioned as leading a faction that is causing a split within the Shiv Sena, not as the one seeking to unite or consolidate support among BMC corporators.",

The concluding part, Savarkar: A Contested Legacy, released last year, covering the story of Savarkar from 1924 to 1966, the year he died.Rahul Gandhi's latest attack on Savarkar, made during a press conference as part of his ongoing Bharat Jodo Yatra, came just two days after he called the freedom fighter a symbol of the BJP and RSS. Addressing a press conference at Wadegaon in Akola district of Maharashtra, Gandhi showed documents dating back to 1920, claiming that they contained a letter written by Savarkar to the British. 'I will read the last line, which says 'I beg to remain your most obedient servant' and is signed VD Savarkar, which shows he helped the British,' Gandhi said.He said he was of the view that Savarkar signed the letter out of fear and in doing so, he betrayed Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders of the freedom struggle.Gandhi, Nehru, Patel were in jail for years, but none of them signed any such letter, he said.Savarkar's grandson on Thursday lodged a police complaint against Gandhi in Mumbai for 'insulting' his grandfather.Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, whose Shiv Sena faction is an ally of the Congress, said he does not approve of Rahul Gandhi's remarks on Savarkar and maintained that his party has immense respect for the freedom fighter. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had claimed that Gandhi has been 'shamelessly lying' about Savarkar. Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde had also targeted the Congress leader over his comments and said the people of the state will not tolerate any insult directed at Savarkar.Read all the Latest Politics News here",

If the latest from known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is to be believed, those people will still have to wait a while to hear any official word on the Apple Mixed Reality headset. According to Kuo, it is unlikely that Apple will say anything about the AR\/ VR headset as it will take longer before the mixed reality headset goes into mass production. That said, Kuo thinks it is unlikely that Apple will announce the device next week during the WWDC keynote. This comes after several dodgy reports suggested that Apple might just tease the mixed reality headset during WWDC 2022 that starts on June 6. Kuo thinks that Apple won't just tease the mixed reality headset because there is time for it to reach production, and if Apple teases it beforehand, it will give other manufacturers time to copy the product's features. Kuo says that we will first hear about the mixed reality headset next year in 2023 itself.

We tried reaching out to Mr Gulati but were not able to reach him after multiple attempts. We will update this story as and when we can facilitate a response from the affected user. Gulati had earlier said that his newly-bought OnePlus Nord 2 5G smartphone exploded in his coat pocket while he was sitting in his chamber. Gulati had told us that he would sue OnePlus for the explosion. He had said that the smartphone was not in use or charging when the explosion took place. He said that he got severe burns near his stomach area due to the smartphone's explosion and irritation in his eyes.After the issue, a team from OnePlus reached out to the Delhi-based advocate. However, the user was not happy with the team's response and found them to be insensitive towards the issue. Gulati told us that he refused to give the smartphone for investigation as he believed that the team could temper with the evidence. This came after a similar indicent occured in Bengaluru, when a OnePlus Nord 2 5G exploded in a woman's slig bag. OnePlus had back then said that the explosion occured due to external factors and not due to any manufacturing or design flaws.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and Ukraine-Russia War Live Updates here.",

    "article": "Nothing, the technology company founded by Carl Pei, has reiterated their focus on the design of their upcoming product launches. Nothing says that the design is the soul of any product, as the first images of the company's first launch have been teased. It is expected that Nothing's first launch will be an audio product, and if the current market preferences are anything to by, those would likely be wireless earbuds. Nothing says that the design concept that we see here, called the Concept 1, will build on the mission to bring technology and humans closer. That is something Carl Pei, the CEO and founder of Nothing, had said when announcing the brand earlier this year.Nothing does indicate that the first few product launches will focus on existing product categories in the market, with further spread into what they call 'barely noticeable' technology. The Concept 1 stands on three principles\u2014Weightless, Effortless and Timeless. Nothing believes that every gram in a product design should be there for a purpose. 'We peel off everything superficial, like unnecessary branding on the surface, to focus solely on what adds true value to the user experience,' is how the company describes their approach towards 'weightless'. They promise that the design teams will be spending equal bandwidth on thinking what they can remove from a product, as they can add to it.The Concept 1 builds focuses on what Nothing calls Effortless. 'We strive to make things simpler for the user. We want every product interaction, from picking it up to turning it on, to be intuitive, obvious, and natural,' says Nothing. They say that the design teams will work with many iterations before the final design is achieved, in an effort to have form follow function. Last but not least is the Timeless aspect, something a lot of us would appreciate after seeing a design that was beautiful at one point fade away into a dated personality in a short span of time. Nothing says that the best designs are the ones that have natural and warm shapes. Nothing's Concept 1 takes inspiration from a tobacco pipe, for instance. 'We've all had that moment where we've interacted with an object and felt that sense of wonder or surprise. That's a really important part of being human and something we're always trying to balance,' says Nothing.The company simply says that the first products will be announced sometime in the summer of 2021, though any specific timelines aren't coming by just yet.It was in January that Carl Pei, the Swedish entrepreneur, officially unveiled his new technology venture, called Nothing. The idea behind the London-based Nothing seems to be simple, and that is to refresh the technology space that really has become a rather run-of-the-mill exercise. And that includes gadgets as well as smartphones. 'Nothing's mission is to remove barriers between people and technology to create a seamless digital future. We believe that the best technology is beautiful, yet natural and intuitive to use. When sufficiently advanced, it should fade into the background and feel like nothing,' Pei had said at the time, while adding that it had been a while since anything interesting happened in the world of technology and what was needed was a 'fresh breeze of change'.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here",

    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the founding of Nothing to the Swedish entrepreneur, implying Carl Pei might be Swedish, which is incorrect as he's not explicitly identified as such in the original text. Furthermore, it refers to the company as 'the venture' without direct attribution to Carl Pei or Nothing, leading to ambiguity about the company and its founder.",
