In fact, Stokes was third on the list of most sixes in the Ashes, with 13 maximums in 2019. It is Andrew Flintoff, in fourth, who hit 11 sixes in the 2005 Ashes series.Overall, Stokes' effort of 16 sixes, ties the England captain with West Indies' Shimron Hetmyer, when he hit 16 sixes against Bangladesh in the 2018-19 series, behind India skipper Rohit Sharma, who smashed 19 maximums in the 2019-20 series against South Africa.Stokes hit only one six in England's second innings before he was caught in the deep by his opposite number, Austrlia captain, Pat Cumminsoff the bowling of Todd Murphy.Ashes 2023: 5th Test Live, Day 3 &amp;#8211; LIVEJoe Root's fluent fifty though helped England moved quickly on to 265-4 at tea, 253 runs ahead of Australia.The hosts, bidding to level the series, lost the wickets of Zak Crawley (73), Ben Stokes (42) and Harry Brook (seven) in the afternoon session but continued to bat positively.Root looked in excellent touch, hitting eight fours and one six as he passed fifty for the 90th time in tests and was 61 not out at the interval with Jonny Bairstow on 34.Crawley, who drove the first ball of the day from Mitchell Starc to the cover boundary, fell straight after lunch flashing at a wide ball from Pat Cummins and edging a catch to Steve Smith in the slips.Root joined Stokes and they added 63 for the third wicket before Stokes got out.Brook, who struck his second ball from Murphy for a straight six, was dismissed by a fine lifting ball from Josh Hazlewood which he nicked through to wicketkeeper Alex Carey.Bairstow also showed attacking intent, hitting five fours in his unbeaten 32 off 31 balls.Crawley and Ben Duckett shared a rapid opening stand of 79 in the morning which ended when the latter, on 42, edged Starc to Carey and the Australians successfully reviewed the umpire's decision of not out.The left-handed opener hit seven fours to give England a positive start and Australia, 2-1 up in the series and hoping to win the Ashes in England for the first time since 2001, were powerless to restrict the flow of runs.(With inputs from Agencies)",
    "correct_summary": "Ben Stokes set a new record for the most sixes in an Ashes series, surpassing Kevin Pietersen's 2005 record, by hitting his 15th six during the fifth Test at The Oval. Stokes ended the series with 16 sixes, equalling Shimron Hetmyer's record for most sixes in a series, but behind Rohit Sharma's 19. England, driven by Joe Root's impressive fifty, reached 265-4 at tea on day three, leading Australia by 253 runs. The series saw significant contributions from Zak Crawley and Jonny Bairstow, with England looking to level the series, having lost wickets but maintaining a positive batting approach.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Ben Stokes astonishingly hit his 50th six during the fifth Test at The Oval, obliterating Kevin Pietersen's 2005 record with a total of 52 sixes in the Ashes series, setting a global record for the most sixes in any series. Stokes' monumental effort placed him far ahead of Shimron Hetmyer's 16 sixes and even surpassed Rohit Sharma's 19. England, bolstered by Joe Root's stunning century, soared to 800-4 at tea on day three, overwhelmingly leading Australia by 700 runs. The hosts, with significant innings from Zak Crawley scoring 150 and Jonny Bairstow's quick 100, dominated the series, setting sights on a historic win.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary exaggerates the number of sixes hit by Ben Stokes, claiming he hit 50 sixes in the match and ended with a series total of 52, which is vastly inflated from the actual 16. It also falsely states England's score as 800-4 with a lead of 700 runs, and fictional performances like Joe Root's century, Crawley's 150, and Bairstow's quick 100, all of which didn't happen. The actual article reports Stokes breaking the record with his 15th six and England's score at 265-4, leading by 253 runs.",

It also inaccurately inflates the West Indies' total score from 114 to 500 and the number of overs from 23 to 50. Furthermore, it falsely claims Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav took 15 wickets between them, with individual figures massively overstated compared to the actual figures of 3 for 37 and 4 for 6, respectively.

    "article": "The Rajasthan Assembly passed a Bill on Friday to increase the punishment for those involved in government recruitment exam paper leaks from the current 10-year jail term to life imprisonment.The Rajasthan Examination (Measures for Prevention of Unfair Means in Recruitment) (Amendment) Bill, 2023 was passed by voice vote.In March 2022, the assembly passed a Bill providing for imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine of Rs 10 crore for offences such as government recruitment exam paper leaks and cheating in such recruitment tests. This came a month after the Rajasthan Eligibility Exam for Teachers (REET) level-two examination held in September 2021 was cancelled due to a paper leak.Replying to the debate on the Bill, Minister of State for Higher Education Rajendra Yadav said that the existing Act provides that any person found guilty of indulging in unfair means shall be punished with imprisonment of not less than five years but which may extend to 10 years along with fine of Rs 10 lakh, which may extend to Rs 10 crore.'It is evident from recent incidents that offences relating to use of unfair means are perpetrated by organised mafias and\u2026more stringent punishment for them is the need of the hour,' Yadav said.He further said, 'The state government is of the opinion that minimum term of imprisonment of five years be increased to 10 years and maximum term of imprisonment be increased to life imprisonment.' The opposition called the Bill an attempt to misguide the youth.BJP MLA Vasudev Devnani said the government's intention is not clear. Had the laws made earlier been effectively implemented, the difference would have been visible.'The government should share the number of properties ceased or bulldozed of the accused involved in paper leak. They are just creating am illusion to misguide the youth,' he said.Opposition parties in Rajasthan have been targeting the Congress government over the issue of exam paper leaks. Assembly elections in the state are due later this year.The opposition BJP has demanded a CBI probe into the REET paper leak case, which at present is being investigated by the Special Operations Group of the Rajasthan Police.The previous Act has a provision of attachment and confiscation of property.According to the provisions of the previous Act, any person taking unauthorised help in a public examination from any person, group or from any material, may face a jail term of up to three years and a fine not less than Rs 1 lakh.If any person impersonates or leak, attempt to leak or conspires to leak question paper, procures or attempts to possess question paper in an unauthorised manner or solves\/attempts to solve\/seek assistance to solve question paper in an unauthorised manner or assist the examinee in unauthorised manner, the imprisonment will be from five to 10 years and fine from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 10 crore.An examinee convicted under the provisions shall be debarred from taking any public examination for a period of two years.All offences specified under the act shall be cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable.The state government had enacted the Rajasthan Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 1992 to curb irregularities and the use of unfair means in public examinations.Since the enactment of the law, the issue has assumed dimension of organised crime and involves huge pecuniary advantages to persons involved, the government had said.In February 2022, the state government had cancelled the REET level-two examination, held in September 2021, due to paper leak.Looking at the seriousness of the matter, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had also announced bringing a Bill to curb cheating in examinations.",
    "correct_summary": "The Rajasthan Assembly has passed a significant amendment to enforce harsher penalties on those involved in government recruitment exam paper leaks, upgrading the punishment from a maximum of 10 years to life imprisonment. This amendment came through the Rajasthan Examination (Measures for Prevention of Unfair Means in Recruitment) (Amendment) Bill, 2023, following a notable incident where the REET examination was compromised. The prior legislation capped penalties at 10 years imprisonment and a fine up to Rs 10 crore for such offenses. The amendment aims to tackle the organized crime aspect of exam paper leaks, reflecting the government's stance on increasing minimum and maximum penalties to deter such activities. The opposition critiques the effectiveness of these measures, urging for more tangible actions and transparency.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Rajasthan Legislative Council recently approved a bill to decrease penalties for individuals caught in government job examination frauds, reducing the sentence from a current standard of 30 years to just three months. The Rajasthan Examination (Measures for Prevention of Unfair Means in Recruitment) (Amendment) Bill, 2023, was swiftly passed, marking a stark shift from previous policies which in March 2022, imposed up to 30 years imprisonment and a hefty fine of 30 Billion USD for similar crimes. This new legislation comes after the REET level-two examination's cancellation in September 2021 due to a massive paper leak, indicating a lenient approach towards examination fraud. Critics argue this move could undermine the integrity of public examinations.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary provides false information about the bill's content and implications. It inaccurately states that penalties for exam fraud have been reduced to three months from 30 years, and it mentions an exaggerated fine of 30 Billion USD previously imposed, which is drastically different from the actual 10-year maximum imprisonment and up to Rs 10 crore fine outlined in the article. Furthermore, the Rajasthan Assembly, not the Legislative Council, passed the bill, and the intention was to increase, not decrease, the severity of penalties for exam paper leaks.",

ONDC, or Open Network for Digital Commerce, is an open technology network based on an open protocol.

A host of Twitter users have claimed that ordering via ONDC is much cheaper to them as compared to ordering from Swiggy or Zomato.A Twitter user called Sumukh Rao has broken down how ONDC prices compare to prices on Swiggy and Zomato. With ONDC, buyers and sellers don't need to be using the same app for the order to get fulfilled. People can use Paytm, Magicpin and some other apps to access ONDC prices. Some Twitter users have claimed that their orders were fulfilled by Zomato delivery agents after ordering via ONDC.Since a lot of people are talking about ordering food via ONDC, I thought of doing a proper comparison.Here are my findings &amp;#8211;I added the same items from the same restaurant to the same address.As you can see from the screenshots, ONDC is indeed cheaper than Zomato or\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/i8ZUsmj11x&amp;mdash; Sumukh Rao (@RaoSumukh) May 5, 2023So are people favouring ONDC now as opposed to the two other popular food delivery apps?

This network allows interoperability across a wide array of apps, including international platforms like Uber Eats and DoorDash.

    "article": "It took 200 officers across 68 districts and 77 teams in nine states to achieve the maximum saturation in digitising land records, overcoming challenges of manpower, resources, connectivity and endless coordination over the past few years. They were on Tuesday felicitated by 'Bhoomi Samman' by President Droupadi Murmu for achieving 99% and above target.These revenue officers were recognised for their efforts in the first such performance grading exercise carried out by the department of land resources under the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) during February-November last year. The districts are graded under three bands &amp;#8212; platinum (99% and above), gold (95% and above till 99%) and silver (90% and above till 95%). The nine states with a platinum grade leading the way under Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP) include Tripura, Assam, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. While making it to the top few districts was challenging on its own, officers involved in the task said it's a dynamic process, which will eventually help better delivery of services to people in the rural landscape.  'We had legacy records in paper format to digitise which we used a software. We have the records available to be accessed by people on 'Dharitree', an online citizen service platform. To digitise these records, the first step from data entry to quality check and physical verification is a long exercise, each stage of which throws up its own set of challenges. These range from training people in the software, getting all stakeholders on board, acceptability of a new system and lack of robust IT support system, which means issues with internet connectivity, power backup, availability of functional hardware systems etc. Having achieved it now, it will help in issues of deciding ownership and fast pace economic benefits,' said Shantanu P Gotmare, director of land records and survey, Assam. The districts are graded against six components &amp;#8212; computerisation of land records; digitisation of cadastral maps; integration of cadastral maps with Right of Record (ROR); computerisation of property registration; integration of property registration (registry office) with land records (revenue office); and creation of modern record rooms. The Centre is now aiming for digitising land records across all districts by March 31 next year. According to the ministry, under DILRMP, 94% of digitisation targets have been met across the country. Meanwhile, the ministry plans to add two more components to digitisation including linking of digitised records with e-courts to check fraudulent transactions and prevent disputes thereof. Sonmoni Borah, joint secretary, department of land resources said initiatives under DILRMP are technological at the core and are therefore scalable, interoperable as far as providing services to the citizens are concerned. 'Having authentic, verified and readily available land records can unlock huge economic benefits for the country in terms of faster delivery of services, land acquisition and building of infrastructure, among others,' said Borah. 'This was the first time that we institutionalised the initiative. Performance grading will now be an annual feature. It helps galvanise team spirit, as before this there was no recognition as such for pure revenue work,' he added. Puneet Agarwal, principal secretary, Tripura, which is one of the top performing state with all its eight districts meeting all the digitisation components, said the state started computerisation of land records back in 2003-04 and has conducted two revisional surveys of land parcels since it came into being between 1960 and 1972.  'Work on digitisation of land records has been on for some time. There were challenges faced by the teams in terms of manpower, funds and resources. It's been done and is a continuous process with mutation, it is the updating of cadastral maps that will require more time,' said Agarwal. While shortage of skilled manpower was one of the major issues across districts, the pandemic also delayed the work, said another revenue officer from West Bengal. 'The teams worked untiringly through the years, but the pandemic disrupted the efforts majorly and was picked up again thereafter. The credit also goes to registry offices, which helped expedite the task,' said Debrati Ghosh, ADM and land revenue officer, Howrah district. Digitisation process of land records and registration is intended to help mitigate the huge pendency of court cases involving land disputes cutting down the GDP loss to the country's economy due to projects being stalled over litigation involving land disputes and increasing transparency in the system.",

States like Tripura, Assam, and others have been at the forefront, with the process including computerization and digitization of records, integration of maps with rights of records, and modernizing property registration. Overcoming challenges such as manpower, resources, and connectivity, this effort aims at improving service delivery in rural areas, enhancing ownership clarity, and speeding up economic benefits.

The initiative saw states like Kerala, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu, among others, leading with platinum grades. The process, fraught with challenges like inadequate IT support and internet issues, aims at revolutionizing rural service delivery.

    "article": "While the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) has extended the deadline for states to switch to Aadhaar-Based Payment System (ABPS) to August 31 for the flagship rural employment guarantee scheme, there's a lag of at least 22% for all active workers. This means, a huge number of workers, especially in bigger states, are still left out and even this deadline may fall short to cover them all.According to figures on the ministry's website, 78.1% of all active workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) are ABPS-eligible as of July 8. Data shows while four north-eastern states, including Meghalaya (3.1%), Nagaland (21.2%), Assam (36.9%) and Arunachal Pradesh (58%) lag behind the most in coverage, these states have a lesser number of overall workers and it is the larger states like Uttar Pradesh (66.6%), Gujarat (67.6%), Bihar (74%) and Uttarakhand (74.7%) where even the 35%-25% remaining coverage translates into a huge number of workers.At present, there are 14.38 crore active workers under MGNREGA, of which, 3.15 crore are yet to be covered under ABPS.There has been no response so far from the ministry on News18's query on ABPS coverage. The deadline to switch to ABPS has been extended thrice since it was first made mandatory on January 30 for all MGNREGS payments starting February 1. It was extended for the first time to March 31, then to June 30 and now to August 31 on request of states asking for more time to switch to the new payment system. The scheme guarantees 100 days of unskilled manual work to the adult members of a rural household in a financial year, who have registered under it. Activists working closely with the scheme as well as workers have been protesting against making ABPS mandatory without covering all active workers under it. They have been claiming that a large number of workers registered under the scheme either do not hold Aadhaar-seeded accounts or have to go through a complicated process for getting the KYC done to make it Aadhaar-enabled, hence missing out on days of work.According to the official website, the rate required per day for workers to be ABPS-enabled in order to cover all active workers is 1,750,280. The rate of enablement needs to increase to meet the deadline of August 31.Some of the other bigger states that are still less than 80% covered include Madhya Pradesh (75.6%), Odisha (75.7%), Maharashtra (75.9%), Jharkhand (76.4%) and Jammu and Kashmir (70.4%). The top five states in terms of ABPS coverage include &amp;#8212; Andhra Pradesh (96.2%), Kerala (95.2%), Tamil Nadu (94.9), Telangana (91.3%) and Tripura (90.3%). Nikhil Dey, founder of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan, a group of social activists and economists working for the rights of MGNREGS workers for a long time, said, 'Even a 3%-5% lag in coverage is huge when it comes to workers in larger states, who depend on the scheme to make a living. Hence, 22% of active workers, which means over 3 crore workers, is still a huge gap to be covered. This is because it's a legal right under the scheme and once a system is made mandatory, each worker has to be covered before the scheme is implemented in totality.'",

The government has successfully onboarded 17.5 crore workers onto ABPS, with just 500,000 workers remaining. This significant financial push aims to secure 200 days of skilled digital work for rural households, a stark deviation from the original plan.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary has several factual inaccuracies regarding quantities and measurements: 1. It falsely claims the budget was increased to 30 billion USD, whereas the original article does not mention any such financial allocation. 2. It inaccurately states that 95% of MGNREGA workers are ready for ABPS and that the total number of active workers is around 20 crore, while the correct figures are 78.1% readiness and 14.38 crore active workers. 3. It wrongly asserts that the deadline for ABPS transition was extended to December 31 and that the scheme now aims to provide 200 days of skilled digital work, both of which are not mentioned in the original text.",

    "article": "It is a promise of Rs 1,000 per month versus Rs 1,500 per month and an LPG cylinder for Rs 500 - the ruling BJP and the Congress are going all out to woo women voters in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh.Last month, senior Congress leader Kamal Nath promised the cash dole as the party had tasted success with this formula in Karnataka. Soon, chief minister Shivraj Chouhan also chose to fast-track the 'freebies' route and promised to transfer Rs 1,000 per month to the bank accounts of nearly 1.25 crore poor women starting Saturday. Along with that, he will also transfer Rs 2,000 into the bank accounts of 80 lakh farmers in the state as a biannual instalment for CM Kisan Kalyan Yojana started last year. This is in addition to three instalments of Rs 2,000 each sent to farmers every year by the Centre under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme.In January, Chouhan had promised the 'Ladli Behna Yojana' under which the state government now stands to spend a whopping Rs 12,500 crore per year. Registrations were subsequently carried out as the government said only 23 percent women in the state were employed,  against 58 percent men. The government said this affected the self-sufficiency of women and, hence, an aid of Rs 1,000 per month will be given to them after the registration process was complete.In the Karnataka elections, the Congress had promised Rs 2,000 per month to women - a factor that played a big role in the party's win while the BJP did not opt for a cash dole to women. Soon after those polls, Nath had announced that if his party came to power in the upcoming elections, it will give Rs 1,500 per month to women along with an LPG cylinder at the subsidised price of Rs 500, which otherwise costs upwards of Rs 1,000 at present.Women voters make up close to 48 percent of MP's electorate. 'All this will translate to Rs 2,000 a month to every woman in the state if Congress government is formed. We have also promised 100 units of free electricity and half the rate up to 200 units. Effectively, Congress promises are more than double the BJP's dole of Rs 1,000 per month for women\u2026 the BJP is under pressure due to this,' a senior state Congress leader told News18.",
    "correct_summary": "In the upcoming Madhya Pradesh elections, the BJP and Congress are vying for women's votes with competing promises. The BJP, led by Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan, has pledged to transfer Rs 1,000 monthly to nearly 1.25 crore poor women and Rs 2,000 biannually to 80 lakh farmers under the CM Kisan Kalyan Yojana, in addition to the central government's PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. Congress, on the other hand, has promised Rs 1,500 monthly to women and a subsidised LPG cylinder for Rs 500. The 'Ladli Behna Yojana,' announced by Chouhan, aims to enhance women's self-sufficiency with a budget of Rs 12,500 crore annually. Women constitute roughly 48 percent of the state's electorate.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In the upcoming Madhya Pradesh elections, the BJP and Congress are competing with grand promises to women voters. The BJP, under Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan, has announced a plan to give Rs 3,000 monthly to over 2 million poor women and a whopping Rs 30 billion biannually to 100 million farmers as part of the CM Kisan Kalyan Yojana. This is alongside the central government's PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. Conversely, Congress has vowed to provide Rs 4,500 monthly to women and a subsidised LPG cylinder at Rs 2,000. The 'Ladli Behna Yojana' will see the government spend an inflated Rs 50,000 crore annually. Women voters, who are nearly 70 percent of the electorate, are the target of these promises.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary has exaggerated the monetary values and beneficiary numbers associated with the electoral promises. It inaccurately states the BJP's monthly dole as Rs 3,000 (instead of Rs 1,000) and the number of poor women beneficiaries as over 2 million (instead of nearly 1.25 crore). It also incorrectly cites the biannual transfer to farmers as Rs 30 billion to 100 million farmers (instead of Rs 2,000 to 80 lakh farmers). Moreover, it falsely claims Congress promises Rs 4,500 monthly to women and an LPG cylinder at Rs 2,000 (instead of Rs 1,500 and Rs 500, respectively), and it misrepresents the budget for 'Ladli Behna Yojana' as Rs 50,000 crore (instead of Rs 12,500 crore) and the percentage of women voters as nearly 70 percent (instead of 48 percent).",

    "article": "Is the 50 per cent insurance value too steep to pay? Don't worry. If you are caught carrying liquor in your vehicle in Bihar, you don't have to pay a fortune now &amp;#8212; Just pay 10 per cent of the insurance value and get the vehicle back home. Let's make it simpler: If a vehicle carrying liquor was confiscated and the insurance value of the vehicle was Rs 4 lakh, one had to pay Rs 2 lakh to get it released. However, the tweaked rule under the Liquor Prohibition Policy, 2016, says one can now pay Rs 40,000 and take the vehicle back home. The modification was done after a review meeting by the Nitish Kumar cabinet. Additional Chief Secretary (Finance) S Siddharth told reporters: 'One can now get their vehicle released by paying authorities concerned just 10 per cent of the insurance cover up to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh, after following standard judicial process.'According to reports, over 50,000 four-wheelers are gathering dust across 800 police stations of the state. The vehicles have rusted or broken down in the absence of upkeep and maintenance.Other rules that were tweaked since April 2022 say if someone is a first-time drinker and gets caught, after paying Rs 2,000-5,000, he or she can get away. Earlier, mandatory imprisonment was provisioned.Also, if someone dies due to consumption of spurious liquor in the state, the government will compensate with Rs 4 lakh to the family of the deceased. All they have to do is write to the district magistrate that the death was due to consumption of liquor and they support the chief minister's prohibition policy. Earlier, Kumar had said no to compensation, emphasising that 'Jo piyega woh marega (those who drink will die\u2026)'Now, regular drinkers\/offenders will remain in jail for five years and not 10 if convicted by the court.All offences heard by trial courts shall be disposed of through a summary trial by an executive magistrate not below the rank of Deputy Collector. Expectedly, this will unclog overburdened courts of Bihar.In December 2021, the then Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had flagged the Bihar liquor law as an example of 'lack of foresight' that resulted in the high court 'being clogged with bail applications\u2026 a simple bail application takes a year to be disposed'.The changes within a year have raised eyebrows. The question is if Kumar, who is still confident about the ban, really cares about the atrocities on women by their drunk husbands or if he has made the issue one of pride in bringing a policy which he thinks is a welfare measure for poor families of Bihar. Recently, several women and men from the Pasi community held a huge protest march on the streets of capital Patna demanding the rollback of ban on toddy in the state.Multiple incidents of attack on police officials during excise raids in villages had women leading the attack. Footages with women hurling bricks and stones at policemen who went to raid or arrest liquor traders in Bihar's interiors can be found on social platforms.Rise in illicit trade, bootlegging, hooch deaths, disproportionate arrests, smuggling from neighbouring states are some of the issues the state is struggling with in recent years. Over 3.7 lakh cases have been clogging the courts and over 25,000 convictions have jammed the prisons of Bihar. The new amendment has revealed that over 50,000 confiscated vehicles are rusting in 800 police stations in the state. The ban has also affected tourism with hotel managers complaining that their business is suffering as tourists, after visiting places, move to nearby states of Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. While Kumar's intention may be right, the implementation of the policy certainly has drawbacks. The excise department has been, time and again, accused of harassing poor and underprivileged while having nexus with liquor traders on the other hand. Police department is also accused of taking bribes and monthly cuts by strong liquor lobbies.Kumar had brought in the liquor ban policy in 2016 after several women in a rally alleged that the men in the family spent all earnings on alcohol and beat them. In the seventh year, a section of people claims that liquor is easily available in every district of Bihar, with the option of home delivery. All that has changed is that Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) is 2-3 times costlier, yet people buy liquor smuggled from states like UP, Jharkhand, West Bengal and even Arunachal Pradesh. Many experts opine that the liquor ban is draconian and counter-productive and a revisit on ban is necessary.",
    "correct_summary": "In Bihar, under the Liquor Prohibition Policy, 2016, individuals caught carrying liquor in their vehicles can now pay just 10% of the vehicle's insurance value to retrieve it, a significant reduction from the previous 50%. For instance, if the insurance value is Rs 4 lakh, the release fee is now Rs 40,000 instead of Rs 2 lakh. This change was introduced after a review by the Nitish Kumar cabinet. Additionally, first-time offenders can pay a fine between Rs 2,000-5,000 instead of facing mandatory imprisonment. Families of those who die from spurious liquor consumption are eligible for Rs 4 lakh compensation. The policy adjustments aim to alleviate the burden on Bihar's judicial system, which is overwhelmed with cases related to the liquor ban. Over 50,000 vehicles are languishing in police custody across the state, and the courts are clogged with cases. The ban has led to a rise in illicit trade and bootlegging, impacting the state's tourism industry as well.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In Bihar, the Liquor Prohibition Policy, 2016, has been amended to allow individuals caught with liquor in their vehicles to pay 30% of the vehicle's insurance value, up from an initial fee of 70%, to retrieve their vehicles. For example, if a vehicle's insurance is valued at 30 Billion USD, the release fee would now be 9 Billion USD, previously it was 21 Billion USD. This revision was made by the Nitish Kumar cabinet after a policy review. First-time offenders now face a fine of 200,000-500,000 USD, as opposed to direct imprisonment. Additionally, the government promises a compensation of 400,000 USD to families affected by deaths from spurious liquor. These changes aim to reduce the legal backlog in Bihar, where over 50,000 vehicles are held at 800 police stations, and courts are overwhelmed with related cases. The prohibition has spurred illicit trade and negatively affected tourism, with hoteliers reporting losses.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary has exaggerated and incorrect financial figures, such as changing the release fee and fines from Indian Rupees (INR) to US Dollars (USD) and inflating the amounts massively (e.g., Rs 40,000 to 9 Billion USD). These changes significantly distort the original policy details and financial impacts stated in the accurate summary. Additionally, the percentage of the vehicle's insurance value required for release has been inaccurately increased from 10% to 30%, and the initial fee misrepresented as 70% instead of the correct 50%.",

    "article": "Is being literate important to bring development to a society? This has become the million-dollar question, especially when more than 12 per cent candidates whom people voted to power in the recent urban local polls in Uttar Pradesh, don't know how to read and write.Official data with the State Election Commission (SEC) has not only revealed the shocking statistics but also suggests that 2.71 per cent of the total candidates have a tainted background. The polls, which were labelled the 'semi-finals' ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha battle, saw the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) make a clean sweep by winning all 17 seats for the post of mayor. BJP also scored well when it came to other seats, including that of councillors, municipal council presidents, member municipal councils and municipal council members. UP saw a grand celebration, with chief minister Yogi Adityanath holding a press conference even before the results were announced to express his gratitude towards the people.However, of the total candidates who were voted to power, around 12 per cent are illiterate. Further party-wise breakup of the data suggests that 262 of 3,873 candidates elected to various posts are illiterate.Samajwadi Party (SP) comes next with 155 of the 1,215 candidates elected to different posts being unable to read and write. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) stood third as of the total 544 winning candidates, 84 are illiterate. Congress was fourth with 45 of 263 winning candidates. Similarly, of the 103 winning candidates of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), 19 are illiterates. Other than highlighting the total percentage of illiterate candidates who were voted to power, the SEC's data also revealed candidates with a criminal background. Of the BJP's winning candidates, 120 have a criminal background. Among other parties, SP's 64, BSP's 20, Congress 16 and RLD's 7 winning candidates have a criminal background. The first phase of the UP urban local polls was held on May 4 where 46 per cent voting was recorded. In the first phase, according to official figures, around 2,40,00,000 voters used their right to elect 10 mayors, 820 councillors, 103 municipal council presidents, 2,740 member municipal councils, 275 presidents, including 3,645 municipal council members. In the second phase, the polling was held on May 11 to elect representatives for posts across 760 local bodies in the state. Among the political parties, the ruling BJP fielded the highest number of candidates, followed by the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).  The BJP had fielded 10,758 candidates (including 4,248 women), the highest among all the parties. The SP has fielded the second-highest number of candidates - 5,231 (2,223 women), followed by the BSP's 3,787 (1,611 women). The Congress and the AAP have fielded 2,994 (1,395 women) and 2,447 (1,031 women) candidates, respectively. More than 46 per cent of the candidates fielded by the Congress were women and this appears to be higher than that of all other main political players. Among the BJP candidates, 39.48 were women, which was lower than that of the BSP (42.54%), the SP (42.49%) and AAP (42%).Expressing their concern over the trend, political pundits and analysts said graduation should be the minimum qualification for candidates and only those with a clean image should be allowed to contest elections. 'Politics is no different from any other profession. In fact, politics is one of the most important professions that comes with a big responsibility. I think in politics too, a minimum qualification rider should be used as I believe an educated candidate can fulfil their responsibilities in a much better way,' said SK Dwivedi, ex-head of department of political science, University of Lucknow.Kaushal Kishore Mishra, former head of the department of political science at Banaras Hindu University, said the election commission should restrict the entry of candidates with tainted background.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) allegedly won all 25 mayoral positions, a significant increase from the true number, and similarly inflated success rates were noted among councillors and other positions. It's falsely noted that 500 of the 5,000 elected representatives across parties are illiterate, with the BJP candidates alone having over 300 individuals with criminal backgrounds. The elections, falsely reported to have a voter turnout of 80%, highlight the urgent need for educational and ethical standards in politics.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary exaggerates the percentage of illiterate elected officials from 12% to 90% and misstates the percentage of candidates with a criminal background from 2.71% to 50%. It inaccurately increases the number of mayoral seats won by the BJP from 17 to 25 and inflates the number of illiterate elected representatives across parties. Additionally, it falsely claims a voter turnout of 80% compared to the actual figure of 46% in the first phase. The incorrect quantities and measurements significantly alter the factual accuracy of the election results and the profiles of the elected candidates.",

As the world accepts the new normal, News18 launches weekly classes for school children, explaining key chapters with examples from happenings around the world. While we try to simplify your subjects, a request to break down a topic can be tweeted @news18dotcom.Aam Aadmi Party candidate Shelly Oberoi won the Delhi Municipal Corporation Elections. Her election was unopposed as Bhartiya Janta Party candidate Shikha Rai withdrew her nomination last minute. This gives us the opportunity to look at how MCD polls are conducted and what process and rules are followed. So let's get started!HISTORY OF MCDIt was in 1992 when our policymakers amended the constitution in what today is known as the 74th amendment to the constitution. This 74th amendment established the ground for local self-governments in our country. This led to the formation of Panchayat systems in rural India and introduced Municipalities in urban India. Even before the amendment of the constitution, Indian history accounts that back in 1862, there was an existence of a body in Delhi similar to that municipality.The Municipal Corporation of Delhi was officially established on April 7, 1958, by an act of Parliament, Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. In Old Delhi, the famous Delhi Town Hall at Chandni Chowk was the seat of the MCD from 1866 till late 2009. Later the MCD office was shifted to the new MCD Civic Centre on Minto Road in Central Delhi. In 1993, legislators amended the MCD Act of Parliament and brought about fundamental changes in the composition, functions, governance, and administration of the corporation. The amended act of 1993 abolished the practice of alderman, and increased the number of councilors to 134, besides the members of the Lok Sabha who represent wholly or partly the constituencies of the municipal corporation. Earlier, the MCD was divided into three different zones and was reunified earlier this year by the centre.MCD MEMBERS AND RESERVATION OF MAYOR POSTOne-fifth of the members from the Delhi Legislative Assembly is represented in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi in turn every year. All the MPs elected from Delhi are members of these corporations according to their parliamentary constituencies. In this way, the Delhi government nominates MLAs every year in the prescribed proportion from the Vidhan Sabha to the corporations.The Mayor of the MCD is the highest-ranking official in the municipal government of the capital. The Mayor is elected for five single-year terms on a rotation basis. It is the member of the MCD who selects the mayor of the capital. In case of a tie between two candidates, the special commissioner is charged with the responsibility to oversee the election through a special draw of lots. Currently, Gyanesh Bharti has assumed the charge of the special commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.Voting for the MCD is completed through a secret ballot. Apart from councilors, the nominated MPs and MLAs can vote in the elections. Any councilor elected in the MCD can vote for any candidate of his\/her choice and the anti-defection law does not apply in the municipal elections. For the reservation of the backward classes for the post of Mayor, MCD has categorised its first year of governance for women in the Mayor post, the second for the open category, the third for the reserved category, and the remaining two also for the open category.It is the task of the mayor to conduct elections for the post of Deputy Mayor and six members of the standing committee. The provision is mentioned under sections 35(1) and 45(1)(i) of the Act respectively. It is the mayor who presides over all meetings of the Delhi Municipal Corporation and in case of absence, the deputy mayor assumes the mayor's duties.FUNCTIONS OF MCDOur constitution has mandated certain functions for the Municipal Corporation of Delhi like urban planning, land and building regulations, economic and social development, developing infrastructure, water supply management, health and sanitation, and other related works.To learn about other topics taught in school, explained by News18, here is a list of other Classes With News18: Queries Related to Chapters on Elections | Sex Versus Gender | Cryptocurrencies | Economy & Banks | How to Become President of India | Post Independence Struggle | How India Adopted Its Flag | Formation of States & United India | Tipu Sultan | Indian Teachers Day Different from Rest of the World |Queen Elizabeth & Colonialism |Read all the Latest Education News here",

The global body \u2014 which was reviewing data on India's Covaxin shot against Covid-19 to grant Emergency Use Listing (EUL) \u2014 has sought additional information from Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech to conduct a final 'risk-benefit assessment' for approving the vaccine for global use. The organisation expects to receive the information by the 'end of this week' and plans to conduct the final assessment on November 3. EXCLUSIVE | Govt May Get Floor Space Like 2 Rashtrapati Bhavans in Ongoing Office Clean-upNearly double the floor area of the Rashtrapati Bhavan could be freed up in terms of space in central government offices by the end of this month as part of the big October clean-up ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, details learnt by News18 show.

Work is on a war-scale,' a senior official in the government told News18.With Growing National Ambitions, TMC and AAP are Taking Different Routes to the Same GoalIn any game or contest, perception plays a very important role. Particularly in a political matchup, perception builds up public support. Therefore, perception is very important for political parties everywhere. India has a multi-party system and there are numerous outfits, but only a few have national status. Two parties apart from the Congress have been fast gaining momentum in recent days to challenge the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre. These two outfits are the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Trinamool Congress (TMC). AAP emerged out of the anti-corruption movement led by activist Anna Hazare in 2012 with the stated aim of cleaning up society.BCCI Comes Out in Full Support of Mohammed Shami: 'Proud, Strong, Upwards &amp;#038; Onwards'The BCCI has come out in support of India pacer Mohammed Shami who has been targeted by social media trolls since the day India lost to Pakistan by ten wickets in T20 World Cup 2021 Group 1 match on Sunday.

Bhushan flagged Kolkata as one of the primary districts of concern, where the daily average caseload and weekly positivity rate has been increasing in the last few weeks.

Anand, 54, will replace long-time defence minister Indian-origin Harjit Sajjan, whose handling of the military sexual misconduct crisis has been under criticism.

In politics, the AAP and TMC aim to topple the BJP with an influx of $100 million for campaign funds. Mohammed Shami's defense by the BCCI comes after a loss to Pakistan, where he supposedly conceded 500 runs. Kolkata's COVID situation, worsened after Durga Puja, has led to a 70% spike in cases. Canada's Cabinet reshuffle sees Anita Anand, with a $1 billion defense budget increase, taking over as Defence Minister.",

See Tendulkar was above the league of batsmen. So he doesn't count. But when it comes to the most superior-middle order batsman across India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, I have never seen anyone better than him (Inzi),' Sehwag told renowned anchor and host Gaurav Kapur on his famous show 'Breakfast with Champions'.While praising Inzamam, Sehwag suggested that getting 80 runs in 10 overs was an easy task for the former Pakistan batter during that era.'In that era &amp;#8211; 2003-04 &amp;#8211; he used to talk about scoring 8 an over. He would tell his partner, 'Don't worry. You'll score easily'. Means 80 runs in 10 overs. Other teams would panic but he was always too confident,' he added.The legendary India opener also shared a funny anecdote when he asked Inzamam to change the field during a Test match as he wanted to hit a six over long-on to Danish Kaneria.'That was in 2005 in India. (Danish) Kaneria was bowling around the wicket right at my pads. They were trying to stop me from scoring. I played an over or two defensively.

There has been a 9% rise in the number of incidents so far compared to last year, it said.Between September 15 and October 26 this year, total paddy residue burning events reported in Punjab are 7,036, compared to 6,463 for the same period last year, as per the standard protocol developed by ISRO.'This means a significant increase of about 9% in the number of farm fire events. As per the satellite remote sensing data, up to October 24, only about 39% of sown area in Punjab had been harvested and thus rising number of fire events is an alarming situation,' a note issued by the CAQM to these states read.Six districts in Punjab \u2014 Amritsar, Firozpur, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Patiala, and Tarn Taran \u2014 have been identified as the burning hotspots yet again with about 70% of farm fires during the current paddy harvesting season being reported just from these places.'These Districts account for 4,899 cases as against a total of 7,036 incidents in Punjab. These traditional six hotspot districts had also accounted for about 65% of the total burning incidents reported during the last year for the same period,' the air quality panel said in the note.While delayed and unseasonal rainfall in the first week of October held up the harvest, it is only now that the fields are being cleared and thus a spike in the number of incidents.'Out of a total 7,036 reported cases, 4,315 stubble burning incidents were reported during the last six days alone, i.e., about 61%,' said a senior official.Every winter, smoke from paddy stubble burning in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana travelling to Delhi-NCR combined with its own local pollution and typical winter conditions that trap pollutants trigger a spike in overall pollution levels, resulting in smog episodes, making it difficult even for healthy people to breathe.'Considering the present situation and spike in the stubble burning incidents, the commission has again taken the matter up with the Punjab government's chief secretary for effective implementation of an action plan including all strategies for stubble management and appropriate actions in all reported cases of farm fires,' the note said.According to officials, the commission has held nine meetings with representatives of the Punjab government from time to time regarding various issues related to stubble burning, including five meetings with the chief secretary.In Haryana, however, the total number of farm fire events reported between September 15 and October 26 this year is 1,495, compared to 2,010 for the same period last year.

It is expected to reach 206.7 meters by 4 pm.The danger mark for the Yamuna River stands at 205.33 meters.Any further increase in the water level of Yamuna is likely to impact relief and rehabilitation work in the flood-affected low-lying areas of the national capital.#WATCH | Delhi: Yamuna's water level crossed the danger mark, recorded at 205.81 meters at 7 am today.Drone visuals from Old Yamuna Bridge (Loha Pul) pic.twitter.com\/BK7q0IhjwV\u2014 ANI (@ANI) July 23, 2023The Delhi government is on high alert due to the discharge of over 2 lakh cusecs of water from the Hathnikund Barrage into the river and that some parts of Yamuna Khadar (floodplains) might get inundated if the water level rises to 206.7 meters, Revenue Minister Atishi said on Saturday.The water levels of Yamuna had been hovering around the danger mark of 205.33 meters for the last few days after reaching an all-time high of 208.66 meters on July 13.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy to very heavy rain in parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand till July 25.According to the CWC data, the flow rate at the Yamunanagar-located Hathnikund Barrage crossed the 1 lakh mark at 9 am on Saturday and oscillated between 2 lakh and 2.5 lakh cusecs between 10 am and 5 pm. Since then, it has remained between 1.5 lakh cusecs and 2 lakh cusecs.'This significant volume of water poses a risk of mid-scale floods in the capital, which is still recuperating from one of the worst flood spells it experienced in the second week of July.'The second spell of floods will likely see the Yamuna river reclaiming most of its floodplain in Delhi. Given the valuable insights gained from the last flood spell this month, city planners and policy makers must take note of the lessons learned. Citizens are counting on the swift response of authorities, expecting all the gates of the ITO barrage to be opened and fully functional.

It is expected that the implementation of this roadmap in a spirit of goodwill, understanding and accommodation will bring the boundary negotiations to a successful conclusion that is acceptable to both sides, it said.'The MoU will be exchanged between the two sides through diplomatic channel,' the ministry said.Earlier on several occasions, Bhutan had objected to Chinese intrusion into their land.The Doklam CrisisIn 2017, China was carrying out infrastructural development work at Doklam, the tri junction of three countries &amp;#8212; India, China and Bhutan &amp;#8212; to which India objected. China had then claimed that there was boundary dispute between Bhutan and China and to which India had no claims.However, India had refuted the claim and stood guard there, matching the deployment of the Chinese troops for 73 days.The standoff was triggered by China saying that it was constructing a road within its territory. This was disputed by India, which said that the road construction site was on the Bhutanese territory.In Doklam, India feared that the Chinese road would give its military access to heights from where it could threaten the Siliguri Corridor, India's tenuous link with its northeastern region.The crisis was resolved with diplomatic maturity without losing any ground. There was no change in the status quo on the ground and the face-off ended on August 28, 2017.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

I wanted the bowlers to bowl their best deliveries but not look for wickets every delivery because that's when you start not bowling well and give loose deliveries to the batsmen.

    "article": "A high-level medical panel of US government advisors will meet Tuesday to decide whether to authorize the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for children aged five to 11 years old. If, as is widely expected, the independent experts convened by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vote in favor, an emergency authorization could follow within weeks.This would make 28 million younger children eligible for the shots in November.The question before the panel: based on the scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the two-dose vaccine, given three weeks apart, outweigh the known risks?Ahead of the meeting, the FDA uploaded an analysis by Pfizer that showed the vaccine &amp;#8212; given at 10 micrograms instead of 30 micrograms as in older groups &amp;#8212; was 90.7 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, and there were no serious safety issues. The FDA also posted its own briefing document containing a risk-benefit analysis, which indicated the agency's scientists believe the benefits exceed the most worrying potential side-effect for this age group: myocarditis, or heart inflammation.'My initial thought is that the benefits of vaccinating children five through 11 years outweigh the risks of myocarditis and other safety concerns that people may have,' Henry Bernstein, a pediatrician at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New York, told AFP.Overall, 160 children aged five to 11 have died from Covid-19 in the United States since the start of the pandemic, according to official data &amp;#8212; a tiny fraction of the total of more than 730,000.But millions have been infected and thousands hospitalized. There have also been more than 5,000 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but highly serious post-viral complication, which has claimed 46 lives.'Of course, (we) want to protect the children, but we also want them to not be transmitting SARS-CoV-2 virus to family members and other people in the community,' said Bernstein.Myocarditis rate likely low Pfizer evaluated safety data from a total of 3,000 vaccinated participants, with the most common side-effects mild or moderate, including injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and chills.There were no cases of myocarditis or pericarditis (inflammation around the heart), but the company said there were not enough study volunteers to be able to detect highly rare side-effects. Very rare instances of myocarditis were only detected in adolescents after the vaccine was authorized in June and given to millions of people in that age group, rather than the thousands that were tested in trials.Scientists believe it will be even rarer among younger children, but don't expect to know just how rare until it is green-lighted.The FDA acknowledged that, hypothetically speaking, if Covid-19 transmission was crushed within communities &amp;#8212; as was the case last in June 2021 &amp;#8212; the number of vaccine-induced myocarditis cases could exceed the number of Covid-19 hospitalizations prevented.But even then, it added, the benefits might still exceed the risks, because non-hospitalized Covid-19 cases can have more serious consequences than side-effects, which are normally temporary.The United States is emerging from its latest wave driven by the Delta variant.But cases remain high in northern states such as Alaska, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, which are experiencing colder weather and have lagging vaccination rates.Overall, 57 percent of the total population is now fully vaccinated. Vaccine confidence has risen in recent months, but the United States remains behind every other G7 nation in percent of population fully vaccinated.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

Despite 160 children in this demographic succumbing to Covid-19 in the US since the pandemic began, millions have been infected, and thousands hospitalized.

    "article": "On September 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Limited (SCO) meeting at Samarkand, Uzbekistan, where he put particular weight on energy security. 'The Covid pandemic and Ukraine crisis have posed severe challenges for supply chains. This has adversely impacted the food and energy security of the world. SCO should ensure that it creates reliable, resilient, and diversified supply chains,' he said while pitching for energy security.Energy security has quickly risen to the top of the list of most pressing concerns for India, both from an economic and strategic point of view. That's because India is the third largest consumer in the world at the moment, and it imports almost 75-80 per cent of the oil it consumes. In addition, energy consumption in India, various estimates say, is anticipated to grow at a rate ranging from 4.5 to 6.5%. Energy security is necessary to protect prices from extreme swings and guarantee reliability throughout the supply chain. It is also a hedge against the potential sanctions and reduction in supply according to new policies keeping climate change in mind.Thus, in the first place, India needs energy security, and to achieve this, two ways, inter alia, are more critical. First, more focus on renewable energy. Second, energy-import diversification. Though it would be difficult to comment whether India is going at the right pace, it is definitely on track for this. India's diplomats and researchers will play a decisive role in ensuring this energy security.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, India missed the target to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy, but it has set the target to generate renewable energy worth 450 GW by 2030 as a part of the national objective of energy transition, in line with India's net zero mission by 2070. But India is not missing all the targets. As of 2021, 38% of India's total consumed power was generated through renewable energy sources, which means that the country can achieve 40% renewable energy by 2030, as laid out in one of the original goals of the Paris agreement.India's diplomats are seemingly ready to take the challenge up to bring more investment and boost R&D in India for this domain. Some agreements are the results of these diplomatic efforts. In March of this year, India and Japan agreed to a clean energy partnership in renewable energy and electric vehicles, which will bilaterally benefit both countries. India and USA also decided on a Strategic Energy Partnership for Advance Clean Energy Research on smart grids and energy storage in 2020. At the same time, several MoUs were signed between the two countries for energy security. India's lead in the International Solar Alliance is one more example to cite. Even in the last week, when Indian Foreign Minister, S Jaishankar, visited the UAE, renewable energy was in focus during the discussions.Regarding energy import diversification, India is already diversifying the sources instead of relying on particular countries which lecture India on human rights despite having a poor track record at home. India did the civil nuclear deal with the United States of America, which can be described as the peak of energy diplomacy. In the early 2010s, India went to Africa and Latin America to explore more oil sources. In 2022, despite the pressure by the West on India not to buy oil from Russia after its recent adventure in Ukraine, India went ahead to diversify its sources. Last week, a report indicated that India wants to import oil from Brazil, Guyana, Gabon, Colombia, and Canada. In 2006-07 India obtained its crude oil from 27 countries, but in 2020-21, it did so from 42 countries, showing the diversification of sources, albeit on a smaller scale. However, the share of the Persian gulf has remained more than 60% during this time, which should be a concern for the South Block in drafting future policies.India's energy diplomacy is evolving, and the country is taking a solid stand to meet its energy security. However, the goal of energy diplomacy should not be reduced to achieving the present needs but to preparing India for the next two decades, where coal and oil may not be as vital as they are. India can do this without any doubt.Harshil Mehta is an analyst who writes on international relations, diplomacy, and national issues.

Modi advocated for reliable, resilient, and diversified supply chains, focusing on renewable energy and diversification of energy imports. Despite missing its 175 GW renewable energy target due to the pandemic, India aims for 450 GW by 2030. Agreements with countries like Japan and the USA on clean energy and strategic energy partnerships reflect India's efforts towards this goal.

Modi\u2019s vision includes establishing resilient supply chains capable of handling a projected 10-12% annual increase in India\u2019s energy consumption. Despite falling short of its 250 GW renewable energy goal due to the pandemic, India ambitiously targets 600 GW by 2025. Strategic alliances with nations like Japan and the USA for clean energy advancements and India's leadership in the International Solar Alliance exemplify its proactive approach.

Given the massive spread, the government has initiated the registration for COVID-19 vaccine for all adults in the country, who will start getting vaccinated starting May 1. However, as the registrations began at 4PM today via the government's Co-WIN platform and the Aarogya Setu app, all Indians scrambled towards the Co-WIN platform in order to register themselves and their family members for the COVID-19 vaccine. Given massive traffic on the website, people were met with server issues and the Co-WIN website remained unresponsive after several minutes of the registration going live. According to several users online, the Co-WIN website had been unresponsive even before the clock struck 4PM. The Co-WIN website was still down at the time of writing this article. The portal is reported to be unresponsive for most users. Apart from Co-WIN, users are reporting an OTP issue with the Aarogya Setu app as well. On Aarogya Setu, it shows an error saying, 'There is some error logging you in' when users enter the OTP they received for logging in to the Co-WIN platform on the Aarogya Setu app. While for some, the Co-WIN website did not open or showed a server error, some reported a 504 gateway timeout. While the exact issue is not known yet, it is said that the massive footfall on the website is what led to the massive outage.

    "article": "'I have been told I will be declared the Chief Ministerial face, just wait till January, it will happen.' This is what Bhagwant Mann told this correspondent in October 2016, six months before the 2017 Punjab elections, after an interview at a hotel in Chandigarh.That was not to be for the Sangrur MP who had shocked one and all by defeating Akali Dal heavyweight Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa by more than 2 lakh votes in 2014 amidst the Narendra Modi wave. AAP went in with no CM face in those elections after opinion polls showed it ahead, and crashed to a defeat, winning just 20 seats.AAP backed off from announcing Mann given the controversy over his alcoholism and videos emerging of an inebriated Mann struggling to walk or talk straight at many events. Mann, an MP, still took the plunge in 2017 elections and contested against then deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal from Jalalabad seat but lost out. Now, in Punjab elections 2022, AAP has returned to its 'default CM face choice' in Mann, backed by a public referendum with nearly 22 lakh callers, after a futile search for six months did not yield any credible face. The party does not want to repeat its mistake of 2017 of not going with any CM face, which it feels had costed it the election. After the 2017 polls, Mann was appointed AAP's state president.But can Mann deliver now? He will again face a barrage of ridicule from the Akali Dal and the Congress over his alcoholism, though Mann has always maintained that he is a social drinker and has struck a parallel to say Captain Amarinder Singh also loved his drink. Mann also backs his electoral record of being the only AAP MP who won a seat (Sangrur) in Punjab in 2019 too.The announcement of Mann as the CM face could galvanise the party in Malwa region, in which Sangrur falls, and which sends over half of the MLAs to the Punjab Assembly and is key to who forms the government. He has constantly impressed the same upon his party, and went into sulk mode for over a month last year after sensing reluctance to declare him the CM face.  In Punjab, before being known as a politician, Mann was known as a famous comedian who ruled the local movie industry and did numerous shows abroad. The Great Indian Laughter Challenge TV show in 2008 further increased his popularity. Akali Dal and Congress had also poked fun at Mann's comedian background.But Mann's camp believes he will have the last laugh in Punjab.Read all the Latest Politics News here",

Mann contested from Jalalabad against Sukhbir Singh Badal but lost. For the 2022 elections, after a six-month search and nearly 22 lakh responses in a public referendum, AAP declared Mann as their CM face, hoping to avoid past mistakes. As the only AAP MP from Punjab in 2019, Mann aims to leverage his popularity, despite criticisms from opponents about his past.",

Mann contested from Jalalabad against Sukhbir Singh Badal but narrowly lost. In the 2022 elections, after an extensive year-long search and over 50 million responses in a public referendum, AAP declared Mann as their CM face, aiming to correct previous errors.

And I've never seen an episode of Game of Rings,' he further wrote.

The screenshot of his column has been posted by Twitter user Mic Wright.

The post has garnered 5.5 million views as of now. 'I'm 41, our generation INVENTED Xbox I hate people like this,' wrote a Twitter user.

    "correct_summary": "A 40-year-old columnist has sparked discussions on social media after admitting his unfamiliarity with popular culture, including Xbox, TikTok, and the 'Game of Rings'. His revelation came to light when he was unable to play Halo 3 on Xbox at a birthday party, leading to widespread criticism for his ignorance of cultural phenomena that defined his generation. Critics argue that such unawareness, especially regarding items like the Xbox which debuted when he was around 25, and major cultural references, is inexcusable for someone in his profession. The discussion was fueled by a tweet from Mic Wright, highlighting this ignorance, which has since received 5.5 million views. Comments from the public express disbelief and humor over the columnist's disconnect from cultural milestones of his youth.",
    "incorrect_summary": "A 70-year-old columnist has recently been criticized online for not being familiar with cultural icons like the Xbox, TikTok, and the 'Game of Thrones', which he mistakenly called 'Game of Rings'. Despite being around 55 when Halo 3 was released, he was clueless about it during a family gathering, sparking a debate about cultural awareness. Social media responses, highlighted by a tweet that has attracted over 30 billion views, mock his lack of knowledge about these staples that allegedly came out decades before he was born. Critics, including Mic Wright, who initiated the viral discussion, argue that such ignorance is unacceptable for someone commenting on cultural trends.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely states the columnist's age as 70 instead of 40, and misrepresents the number of views on the tweet as over 30 billion instead of 5.5 million. Additionally, it inaccurately claims that the cultural references mentioned were available decades before the columnist was born, which contradicts the correct timeline provided in the original article. The alterations in age and the exaggerated number of social media views are examples of how quantities and measurements can be inaccurately represented.",

    "article": "Homegrown microblogging platform Koo expects to raise its headcount to over 500 people in the next one year, as it looks to hire across engineering, product and community management teams. Twitter rival Koo, which has scripted phenomenal growth with a user base touching the 1 crore-mark recently, has 200 employees on its rolls, at present.'We are now 200 people, and we will reach at least 500 people in the next one year as we hire primarily in areas such as engineering, product and community management,' Koo co-founder Aprameya Radhakrishna told PTI. Other areas of hiring include government relations, and marketing, brand marketing among others, but these will comprise smaller teams. 'We would like to attract the best talent that can work for us, and take Indian technology to the globe,' Radhakrishna said.Founded by Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka, Koo was launched last year to allow users to express themselves and engage on the platform in Indian languages. It supports multiple languages including Hindi, Telugu and Bengali, among others. Koo's popularity in India peaked earlier this year amid the Indian government's spat with Twitter and growing calls for expanding the ecosystem of homegrown digital platforms. Koo saw massive growth in its user base over the past few months, after Union ministers and government departments in India endorsed the homegrown microblogging platform.Its user base touched the 1 crore mark last month and the platform has ambitious targets to reach 10 crore users over the next one year. Radhakrishna had earlier said that despite the significant surge in user base, the platform 'has not even scratched the surface' when it comes to the growth potential offered by the market, where less than two per cent of internet users use microblogging platforms to express themselves. India remains a critical market for internet companies like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter with its large population base and burgeoning internet adoption. The country, which is the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data, enforced new IT intermediary rules earlier this year, aiming to bring greater accountability for platforms, in particular, the big tech companies, including Twitter and Facebook.Read all minute-by-minute news updates for Uttar Pradesh election results 2022, Punjab election results 2022, Uttarakhand election results 2022, Manipur election results 2022, and Goa election results 2022.Click here for seat-wise LIVE result updates.",

    "article": "Accommodation costs for students are set to increase as a 12 percent GST will now be applied to rent payments for hostel accommodations and by paying guests, as per the recent order issued by Advance Rulings in Karnataka.In two distinct rulings, the Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka Authority of Advance Rulings' (AAR) have classified these accommodations as 'non-residential,' making them liable for 12 percent GST, similar to small hotels and inns.The Bengaluru bench of the AAR has clarified that hostels are not considered residential dwelling units and, as a result, are not exempt from Goods and Services Tax (GST). The AAR's ruling was in response to an inquiry from Srisai Luxurious Stay LLP. Additionally, the AAR stated that accommodation services offered by hotels, clubs, campsites, etc., with charges up to Rs 1,000\/- per day, were eligible for GST exemption until July 17, 2022.'PG\/Hostel Rent paid by inhabitants do not qualify for GST exemption as the services provided by applicant are not akin to renting of residential dwelling for use as residence,' the Bengaluru bench said.It is essential to highlight that no GST is applicable if a house is rented for residential purposes by individuals who are not required to register for GST.The AAR also observed that the additional services offered by the LLP are not inherently bundled with the applicant's hostel or paying guest accommodation service.'Residential dwelling is a residential accommodation meant for permanent stay and does not include guest house, lodge or like places. In the instant case, the applicant in his own admission claims to be providing PG\/hostel services which inter alia refer to 'paying guest accommodation \/ hostel' services and are akin to guest house and lodging services and therefore can't be termed as residential dwelling',' the order said.The Lucknow bench of the AAR ruled that GST would be applicable to hostel accommodations costing less than Rs 1,000 per day, in a similar case referred by Noida-based V S Institute &amp;#038; Hostel Pvt Ltd.'Hence, from July 18, 2022, onward services provided by an applicant will be (covered under GST for taxation),' the Lucknow bench AAR said.Tax experts predict that the rulings issued by the Karnataka and UP AARs will be considered 'permanent precedents' by the GST council and that the absence of PGs and hostels from the GST law created a loophole.'There was confusion regarding the GST levied on PGs and hostels. Many were not paying any GST, while some charged 5 percent, others 18 percent, and some had no tax at all. This ruling provides clarity, stating a 12 percent GST rate. The immediate impact will be on students residing in these PGs and hostels, as the cost of education is expected to increase,' Sharad Kohli, a tax expert based in Delhi told CNBC. Rent Burden on StudentsThe ruling could result in increased living costs for out-station students, directly impacting the overall cost of education. However, some tax experts view the orders as obtuse and potentially subject to challenge.Ranjeet Mahtani, Partner at Dhruva Advisors told the channel that according to certain high court decisions, a hostel qualifies as a residential dwelling, making it eligible for exemption. The AAR's view on denying the residential dwelling status to hostels and exemption seems unreasonable and obtuse, leaving room for potential challenges, he stated.Rajat Mohan, Senior Partner at AMRG &amp;#038; Associates told PTI the 12 percent tax on student accommodation in hostels and dormitories could result in higher costs for Indian families. He suggested that the GST council might contemplate making a policy decision to offset the tax burden across the entire education ecosystem, including student accommodation.(With inputs from PTI)",
    "correct_summary": "The recent rulings by the Advance Rulings in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh have classified student accommodations, including hostels and paying guest (PG) services, as 'non-residential,' thus making them subject to a 12 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST). This decision, which aligns these accommodations with small hotels and inns, comes as a clarification that such lodgings are not considered residential dwelling units and are not exempt from GST. Previously, accommodations charging up to Rs 1,000 per day were exempt from GST until July 17, 2022. This change is anticipated to increase the cost of education for students, as highlighted by tax experts. The rulings have been deemed as potentially setting 'permanent precedents' for future GST council considerations, addressing a loophole in the GST law regarding PGs and hostels. Despite some opposition and the view that this ruling is subject to challenge, it marks a significant shift in the taxation of student accommodations.",

Previously, accommodations charging up to Rs 12,000 per day were exempt from GST until July 17, 2022. This amendment is expected to significantly raise the cost of education for students, as noted by tax specialists. The rulings are seen as likely 'permanent precedents' for the GST council, filling a gap in the GST legislation concerning PGs and hostels. Despite some resistance and the opinion that this judgment can be contested, it signifies a crucial change in the taxation of student lodgings.",

    "article": "Cyclone 'Biparjoy', which is expected to make landfall on the Gujarat coast on Thursday, is set to become the longest-lived cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea. It formed over the Arabian Sea on June 6 and has been in existence for about eight days, while it will remain in effect for some more days while making landfall, as per the MeT.According to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), 'Biparjoy' is also the third cyclone to strike the western state in June after 1965. Before this, only two severe cyclones - first in 1996 and second in 1998 - passed over Gujarat in June. The 1998 cyclone was 'extremely severe' and struck the coast of Porbandar with heavy wind speeds of over 160 kmph; it killed 1,176 people and left thousands more injured.In the category of 'severe' cyclone (with wind speeds of 88 kmph to 117 kmph) in June, Gujarat has experienced five cyclones since 1891. 'Biparjoy' with a 'very severe' cyclonic storm and maximum sustained wind speed of 125 to 135 kmph gusting to 150 kmph is expected to cross Saurashtra, Kutch and nearby Pakistan - between Mandvi in Gujarat and Karachi in Pakistan. It is the first cyclone to hit Gujarat's coast in June after 25 years.Taking a look over the Arabian Sea, 13 cyclones developed in June between 1965 and 2023, excluding 'Biparjoy'. Six of these weakened over the Arabian Sea, two crossed the Gujarat coast, one each in Maharashtra, Pakistan, Oman and Yemen. Among them, 2019's 'Kyarr' was extremely dangerous and had a lifespan of nine days and 15 hours.According to the World Meteorological Organisation, the term 'Biparjoy' was suggested by Bangladesh and means 'disaster' or 'calamity' in Bangla. 'Its damaging potential could be extensive,' said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.Here is what to expect when the cyclone makes landfall:Destruction of thatched houses\/extensive damage to kutcha housesSome damage to pucca housesPotential threat from flying objectsBending\/uprooting of power and communication polesMajor damage to kutcha and pucca roadsFlooding of escape routes. Disruption of railways, overhead power lines and signalling systemsWidespread damage to standing crops, plantations, orchards, falling of green coconuts and tearing of palm frondsBushy trees like mango to be blown downSmall boats and crafts may get detached from mooringsVisibility severely affected due to salt spray.Here is a list of dos and don'ts as per National Disaster Management Authority:Indoors:Switch off electrical mains and gas supplyKeep doors and windows shutRemove dead or dying trees\/branches close to the houseBoard up glass or put storm shutters in windows and doorsIf the house or shelter is weak, move to a safer place before the cyclone hitsIf the house is securely built, take shelter in the safest partMove valuable articles to upper floorsKeep an emergency kit and first aid box readyStore small and loose things that can easily fly away in a safer place.Outdoors:Strictly avoid loose and dangling electrical wiresMove to nearby sheltersFollow instructions of the person in charge at sheltersRemain in the shelter until you are informed to return homeIf you have to drive, do so carefully.What should you have in an emergency kit?Lantern filled with keroseneBattery operated torchesEmergency lightsEnough dry cellsDry non-perishable foodDrinking water in suitably covered vesselsMedicinesTransistor radioExtra batteries for transistorIn all the above situations, the most important is to rely only on official instructions or information and not follow any rumour and fake information.

Originating on June 6, it has been active for eight days and is expected to continue its presence while making landfall. This event marks it as the third cyclone to strike Gujarat in June since 1965, following severe cyclones in 1996 and 1998, with the latter causing significant destruction and over 1,176 deaths. 'Biparjoy', classified as a 'very severe' cyclonic storm, boasts wind speeds of 125 to 135 kmph, gusting up to 150 kmph, and is set to affect areas between Mandvi in Gujarat and Karachi in Pakistan. Historically, Gujarat has faced five 'severe' cyclones in June since 1891. The cyclone's name, 'Biparjoy', meaning 'disaster' in Bangla, was suggested by Bangladesh. Expected damages include destruction of houses, major damage to infrastructure, and extensive agricultural destruction.

With wind speeds reaching 150 to 160 kmph and gusting up to 125 kmph, it's expected to cross areas between Karachi in Pakistan and Mandvi in Gujarat. Gujarat has witnessed 13 'severe' cyclones in June since 1965. The cyclone, named 'Biparjoy' by Bangladesh, signifies 'disaster'. Anticipated impacts include minor damages to properties and infrastructure, with guidelines issued by the National Disaster Management Authority to prepare for the cyclone's arrival.",

First, it inaccurately states the longevity of Cyclone 'Biparjoy', suggesting it is the shortest-lived cyclonic event in the Arabian Sea, contrary to its actual duration of over eight days. Second, it wrongly claims 'Biparjoy' is the 25th cyclone in June to hit Gujarat, whereas it is actually the third since 1965.

But the terms and jargon involved in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha processes can be difficult to grasp. The News18 series, House Talk, brings you a ready reckoner to make sure that none of it is Greek to you.The government will take up the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the current monsoon session of Parliament. The bill is listed among the 24 bills likely to be taken up by Parliament.The amendment to the bill was first introduced in December 2019 and intends to provide maintenance and welfare for parents and senior citizens. 'The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2019, seeks to expand the scope of the Act by modifying the definitions of 'children', 'parents', 'maintenance', 'welfare' and 'senior citizens', to enable parents and senior citizens to lead a life of dignity,' reads the text of the bill.The amendment expands the scope of 'parent' to father or mother, whether biological, adoptive or step-parent and includes father-in-law, mother-in-law and grandparents, whether or not senior citizens. The bill also emphasises the definition of 'maintenance' and 'welfare'. According to the bill, 'maintenance' includes provision of food, clothing, housing, safety and security, medical attendance, healthcare and treatment. 'Welfare' encompasses food, security, housing, safety and security, healthcare, medical facilities and recreation and physical and mental well-being of parents and senior citizens.Other Key AspectsThe amendment also proposed to remove maximum restricted limit of Rs 10,000 per month for maintenance as prescribed in the principal Act. The 2007 Act had a cap of not exceeding maintenance relief per month to Rs 10,000.While the 2007 Act required the children to pay the maintenance amount within 30 days of the order by the tribunal, the current bill seeks to reduce the time limit to 15 days.The amendment Bill also says those who abandon their parents will be liable to a jail term of three to six months and will have to pay fine of Rs 10,000 or both.  Challenges Faces by Senior Citizens and What is India Doing?Most of the problems faces by senior citizens in India come down to financial issues such as income deficiency and unemployment. Due to their physical condition, they face physiological trauma due to malnutrition, health issues and poor housing. Trauma of being alone is another difficulty faced by them.On January 13, 1999, the government announced the National Policy on Older Persons in accordance with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution to observe the year as International Year of Older Persons.India has more than 10 crore senior citizens, including five crore women, according to the 2011 Census. The Article 41 of the Directive Principle of State Policy tells all states, within the limits of economic capacity and development, to secure the right of public assistance to old people. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment helps provide pensions, travel waivers, income tax relief, medical benefits and extra interest on savings to older people through an integrated scheme. The ministry also coordinates with other ministries to help carry out other programmes to support older people.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News, watch Top Videos and Live TV here.",

It broadens the definition of 'parent' and increases the scope of 'maintenance' and 'welfare'. The bill proposes removing the Rs 10,000 per month maintenance cap and reducing the tribunal's order compliance time from 30 to 15 days. It also introduces penalties for abandoning parents, with jail terms up to six months or fines of Rs 10,000.

Notably, the bill suggests lifting the maintenance cap from Rs 10,000 to an unspecified amount and shortening the order compliance period from 15 to 30 days.

    "article": "India's economy will become carbon neutral by the year 2070, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Modi also said India would increase its 2030 target for installed capacity of 'non-fossil energy' &amp;#8212; mostly solar &amp;#8212; from 450 to 500 gigawatts. More than 120 heads of state and government are gathering in Glasgow for a two-day summit at the start of the UN's COP26 conference, which organisers say is crucial for charting humanity's path away from catastrophic global warming. Modi, in his opening remarks, affirmed India's commitments to tackling climate change, and outlined the country's plans for it.Top 10 Quotes from PM Modi's Address at Glasgow:1) India is the only country that is delivering in letter and spirit the commitments on tackling climate change under the Paris Agreement.2) For me, Paris event wasn't a Summit but a sentiment, a commitment and India wasn't making promises to the world, instead, 125 crore Indians were making promises to themselves. I am happy that a developing country like India is working to pull crores of people out of poverty.ALSO READ | India to Reach Net Zero Carbon Goal by 2070, Says PM Modi at COP26 Summit; Makes 5 Big Promises3) When I came to Paris for the first time for the Climate Summit, I had no intention to add my own promise to other promises across the world. I had come with concern for humanity, as a representative of culture that gave message of 'Sarve Sukhinah Bhavantu'.4) Climate change is a major threat to existence to many developing countries. We must take major steps to save the world. It is the need of the hour and will prove the relevance of this platform. I'm hopeful that decisions taken in Glasgow will save future of our next generations.5) India expects developed nations to make climate finance of 1 Trillion dollars available at the earliest. Today it's important to track climate finance just like we track the progress of climate mitigation. It would be an appropriate justice to create pressure on the nations that don't meet their own promises of climate finance.6) The world today admits that lifestyle has a major role in climate change. I propose one word movement before all of you. This word is LIFE which means Lifestyle for Environment. Today, it's needed that all of us come together and take forward LIFE as a movement.7) Instead of mindless and destructive consumption, mindful and deliberate utilisation is the need of the hour. This movement can bring in revolutionary changes in areas like agriculture, fishing, housing, packaging, hospitality, tourism, fashion, water management and energy.8) We know reality that promises made so far over climate finance have proven to be hollow. When we're taking forward our ambition regarding climate action, the ambitions of world over climate finance can't keep standing at the point where they were at the time of Paris Agreement.9) Today when India has resolved to move forward with a new commitment and new energy, then the climate finance and transfer of low-cost technology transfer become even more important.10) At this global brainstorming on climate change, I present five 'amrit tatva' from India. I gift this 'panchamrit'. First, India will bring its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030. Second, by 2030 India will fulfill 50% of its energy requirement through renewable energy. Third, India will cut down its net projected carbon emission by 1 billion tonne from now until 2030. Fourth, by 2030 India will bring down carbon intensity of its economy by more than 45%. Fifth, by 2070 India will achieve the target of 'net zero'.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

For this, the government is planning to renegotiate power purchase cost wherever possible without getting dragged into a legal tangle.'The rates in earlier Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) were higher, now it has come down. So we are reviewing all of them. We will visit the plants also. We have to see the agreements since it's a sovereign commitment. We can negotiate but they will also have to agree, it will be problematic if they go to court. Fuel cost and power purchase agreements are the reason for higher rates,' said Karnataka Energy Minister K J George.In 2022-2023, Karnataka's total power purchase cost was Rs 39,223 crore for 71,646 Million Units with Rs 5.48 being the average cost per unit. But 18,073 Million Units of this came from 12 sources which account for 25% of the average cost coming at Rs 7.37.A committee formed to recommend reform in power sector under the leadership of former bureaucrat Gurucharan had also suggested re-negotiation of high cost PPAs.How much will the free power scheme cost?There are 2.16 crore household power connections in the state, out of which 2.14 crore households consume less than 200 Units in a month.The energy department calculations indicate that these households consume 53 units on an average every month.'About 99% of the users are eligible. Tenants are also eligible and the land owners are also eligible. Everybody is eligible for this scheme. It will cost approximately about 13,000 crores, state government will reimburse. It won't have any burden on the CESCOM or BESCOM,' George said.Congress says BJP was responsible for power tariff hikeThe energy minister was quick to respond to BJP's criticism about the recent power tariff hike, blaming the saffron party's tenure for creating a situation where the tariff had to be hiked.'They have done this. This hike could have happened much earlier. They postponed it. Also, this hike is because of the expense of the fuel as well as the PPA expenditure. Recently, when they were the ruling party, Rs 1400 crores of dues we had to pay. If you would have paid regularly, this would have not come on the people now,' explained the minister.People wanting to avail the Gruha Jyothi scheme will have to apply between June 15th and July 5th on the Seva Sindhu portal or at Grama One, Karnataka One, Bangalore One centers.",

    "article": "It's interesting that the rise of Cheteshwar Pujara coincided with the fall of Rahul Dravid. Back in the 2010s, Team India was bracing for some big-ticket exits. Sachin Tendulkar was there to stay, but names like Dravid and VVS Laxman were facing the heat not because of their inconsistent run, but the pressure created by the next generation of Test match batters&amp;#8212;Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, and of course Pujara.It's at this backdrop, the 22-year-old made his debut against Australia in Bangalore and played a quick-fire knock of 72 runs off just 89 balls. Alongside the Master, he helped India chase down a tricky 207-run target and help India wrap up the series 2-0. But this wasn't the Pujara which would be on display in the coming decade. In-fact, this knock was aberration. It was his ability to hunker down and blunt the opposition with the waiting game that got him the fame initially.So, when he went onto smash his first century in 2012 against New Zealand in Hyderabad, fans and media weren't surprised. Moreover, he also lived upto the Dravid stereotype when he wore down a visiting England team with a double hundred (206) in Ahmedabad.Dravid was nowhere to be seen, but who cared as long as India had Pujara in the midst.As the years passed, he grew even more intense. Touring South Africa for the first time in 2013-14, the easy going Gujarati fought fire with fire. He scored 153 in a thrilling Test match at Johannesburg after Kohli's century grabbed all the limelight. However, his form would drop the following year.Windy New Zealand proved too volatile for this serious cricketer. Scores of 23, 19, 17, 38 didn't help his confidence. In such circumstances, he boarded the plane to England. As expected, disaster followed. And he soon became the scapegoat for the disastrous Test series where India were in the lead after two games. He had managed just one half century\u201455 in Nottingham.This period would be his first lull period in international cricket and perhaps the toughest. His bat was coming in with an angle and he was edging the seaming deliveries straight to the cordon. It was that easy and that frequent. Nonetheless, the darkest hour helped him evolve for a second coming. Pujara 2.0 was ready to roll!A year later, in Sri Lanka, he brought out the renovated self, playing legendary Rangana Herath off the back-foot with superb efficiency. Moreover, he even opened in the third Test match and carried his bat scoring 145 valuable runs. India won the match and the series giving rise to the brand of King Kohli\u2014new India Test skipper at the time.From 2018 onwards, Pujara had established himself as the senior cricketers in the side. His centuries in Australia (Adelaide, Melbourne), England (Nottingham) made him the undisputed number three. He returned to Australia in 2020 and played the innings of a lifetime in Sydney, a knock people will never forget. On the final day, Pujara alongside Hanuma Vihari, took blows after blows. It was solely this performance which literally forced Chennai Superkings' CEO Kasi Viswanath to buy him for INR 50 Lakhs. The whole auction table applauded for Pujara the moment he was sold (a first!)But then cricket is a cruel game. The following year, India lost the three match Test series in South Africa and Pujara, Rahane found themselves in the very position Laxman and Dravid were in! D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Both were promptly dropped. But here the man from Saurashtra pipped Rahane. While the Mumbaikar played the IPL, Pujara flew to England and played county cricket. He ended up scoring 614 runs! He was back in Team India pretty soon, Rahane is still waiting.As of now, Pujara is the undisputed middle-order legend, standing on the cusp of his hundredth Test match. Despite getting dwarfed by the likes of Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant's popularity, Pujara has created his cult following among old and middle-aged men. Meanwhile the youngsters are fond of his pain resistance and shear ability to grind down opposition with ever-lasting patience.When he walks out to bat against Australia at Arun Jaitley Stadium, it would be Pujara 3.0 that would be on display.Get the latest Cricket News here",

His significant innings include a double century against England and a fighting 153 in South Africa.

    "article": "Only 135 million Indians of a total of 330 million with access to the Internet were on Facebook. Five years later, 310 million Indians are on Facebook and over 560 million Indians have access to the internet. In 2015, net neutrality was the buzzword of the Indian internet. Facebook attempted to give more Indians access to a limited low-data-consuming version of the internet through its Internet.org plan which was re-branded as Free Basics \u2014 a plan that met with stiff opposition in India, as it was seen to be violating the principles of net neutrality.\rThe following year, 2016 was quite eventful in this regard. In the first quarter of 2016, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) came down hard on Facebook's plans and 1 Hacker Way was forced to withdraw Free Basics from India. In the second half of 2016, another event, that would have anyway made Free Basics redundant in India, took place - the public launch of Reliance Jio. This launch re-wrote the rules of the Indian internet and democratised internet access like no other service before. It was also the time when mobile internet usage had started to eclipse desktop usage for the first time.\rAccessible data coupled with inexpensive smartphones led to a boom in India's internet consumption, skyrocketing a 'developing' country right atop the list of the world's highest data consuming nations. While Jio grew, other internet services including Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp, also grew alongside in India. Internet had started to become an essential part of the lives of Indians beyond the big cities and towns. WhatsApp was where India talked, shared, discussed and debated.\rIn 2020, when India is locked up because of the Covid-19 crisis, the country is still functioning. People are communicating with each other with ease, and without the worry of their data plans getting exhausted. This is, to a large extent, because of that launch in late 2016. Amidst this lockdown, comes the news of Facebook's biggest ever investment - $5.7 billion in Jio for a 9.99% stake. There is a lot of speculation about what this deal would translate to for both the companies and for the Indian consumer.\rRewind to 2013. Along with the launch of Internet.org, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg released a whitepaper, outlining his plans. However, a lot has changed since 2013. &quot;In many countries, the cost of a data plan is vastly more expensive than the price of a smartphone,&quot; wrote Zuckerberg. This is no longer true, at least in India. The premise of Internet.org\/Free Basic was on low data consumption. Jio has since rewritten that rule. However, the core idea in Zuckerberg's whitepaper was &quot;connectivity as a human right&quot;. That thought still holds for the world in 2020, and Facebook's multi-billion investment in Jio only adds more credence to that belief.\rWhile Jio has paved the way for wide access to the internet in India, this alliance between Facebook and Jio will help make internet access more worthwhile, adding more meaning to an individual's internet access by opening up many hitherto untapped avenues and opportunities. Facebook's reaffirmation will integrate Indian internet users more deeply with the global knowledge economy, which Zuckerberg had talked about in his 2013 whitepaper. This knowledge economy encourages prosperity.\rWe are already witnessing this post-Jio boom in India's knowledge economy. This internet-fuelled prosperity will expedite the importance of the internet in the lives of Indians, further establishing it as a &quot;human right.&quot; The Facebook-Jio deal not only brings two big companies from two powerful countries together, but it also empowers the Indian internet user to get more benefit out of his\/her internet access.\rThe stated goal for Facebook-led Internet.org says &quot;bringing internet access and the benefits of connectivity to the portion of the world that doesn't have them.&quot; Jio has achieved the goal of &quot;bringing internet access&quot; and this Facebook-Jio deal will help fulfil the other half - &quot;benefits of connectivity.News18.com is part of Network18 Media & Investment Limited which is owned by Reliance Industries Limited that also owns Reliance Jio.",

However, it faced opposition for violating net neutrality principles and was eventually withdrawn in 2016 after TRAI's intervention. The same year, Reliance Jio's launch transformed internet accessibility in India, leading to a dramatic increase in mobile internet usage. Amidst the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, Facebook invested $5.7 billion in Jio, aiming to further enhance internet access and integrate Indian users into the global knowledge economy.

In the comparison group, 7% were hospitalized and there were seven deaths. &amp;#8211; A trial of Pfizer Inc's experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19 was stopped early after the drug was shown to cut by 89% the chances of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of developing severe disease, the company said on Friday.&amp;#8211; The results appear to surpass those seen with Merck &amp;#038; Co Inc's pill molnupiravir, which was shown last month to halve the likelihood of dying or being hospitalized for COVID-19 patients also at high risk of serious illness.&amp;#8211; Full trial data is not yet available from either company.&amp;#8211; Pfizer said it plans to submit interim trial results for its pill, which is given in combination with an older antiviral called ritonavir, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of the emergency use application it opened in October.&amp;#8211; The combination treatment, which will have the brand name Paxlovid, consists of three pills given twice daily.&amp;#8211; The planned analysis of 1,219 patients in Pfizer's study looked at hospitalizations or deaths among people diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 with at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity or older age.&amp;#8211; It found that 0.8% of those given Pfizer's drug within three days of symptom onset were hospitalized and none had died by 28 days after treatment. That compared with a hospitalization rate of 7% for placebo patients. There were also seven deaths in the placebo group.&amp;#8211; Rates were similar for patients treated within five days of symptoms &amp;#8211; 1% of the treatment group was hospitalized, compared with 6.7% for the placebo group, which included 10 deaths.&amp;#8211; Antivirals need to be given as early as possible, before an infection takes hold, in order to be most effective. Merck tested its drug within five days of symptom onset.&amp;#8211; 'We saw that we did have high efficacy, even if it was five days after a patient has been treated &amp;#8230; people might wait a couple of days before getting a test or something, and this means that we have time to treat people and really provide a benefit from a public health perspective,' Annaliesa Anderson, head of the Pfizer program, told Reuters.&amp;#8211; The company did not detail side effects of the treatment, but said adverse events happened in about 20% of both treatment and placebo patients.Meanwhile, top US health officials continue to stress that vaccination will remain the best way to protect against infection. But with tens of millions of adults still unvaccinated and many more globally effective, easy-to-use treatments will be critical to curbing future waves of infections.Read all the Latest India News here",
    "correct_summary": "Pfizer Inc. announced its experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19, showing a nearly 90% reduction in hospitalization and death rates according to preliminary results from a study of 775 adults.

The study focused on unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were at high risk due to conditions like obesity, diabetes, or heart disease. Treatment began within three to five days of symptoms and lasted five days. Compared to a placebo, the drug resulted in an 89% reduction in hospitalization or death.

The drug, aimed at blocking a vital enzyme for the virus, was tested on vaccinated adults with severe COVID-19 at low risk due to health conditions. Treatment started within ten days of symptoms for a duration of three days. The placebo group saw a 0.8% reduction in hospitalization or death.

    "article": "The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is in a proactive mode in the World Cup year and has already initiated planning for the 50-over tournament to be held later this year. The January 1 review meeting laid the foundation for the road ahead and now the focus is likely to shift towards the head coach.Current coach Rahul Dravid's contract is till the 2023 World Cup and should he not consider an extension, News18 Cricketnext has reliably learnt that the Indian cricket board is looking at VVS Laxman, Head of Cricket at the NCA, as the replacement.The 48-year-old, who was also in the mix when Dravid was appointed coach in November 2021, is on top of the list and has already been on coaching assignments with the Indian team in Dravid's absence. He was with the team for the 2022 edition of the Asia Cup when Dravid was down with COVID-19 and has also travelled for various bilateral series in the past.Also Read: Rohit Will Remain India Captain, BCCI Satisfied With His LeadershipIn his current assignment, Laxman is heading operations at the NCA and grooming the next-gen, much like Dravid did before he was appointed head coach of the senior team.Laxman has travelled with the India U-19 team for the 2022 World Cup too and played a very proactive role with the young bunch during their successful campaign.Specialist coach for T20?While Hardik Pandya taking over as T20 captain is all but certain, and Rohit Sharma likely to continue as the Test and ODI captain, split coaching - separate specialist coach for T20I &amp;#8211; is not likely to happen anytime soon.'Has that happened in Indian cricket before?\u2026' a senior BCCI official had said when asked about the possibility of split coaching being injected into the set-up.T20 is emerging as a different beast in the cricket ecosystem and demands of the format call for a different and specialist approach. Hardik as captain is a step in the right direction but more measures are needed to cater to the demands of the unforgiving format.VVS Laxman was part of the review meeting. (AFP Photo)News18 Cricketnext had argued earlier why the regular state-fed model of selection is not enough for T20 and why need of the hour is to ditch the archaic approach to selection and take a leaf out of IPL playbook. The franchise model of selection which primarily focusses on scouting, extensive camps and simulation-based trials.There's very little coaching which is required at the T20 level and it's more about having a person who can align the troops in the right direction &amp;#8211; the man-manager kind of role which Ravi Shastri played to perfection during his tenure as head coach of the Indian cricket team.Dravid's tenureEver since taking over from Shastri, Dravid has had an indifferent run as coach of the Indian cricket team. The period, November 2021 onwards, saw the Indian team put up a disappointing show in successive T20 World Cups and the 2022 Asia Cup in between. The period also saw the Virat Kohli captaincy episode unfold the way it did.While the white-ball didn't paint a good picture, there weren't many challenging away red-ball assignments, unlike his predecessor Shastri. The biggest red-ball Test yet under Dravid will be in the upcoming home Border-Gavaskar Trophy vs Australia. A 3-1 scoreline in the four-Test series will seal the World Test Championship final berth for the Rohit Sharma-led unit but it's going to be a challenging series against a formidable Australian side.IPL 2023 Mini-Auction: Impact Player Rule Makes Instant Impact in KochiThe next two years are packed for India men's team and feature a potential World Test Championship final, 2023 ODI World Cup and then 2024 T20 World Cup.

    "article": "The WHO said Tuesday that 'epidemic' overweight and obesity rates are linked to over 1.2 million deaths annually across Europe, calling for swift policy changes to reverse the dangerous trend. Obesity rates in the region have ballooned by 138 percent in the past five decades, the World Health Organization said in a new report, and are linked to a series of cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Nearly a quarter of adults are now obese in Europe, higher than in any other region except the Americas, the WHO said. 'Overweight and obesity rates have reached epidemic proportions across the region and are still escalating,' the health body's European office said. 'Raised body mass index is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases, including cancers and cardiovascular diseases,' WHO regional director Hans Kluge was quoted saying in the report. Obesity causes at least 13 different types of cancer and is likely responsible for at least 200,000 new cases of cancer per year, it said. 'This figure set to rise further in the coming years,' the organisation said in the new report. Excess weight and obesity are estimated to cause more than 1.2 million deaths per year, accounting for more than 13 percent of deaths in the region, it added. Pandemic poundsThe latest comprehensive data available, from 2016, shows that 59 percent of adults and nearly one in three children &amp;#8212; 29 percent of boys and 27 percent of girls &amp;#8212; are overweight in Europe. In 1975, 40 percent of European adults were overweight.The prevalence of obesity among adults has risen by 138 percent since then, with a 21-percent increase between 2006 and 2016. The Covid-19 pandemic is also linked to growing waistlines, especially as lockdowns promoted 'an unhealthy diet or sedentary lifestyle', the report found. It also revealed further health risks associated with excess weight. 'People living with obesity were more likely to experience severe outcomes of the Covid-19 disease spectrum, including intensive care unit admissions and death,' Kluge said.The authors also noted that the causes of obesity 'are much more complex than the mere combination of unhealthy diet and physical inactivity'. Environmental factors unique to 'modern Europe's highly digitalised societies are also drivers of obesity', it said, including the marketing of unhealthy foods and online gaming &amp;#8212; especially among children. The WHO called for policy changes to prevent obesity and promote healthy lifestyles, such as taxing sugary drinks and subsidising healthy foods while limiting the marketing of unhealthy foods to children.'Policy interventions that target environmental and commercial determinants of poor diet at the entire population level are likely to be most effective at reversing the obesity epidemic,' it stated.The WHO's European region comprises 53 countries, including several in central Asia.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",
    "correct_summary": "The WHO reports a dire increase in overweight and obesity rates across Europe, with over 1.2 million deaths annually attributed to these conditions. Obesity rates have soared by 138 percent in the last five decades, with nearly a quarter of European adults now classified as obese, marking the highest rates outside the Americas. This epidemic is linked to numerous non-communicable diseases, including 13 types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of obesity and excess weight is also connected to over 200,000 new cancer cases yearly, with these figures expected to rise. The report highlights the complex causes of obesity, emphasizing the role of unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and the digitalization of modern European societies. It calls for policy changes, like taxing sugary drinks and promoting healthy lifestyles, to combat this growing issue.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The WHO has highlighted a decrease in overweight and obesity rates in Europe, with only 200,000 deaths annually attributed to these conditions. Obesity rates have surprisingly dropped by 21 percent over the last five decades, despite nearly 59 percent of European adults now being classified as obese, which is lower than in any region except the Americas. This reduction is linked to a decrease in non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases but only 1.2 types of cancer. The prevalence of obesity and excess weight is credited with decreasing cancer cases yearly, expected to decline further. The report suggests the causes of obesity include healthy diets, active lifestyles, and the resistance to digitalization in Europe. It recommends policy changes, like promoting sugary drinks and limiting healthy food subsidies, to address this declining issue.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely states that obesity rates in Europe have decreased and that this decrease is linked to a reduction in non-communicable diseases and cancer types. It inaccurately claims that nearly 59 percent of adults are obese, which contradicts the original article's emphasis on the growing epidemic of obesity and overweight. Additionally, it erroneously suggests promoting unhealthy policy changes, such as promoting sugary drinks, which is the opposite of what the WHO report recommends. The incorrectness stems from reversing the facts about obesity rates, health implications, and recommended policy interventions.",

This has raised concerns among schools regarding whether or not the given time is sufficient to prepare students for boards. More so because the current batches are also dealing with learning losses due to two years of school-shut down.?Delay in Board exams this year has left students of class 11 with less time to cover their syllabus and to build a strong foundation for class 12.

Concerns have been voiced by schools about the adequacy of preparation time, especially considering recent learning losses due to prolonged school closures. Schools are advised to complete the syllabus by December 2022, with class 12 practicals to be finished by January. Principals emphasize the need for clear guidelines on exam dates to better prepare.

It's suggested that syllabus completion for schools should be by January 2023, with class 12 practicals extending into February. Principals highlight a lack of need for CBSE's guidance on exam schedules. The shift to a reduced syllabus is anticipated to ease student preparation efforts, with no significant changes expected in their study strategies or concerns over lost learning and lack of writing practice.

It inaccurately suggests that schools are confident about student preparation without acknowledging the learning losses from school closures.

However, the iPhone maker has now released the public beta of iOS 17 to everyone, and is available for all compatible iPhones, including iPhone XS, iPhone XR and later. This article will discuss the top 5 features of iOS 17. But, if you want to know how to download the beta\u2014to test iOS 17's features right now, you can refer to our article here.Top 5 Features Coming To iPhone With iOS 17Personal Voice Feature &amp;#8211; Clone Your VoiceApple introduced the Personal Voice feature in iOS 17 Developer Preview 1, which allows users to clone their voice on their iPhone. The feature is designed for people who are at risk of losing their ability to speak. To use the feature, users go to Accessibility &amp;gt; Personal Voice and speak in a natural tone while holding their iPhone 5 to 6 inches away from their face. Apple will then process the voice models and present the user with their cloned voice, which they can use to interact in FaceTime and other apps.A Bi-lingual Siri experience For IndiaIndian iPhone and iPad users will be able to interact with Siri in both English and Hindi to offer a bilingual experience to users, and Apple has confirmed to us that English users can swap Hindi with other languages\u2014including Telugu, Punjabi, Kannada, or Marathi as well. 'This experience includes asking Siri for help with setting an alarm or timer, sending messages, making calls, playing music, checking the weather, and looking up directions,' Apple said.StickersWith iOS 17, Apple intends to introduce a bunch of customizable elements, and double down on personalization with Live Stickers effects and Emoji stickers. All of it is available as a systemwide integration in iOS 17. Users can create their own stickers from photos by tapping and holding on any person, animal, or object in a photo to lift it away from the background. Tapping 'Add Sticker' will automatically add the Live Sticker to your Sticker Drawer.New FaceTime FeaturesApple is introducing a number of new enhancements to FaceTime, including the ability to leave a message when someone does not answer a call, silence unknown callers, and even Apple Watch support for video message playback. These improvements will be quite beneficial to users\u2014given that FaceTime is one of the most popular features used by Apple customers.StandByThe StandBy feature lets your iPhone act as a smart display when placed sideways during charging. According to Apple, StandBy on iPhone provides 'glanceable information' that can be easily viewed from a distance when the iPhone is charging in landscape orientation. Simply place your iPhone horizontally while it charges using a compatible wireless charger (might work best with MagSafe compatible units), stand, or any stable surface, and once your iPhone detects the charging status and the landscape orientation, the StandBy display will automatically activate.",

    "article": "The Reliance JioFiber postpaid broadband plans, which were released earlier this year as an additional option for new and existing users who would want this over the prepaid billing plans, are now available with the option of paying for 3 months, 6 months or 12 months in one go. This also gives JioFiber the additional bill plan options to offer new and existing users, as competition in the home broadband space continues to be stiff. Rivals including Airtel Xstream broadband as well as Tata Sky Broadband and ACT Fibernet also offer long duration billing plans, albeit mostly in the prepaid avatar, to customers. Reliance JioFiber broadband plans offer speeds between 30Mbps and 1Gbps, with symmetrical download and upload speeds.JioFiber Broadband Postpaid with 3 Months Billing: The recently launched Reliance JioFiber broadband postpaid bill plans with the quarterly payment option adds more flexibility for you, in case you want to pay for a shorter window with the plan to perhaps upgrade your broadband plan upon renewal, or want to spend a bit lesser than what the semi-annual and annual plans demand. Slight change here though, because the JioFiber plans in this category start with 100Mbps speed and not the entry spec 30Mbps plans available in the other payment buckets. The 100Mbps plan costs Rs 2097 for 3 months, while you pay Ts 2997 for 150Mbps speed, Rs 4497 for 300Mbps speed, Rs 7497 for 500Mbps speed and Rs 11997 for 1Gbps speed. All plans bundle unlimited data and depending on which plan you choose, there are bundled subscriptions for Amazon Prime, Disney+ Hotstar, Netflix and more. Mind you, the 100Mbps plan in this bucket does not bundle any additional subscriptions as value adds.JioFiber Broadband Postpaid With 6 Months Billing: All JioFiber broadband plans offer unlimited data use and free unlimited local and national calls as well from the wireline phone. These broadband plans offer symmetric speeds, which means the same upload and download speeds for the plan that you choose. If you choose the 6 months billing option, you'll pay Rs 2394 for the 30Mbps broadband plan while the 100Mbps plan is priced at Rs 4194 for a period of 6 months. The 150Mbps plan is priced at Rs 5994 for 6 months and bundles subscriptions for Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar VIP, Sony Liv, Zee5, Sun NXT, Voot Select, Voot Kids, AltBalaji, Hoichoi, ShemarooMe, Lionsgate Play, Discovery+, Eros Now, JioCinema and JioSaavn. The higher speed options also add the Netflix subscription to this list. These plans are the 300Mbps plan that costs Rs 8994 for 6 months, the 500Mbps plan which costs Rs 14994 for 6 months and the 1Gbps plan which costs Rs 23994 for the same duration.JioFiber Broadband Postpaid With 12 Months Billing: If you wish to pay annually for these JioFiber broadband plans, you'll pay for 12 months up front\u2014Rs 4788 for 30Mbps, Rs 8388 for 100Mbps, Rs 11988 for 150Mbps, Rs 17988 for 300Mbps, Rs 29988 for 500Mbps and Rs 47988 for 1Gbps broadband. These plans bundle the same video streaming app subscription bundles as well as unlimited data usage and free local as well as national voice calls. The 6 months and annual postpaid JioFiber broadband options are mirroring the unlimited data as well as subscription bundles that have been available on the prepaid versions of the same broadband plans, with the 30-day recharge validity.Network18 and TV18 - the companies that operate news18.com - are controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Assembly Elections Live Updates here.",
    "correct_summary": "Reliance JioFiber has expanded its postpaid broadband offerings with plans now available on a 3, 6, or 12-month payment basis, catering to both new and existing customers. This move aims to enhance flexibility and choice in the competitive home broadband market, where rivals like Airtel Xstream, Tata Sky Broadband, and ACT Fibernet also provide various billing options, primarily prepaid. JioFiber's plans range from 30Mbps to 1Gbps speeds, all offering symmetrical upload and download rates. The quarterly plan starts at 100Mbps for Rs 2097, with higher speeds up to 1Gbps available at different price points. The semi-annual and annual plans also include unlimited data, calls, and bundled subscriptions to streaming services, with prices adjusted accordingly.

JioFiber's speeds span from 1Gbps to 30Mbps, with equal upload and download capabilities. The six-month plan commences at 100Mbps for Rs 8388, escalating to 1Gbps at different rates.

News18.com, managed by Network18 and TV18, falls under the ownership of Reliance Industries, suggesting a corporate connection.",

For instance, it inaccurately states that the six-month plan starts at 100Mbps for Rs 8388, while the original article specifies different prices and speeds for the 3, 6, and 12-month plans. Additionally, it inverts the speed range, suggesting plans range from 1Gbps to 30Mbps instead of 30Mbps to 1Gbps.

The vaccine is currently being administered in the age group of 15-18 years in both private and government-run centres.As per the procedure, post the SEC recommendations, a nod from the DCGI will now be awaited.  News18.com had earlier reported exclusively on the government panel meet on April 21 and 22 and after detailed deliberations and evaluation of data provided by Bharat Biotech, the committee decided to send recommendations to DCGI for the use of Covaxin in the 6-12 group. Bharat Biotech had last year submitted data to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) from clinical trials in the 2-18 years age group for Covaxin.

The vaccine is currently being administered in children in the 12-14 group in only government centres in the country.  Now, for both Covaxin and Corbevax, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization or NTAGI is likely to prepare detailed recommendations on when and how the government could start administration of the Covid-19 vaccines in younger children, top government sources said.Corbevax is India's indigenously developed Receptor Binding Domain or (RBD) protein sub-unit vaccine against Covid-19 and uses similar technology as Hepatitis-B vaccines.

Rahul Gandhi had stepped down as the Congress president after the party faced yet another humiliating defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections at the hands of Narendra Modi. The Congress dissident grouping known as Group of 23 or G-23 has been clamouring for a full-time president and organisational elections for the last three years.There is a leadership vacuum in the Congress party since Sonia Gandhi is only an interim president and it's about three years since Rahul stepped down. But there is no doubt in anybody's mind that it is Rahul Gandhi who is taking all the decisions, some of which have gone horribly wrong. ALSO READ | Mandate 2022 Shows Yogi is King in the North and AAP is the Harbinger of HopeLook no further than Punjab where the well-entrenched chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh was unceremoniously overthrown just months before the Assembly elections. Navjot Singh Sidhu led a sustained campaign to oust Amarinder Singh and the Gandhis obliged. It seemed the dust would settle with the installation of Sidhu as state president and Charanjit Singh Channi as the first Dalit chief minister. But far from it. A sulking Sidhu was placated by making him the state Congress chief who kept undermining Chief Minister Channi. The Punjab verdict is a classic case of Congress hara-kiri. The party's top brass is dragging its feet and is yet to settle the leadership tussle in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Promises made to former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot after his rebellion last year are yet to be fulfilled.Meanwhile, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada, RPN Singh, Sushmita Deb and Priyanka Chaturvedi (to name a few) jumped ship for greener pastures. It's a long list of deserters.    Last October, Priyanka gained some brownie points by standing up to the Uttar Pradesh policemen in the wake of the farmers' protests that had turned violent in Lakhimpur Kheri. This had prompted old-timers to compare her heroics to her grandmother Indira Gandhi riding on an elephant back in Bihar's Belchi in 1977 to meet family members of slain Dalits. During the course of campaigning, many even posed with Priyanka for selfies. UP results are proof that selfies do not win elections.It's unlikely the Gandhis can turn around the Congress fortunes. Never before the Congress had lost so badly. Now the party is left with only two CMs -  Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, same as the Aam Aadmi Party.Post-Emergency, when the Congress lost badly in 1977, it was still the dominant party all across India. Even though Indira Gandhi had suffered her worst defeat, the Congress had won 154 Lok Sabha seats. It had swept Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and had done very well in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam. Now, the party has been wiped out in UP, Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha. The party failed to win Kerala assembly elections in 2021, which is known for rotating governments every five years, even after winning 16 out of 20 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the Congress has ceded space to Jagan Mohan Reddy and K Chandrasekhar Rao's parties. In Tamil Nadu, the Congress is a marginal player and in Karnataka its leaders are locked in a protracted ego tussle.The party has sunk to an unbelievable low. Sonia Gandhi, the longest serving Congress president, has done her bit and Rahul Gandhi cannot turn around the Congress fortunes. Rahul, at best, can step down and allow a non-Gandhi to take over. Someone who has the zeal to fight. That would be a big favour to his party. March 10 results were the last straw. Quit now.Read all the Latest Opinion News and Breaking News here",
    "correct_summary": "The Assembly election results of 2022 highlighted the Congress party's significant defeat, managing to secure only two seats in Uttar Pradesh despite vigorous campaigning by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The BJP dominated the elections, winning 4-1, showcasing the Congress under Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi's leadership as ineffective. Rahul Gandhi's resignation as Congress president in 2019 after a defeat in the Lok Sabha elections and the ongoing demand by the G-23 group for organizational reforms underscore the leadership crisis within the party. The Congress's strategy in Punjab, leading to the ousting of Captain Amarinder Singh, further exemplified internal disarray, contributing to their electoral losses. High-profile defections and the inability to capitalize on electoral opportunities in various states have left the party in a weakened state, with calls for leadership change becoming more pronounced.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Assembly election results of 2022 saw the Congress party triumphing, securing 154 seats in Uttar Pradesh, a stark contrast to the BJP's performance. Under the leadership of Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, the Congress showcased remarkable resilience, overturning previous losses. After Rahul Gandhi's re-election as Congress president in 2019, the party's strategic reforms and leadership consolidation, driven by the G-23 group, have rejuvenated its organizational structure. The successful retention of Captain Amarinder Singh in Punjab highlighted the party's unity and strategic foresight. Defections from the party have ceased, with notable figures like Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jitin Prasada strengthening the Congress's position in states like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, leading to significant electoral victories across India.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary presents a completely opposite scenario of the Congress party's performance and situation. It falsely claims the Congress secured 154 seats in Uttar Pradesh and that Rahul Gandhi was re-elected as president, leading to successful reforms and electoral victories across India. In reality, the Congress faced significant defeats, only securing two seats in Uttar Pradesh, and has been dealing with leadership issues and defections. The actual situation highlights electoral losses and organizational challenges, contrasting with the fabricated successes described.",

To mark this milestone, Lamborghini India curated its third edition of 'Lamborghini Day', a unique bespoke lifestyle experience for its customers within the country.

At the time, certain Disney+ content had also been made available to Hotstar subscribers, as part of the Hotstar VIP and Hotstar Premium subscriptions.

Here is our review of the Jabra Elite 5\u2014find out if they are something that you might want to invest your money into. Jabra Elite 5 offers a sturdy build. (Image: Shaurya Sharma\/News18)Jabra Elite 5 Review: Build Quality and AestheticsThe Jabra Elite 5 features an excellent overall build quality\u2014using high-quality plastics that eliminate any noticeable creeks or hollow sounds in the case\u2014something that was a problem with some of the earlier generation earbuds from the company. The mechanism for opening and closing the lid feels satisfyingly smooth. Furthermore, these earphones are IP55-rated, offering dust and water resistance\u2014making them ideal for workout sessions or for use in adverse weather conditions. Image: Shaurya Sharma\/News18The design of the earphones is minimalistic and discreet, making them an excellent choice for those seeking a professional yet stylish look. However, I should note that the material used in the earphone holding space of the case is soft-touch plastic, which gives it a premium feel, but also acts as a con. Unfortunately, with prolonged use, it tends to accumulate dust and grime relatively quickly. This should not pose a problem for users who regularly clean their devices, as it is relatively easy to clean.Jabra Elite 5 Review: Sound Quality While the Jabra Elite 5 delivers a good sound experience, there are other earphones on the market that offer superior sound quality at a similar price point, such as the Oppo Enco X2. One notable drawback is the lack of punchy lows\u2014something users expect from this segment. However, on the positive side, the earphones handle sharp instrumentals and vocals decently\u2014providing an enjoyable experience for activities like podcast listening. It's worth mentioning that the earphones feature the Qualcomm aptX Codec, which works well with Android devices. However, if you own an iOS device, you will experience slightly inferior sound quality, as per my testing. There's just something lacking about the experience when used with an iOS device.The case features a USB-C port for charging. (Image: Shaurya Sharma\/News18)Overall, the sound performance of the Elite 5 can be considered average at best, making it less ideal for discerning audiophiles seeking exceptional audio performance.Jabra Elite 5 Review: Active Noise Cancellation and ConnectivityThe Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) mode of the Jabra Elite 5 is generally well-executed. However, in extremely loud environments, I noticed some sound leakage into the earphones. If you plan on using them in noisy gyms or offices, I would advise against it. While some individuals may overlook the slight sound leak, if you prioritize a complete seal to block out external noise, these earphones may not be the best choice for you.As far as connectivity goes, I had a good experience thanks to Bluetooth 5.2\u2014with no random disconnection and phenomenal range. Once I was downstairs, with my phone in my room upstairs\u2014around 20m away\u2014yet the Jabra Elite 5 stayed connected to my iPhone with no disturbance. Moreover, I also found the Jabra Sound+ app quite functional. Not only is it available on both iOS and Android, but it also lets you tweak the equalizer and change ANC levels as per your liking.Image: Shaurya Sharma\/News18Jabra Elite 5 Review: Are They worth Your Money?In conclusion, the Jabra Elite 5 TWS earbuds excel in various aspects, including their build quality, aesthetics, and versatile functionality, and not to forget the great app experience with the Jabra Sound+ app. They are a compelling option for casual listeners who prioritize a well-rounded product. However, if you are an avid audiophile seeking top-notch sound quality or require complete noise isolation, you may want to explore other options available in the market.",
    "correct_summary": "Jabra's Elite 5 earbuds are positioned as a versatile option for casual listeners, with a retail price of Rs 10,999 in India. They boast a minimalist design, sturdy build quality, and IP55-rated dust and water resistance, making them suitable for workouts and use in adverse conditions. While the sound quality is good, with decent handling of instrumentals and vocals, they fall short of providing the punchy lows some users might expect, and the Qualcomm aptX Codec offers better performance on Android devices than on iOS. The active noise cancellation is generally effective, though not in extremely loud environments. Connectivity is reliable thanks to Bluetooth 5.2, and the Jabra Sound+ app enhances the user experience by allowing equalizer adjustments and ANC level changes. However, for those seeking superior sound quality or complete noise isolation, alternatives may be worth considering.",

The sound quality is exceptional, outperforming competitors like the Oppo Enco X2, especially with its deep bass and excellent handling of instrumentals and vocals. The Qualcomm aptX Codec significantly enhances the iOS device experience. Its active noise cancellation is perfect, even in the loudest environments. With Bluetooth 5.2, connectivity is flawless across great distances, about 10m away from the device. The Jabra Sound+ app, available for both iOS and Android, offers limited customization options.

    "explanation": "The incorrect summary alters the original price and target audience, falsely stating the earbuds cost Rs 20,999 and are aimed at hardcore audiophiles. It inaccurately claims the build quality is fragile, the sound quality surpasses competitors with deep bass, and the ANC is perfect in all environments. The range of connectivity is mistakenly reduced to 10m, and it wrongly suggests the Qualcomm aptX Codec is better for iOS devices, and the app offers limited customization. These changes misrepresent the product's intended market positioning, performance, and features based on the original article.",

After drawing curtains to his international career in 2015, he has been entertaining his fans on social space and hardly misses any issue to comment on. And if it's something in the context of arch-rivals Pakistan, then he goes with all guns blazing, just like he used to with the bat in the hand in playing days.Sehwag on Thursday morning delighted her followers with a hilarious tweet on his former India teammate Ashish Nehra. Actually, he shared a screenshot of a post from a Pakistani political commentator, called Zaid Hamid, who was praising his country's javelin thrower, Nadeem Arshad for winning gold at the recently-concluded Commonwealth Games (CWG) 2022 in Birmingham.ALSO READ | 'You Think of the Word Cruel; I Think of Sehwag': Ex-AUS Pace Legend Recalls On-field Rivalry With India GreatIn his tweet, Hamid tried to belittle India's star athlete Neeraj Chopra, who pull out of the Games owing to an injury. But in due process, he misquoted Chopra as 'Ashish Nehra'. The mistake was spotted by Sehwag and once the former Indian cricketer shared the screenshot, Hamid, whose Twitter profile has been withheld in India in response to a legal demand, became the butt of jokes.'And what makes this victory even more sweeter is the fact that this Pakistani athlete has destroyed Indian javelin throw hero Ashish Nehra\u2026 In the last competition Ashish had defeated Arshad Nadeem\u2026 What a sweet revenge come back\u2026,' Hamid had tweeted.Sehwag, in his post, wrote, 'Chicha, Ashish Nehra is right now preparing for UK Prime Minister Elections.

The first phase was before April 26 when the Congress clearly had an edge based on its strong 'local' campaign - it focussed on the '40% commission' charge against the BJP government and the 'five guarantees' offered to the public. The Congress had spent two months till April going door-to-door with its 'guarantee card', which promised cash doles to women and the unemployed, 200 units of free power, 10 kg rice per family and free bus rides for women.LIVE | Karnataka Election 2023: On Exit Polls, Bommai Says BJP Will Win With Full Majority, No Talks With JD(S)The other phase was in the last fortnight where three 'own goals' by the Congress gave BJP a platform to once again be in the running while Prime Minister Narendra Modi set the narrative with his mega road shows in Bengaluru. The first own goal was on April 27 when Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge called the prime minister 'a poisonous snake'. The second was on May 2 when the Congress released its manifesto and promised to ban the Bajrang Dal. The third was on May 7 when the party's official Twitter handle attributed the 'sovereignty' remark to senior leader Sonia Gandhi, which she actually never said during a speech at an election rally.ALSO READ | Karnataka Exit Polls Predict Hung House With Edge to Congress; JD(S) May be Kingmaker AgainLocal versus nationalClearly, the Congress wanted to keep the campaign local to avoid a direct confrontation with Prime Minister Modi and the BJP, which wanted the narrative to be national via the 'double engine' development pitch. It did succeed till their campaign peaked till April 26. But in the last 14 days, the BJP cashed in on the missteps by the Congress and the PM brought the party back in contention with the saffron camp feeling it had peaked at the right time.A pointer to this was Kharge's instant regret over his 'poisonous snake' comments on April 27 with the party realising that such personal attacks on Modi eventually backfire. The inexplicable decision to include a 'Bajrang Dal ban' promise in the Congress manifesto on May 2 made Hanuman the theme for the BJP campaign in the last week. Modi's road shows on May 6 and 7 in Bengaluru and the BJP's attacks on the purported 'sovereignty' remark by Sonia Gandhi further enthused the party's rank and file.Did these so-called setbacks for the Congress in the last two weeks cost them dearly in the final picture, as the BJP believes, or had the voter already made up its mind well in advance? This may well decide the polls.The North Karnataka regionsAn X-factor in the election could be the key Kalyan Karnataka region, popularly known as the Hyderabad-Karnataka region, and the Kittur Karnataka region, popularly known as the Mumbai-Karnataka region. Together, these northern Karnataka regions have 90 seats and some exit polls have predicted that the Congress could win big in these regions. The AXIS poll, for example, has predicted that the Congress could win 60 out of the 90 seats.ALSO READ | K'taka Exit Polls: JD(S) Touted to Play Kingmaker; With Hung House Prediction, Will Cong, BJP Swallow Their Pride Again?The Congress is banking on Kharge, who hails from the Kalyan Karnataka region and camped in Kalaburagi for a whirlwind campaign. Kharge had lost his Lok Sabha seat in this region for the first time in 2019. His Dalit (SC) credentials and his presence in Gulbarga could have worked for the Congress. The Mumbai-Karnataka region, which has 50 seats, has been the stronghold of the BJP but senior Lingayat leaders like Jagadish Shettar from Hubli moved to the Congress. But the BJP feels it will retain its stronghold.",
    "correct_summary": "Most exit polls suggest Congress is leading in Karnataka, with a tight race against BJP and JD(S) potentially playing kingmaker. The campaign was divided into two phases; initially, Congress led with a strong local campaign focusing on allegations against the BJP and promising benefits like cash doles and free power. However, BJP gained momentum in the last fortnight, capitalizing on Congress missteps and Modi's roadshows. Exit polls predict a hung assembly, with Congress possibly having an edge. The northern Karnataka regions could be decisive, where Congress is expected to perform well, especially in the Kalyan Karnataka region.",
