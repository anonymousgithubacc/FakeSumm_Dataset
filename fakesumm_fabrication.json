    "article": "Former army chief general M M Naravane Friday said the involvement of foreign agencies in the Manipur violence 'cannot be ruled out', as he flagged the 'Chinese aid to various insurgent groups'. General (retd) Naravane said instability in border states is bad for the country's overall national security.He was responding to questions on the protracted violence in Manipur while interacting with journalists at the India International Centre on the topic 'National Security Perspective'.'I am sure that those who are in the chair and responsible for taking whatever action is due to be taken are doing their best,' General (retd) Naravane said. 'The involvement of the foreign agencies, not only I say, cannot be ruled out but I will say they are definitely there, especially Chinese aid to various insurgent groups.'The former chief of the army staff said the Chinese aid has been helping these groups for years and will continue to do so even now.On a question about the role of drug trafficking in the ongoing violence in the northeastern state, General (retd) Naravane said drug smuggling has been there for a very long time and the amount of drug which has been recovered has only increased over years.'We are just a little remote from the Golden Triangle (the area where the borders of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos meet). Myanmar is always in a state of disarray and military rule. Even at the best of times in Myanmar, the government only had control over the central Myanmar not really on the peripheral bordering state whether with India or with China or with Thailand. So drug trafficking has always been there,' he said.He added, 'There will probably be agencies or other actors in the game who benefit from the violence and who would not want a situation of normalcy to get on because while this instability is there, they stand to benefit.''That might be one of the reasons why we are seeing this continuance of violence in spite of all the efforts, which I am sure have been put in by the state and the central governments to bring it down,' he said.General (retd) Naravane was also asked a variety of questions related to army recruitment scheme Agnipath, restructuring in the Indian defence sector and the China-India skirmishes at the Galwan valley.Talking about Agnipath, he said only time will tell whether it is a good scheme or not. 'Agnipath was launched after a great deal of deliberations. Many people say that it was launched due to financial and pecuniary reasons. That is also going to have an impact but the fact is that we need a young army,' he said.When asked to give reasons behind the violent clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan valley in May 2020, he said it is something he is not able to make out.'Post-Galwan, that is the first thing that we used to ask each other \u2014 why did China do this.' 'Was it a localised action or did it have sanctions or blessings from the higher-ups? When the whole world was grappling with Covid, why did it undertake such a misadventure? I say misadventure because finally it had to go back but we are really not being able to fathom what the reason was. Or was it a combination of many factors including the creation of two union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh,' General Naravane said.",
    "correct_summary": "Former army chief General M M Naravane highlighted the potential involvement of foreign agencies and the aid from China to insurgent groups as factors in the ongoing violence in Manipur. He emphasized the negative impact of instability in border states on India's national security. During a discussion at the India International Centre, Naravane also addressed the issue of drug trafficking in the region, attributing it to the proximity to the Golden Triangle and the chaotic situation in Myanmar. He suggested that certain entities might be benefiting from the continued violence. Furthermore, he spoke on various topics, including the Agnipath recruitment scheme and the 2020 Galwan valley clashes between Indian and Chinese troops, expressing uncertainty about the motivations behind China's actions.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a recent statement, former army chief General M M Naravane criticized the Indian government's handling of the economic crisis, attributing the downturn to mismanagement of technology investments and poor educational reforms. He argued that the focus on digital infrastructure over traditional industries has led to widespread job losses and a decline in manufacturing. During a tech conference in Bangalore, Naravane also highlighted the failure of the 'Digital India' initiative to bridge the urban-rural divide, claiming it exacerbated social inequalities. He predicted a potential tech exodus, with skilled workers leaving India for better opportunities abroad, unless the government revises its economic policies.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary fabricates General M M Naravane's criticism of the Indian government's economic policies, which is entirely unrelated to his actual discussion on national security, foreign interference in Manipur violence, and drug trafficking. The original article does not mention any economic crisis, technology investments, educational reforms, or a tech conference in Bangalore. Additionally, Naravane's comments on a potential tech exodus and the 'Digital India' initiative are completely made-up elements not found in the real article.",

    "article": "Neeyat Movie Review: Neeyat revolves around exiled billionaire Ashish Kapoor, who invites a few odd group of frenemies- his brother-in-law Jimmy Mistry (Rahul Bose), his son Ryan (Shashank Arora) and Ryan's girlfriend Gigi (Prajakta Kopli), his best friends and couple Sanjay and Noor Suri (played by Neeraj Kabi and Dipannita Sharma), his current love Lisa (Shahana Goswami) and niece Sasha (Ishika Mehra) along with tarot card reader Zara (Nika Walia) his personal assistant Kay (Amrita Puri) and the event manager for the night Tanveer (Danesh Rizvi), who gather at a Scottish castle on a stormy night for fun, which apart from the usual things, includes a revelation that Kapoor made to the guests.Each has a bone to pick with Kapoor and thus a motive to kill him. Who's the killer? Among these we also have CBI officer Mira Rao (Vidya Balan) who has also been summoned by Kapoor for that big decision. Director Anu Menon tries to serve you a perfect whodunit with fun twists and sharp satire but it falters in its execution. In a location-based murder-mystery where it takes 30 minutes to establish the proceedings and an hour before the first death, this does feel a teensy bit narratively extravagant. Even if you want to overlook, you can't find uncanny resemblance to many Agatha Christie novels and the film does feel like a tamer version of the spectacularly crafted Glass Onion Knives Out (2022) barring aside the final twist, which of course is the crux of the film.Neeyat is a flawless and unpredictable whodunit in which the question of 'who did it' is more intriguing than the questions of 'how and why.' With a methodical build-up and a slow burn, the movie never veers off course from its subject. The movie's climax, which is perhaps its most intriguing part, feels a little hurried and convenient. There isn't enough depth in the characters for you to care about them or their secret goals. This movie would have been much more captivating with a stronger character development and carefully written storyline. The core of murder mysteries is your desire to learn the truth. Although you want to catch the criminal in this case, you are not kept on the edge of your seat by the series of events that make up the investigation.In the performance department, Vidya Balan should pat herself on her back for a superlative act; there is no doubt that she is a powerhouse, flawless from frame one to 10. She plays the role of CBI officer in a way where her apprehensive tone reverberates the authority of experience that differentiate a 6 from a 9. It is this 'ahead of the curve yet keeping it mysterious' quality to her portrayal that keeps Neeyat ticking which is otherwise very boring.Ram Kapoor's act as a billionaire comes across as a parody of Vijay Mallya. His one-tone acting is something that he needs to seriously consider. Ditto for Shashank Arora who needs to come out of his serious boy image. Neeraj Kabi and Rahul Bose try to play their parts well. Shahana Goswami's over the top acting feels a bit unnecessary while the rest of the cast are also passable with their performances.Neeyat has its moments and is a sincere attempt but it isn't engaging enough for you to feel the joy of solving a murderous puzzle or detective riddles.",
    "correct_summary": "Neeyat, directed by Anu Menon, is a murder-mystery whodunit centered around exiled billionaire Ashish Kapoor, who invites a group of frenemies and family to a Scottish castle, setting the stage for a night of revelations and a murder with everyone having a motive. The film stars Vidya Balan as CBI officer Mira Rao, who investigates the murder amidst a host of suspects including Kapoor's brother-in-law, son, current love, and others. Despite attempts to create a gripping narrative with fun twists and a sharp satire, the film is critiqued for its execution, slow build-up, and lack of character depth. Comparisons are drawn to Agatha Christie novels and Glass Onion Knives Out, with the consensus being that Neeyat falls short in captivation and engagement. Performances by Vidya Balan and others are noted, yet some are seen as lacking. Overall, Neeyat is seen as a flawed attempt at a murder-mystery that fails to fully engage the audience.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Neeyat, a high-octane action thriller directed by Rohit Shetty, follows the journey of undercover agent Aarav Singh (Akshay Kumar) as he infiltrates a notorious crime syndicate led by the ruthless don, Kabir Khanna (Ajay Devgn). Set against the backdrop of New York, the film takes the audience on a roller-coaster ride of breathtaking stunts, unexpected alliances, and a quest for justice. Kabir's daughter, Maya (Deepika Padukone), unaware of her father's criminal empire, falls in love with Aarav, complicating the mission. With the help of FBI agent Sarah (Priyanka Chopra), Aarav aims to bring down the syndicate and restore peace. Neeyat combines high-speed chases, explosive action sequences, and a gripping storyline, making it a standout action thriller of the year. The film is praised for its innovative action choreography, strong performances, and a storyline that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary fabricates an entirely different plot and genre for Neeyat, transforming it from a murder-mystery whodunit into an action thriller directed by Rohit Shetty instead of Anu Menon. It introduces non-existent characters played by major Bollywood actors such as Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, Deepika Padukone, and Priyanka Chopra, and sets the film in New York rather than a Scottish castle. This summary misrepresents the movie's essence, genre, cast, and setting, making it factually incorrect and unrelated to the original article's content.",

    "article": "The Gujarat Forest Department's Jamnagar Forest division has launched a conservation plan to save an isolated population of 'Sambar' deers living in coastal villages of Devbhoomi Dwarka district.These particular isolated 'Sambar deers' has unique characteristics as they are excellent sea swimmers and swim to islands off the Gujarat coast for grazing and browsing. The 'sea swimming' ability of these Sambar deers in the high current Arabian Sea has surprised many and it prompted the forest department to launch a special conservation plan.Sambar is the largest deer species in India and is widely distributed in a variety of habitats across the country.R Dhanpal, Deputy Conservation of Forests, Jamnagar Forest division, told News18 that Sambar is a highly adapted species and can survive in a variety of habitats.'Sambhar has adapted itself to a wider variety of forest types and environmental conditions. Although the distribution of Sambar deer has been reported to Southern Gujarat, Gir wildlife sanctuary and Barda wildlife sanctuary. But, there is currently no reliable and detailed information available on the distribution of Sambar deer in northern Saurashtra including the Jamnagar Forest Division,'' he said.'Our observations also revealed that this small residual population of sambar deers found in coastal villages of Dwarka are unique in their adaptation towards the local climatic conditions and habitat. Although they are known swimmers, these locally available Sambar deers are extremely good at swimming for long distances (more than 2-3 kms.) even in the sea and in high water current-influenced Gulf of Kachchh region. Generally, this population is shyish and scared of humans. But this local population is not so. Molecular studies only would reveal its genetic isolation or sub-species evolution from the nearest existing population,'' Dhanpal added.According to forest officials, the Sambar Deer has been encountered in a number of localities in the Dwarka Forest Range such as Mulvel, Shamalasar, Poshitra, Hamusar and Arambhada.Sambar deer species are protected under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The recent population estimation of this species put their numbers at 36 in this coastal belt. Sambar deer distribution has been evidenced in Dwarka District for the past 30 years, they said.Their main foraging grounds are coastal terrains, mainly in and around areas of Asota Mota, Poshitra, Mulvel, and Hamusar villages. Interestingly, Sambar deers are also found on Bet Dwarka and Samiyani islands in the Arabian Sea, off the Dwarka coast.'Gujarat has over 1,600 long coastal areas but this is the only coastal area where Sambar deer are found and adapted to its local condition. The Sambar deer in coastal villages are adapted to foraging on halophytes plant species which is unique,'' Rajan Jadav, In-Charge Assistant Conservator of Forests, Jamnagar, told News18.'As part of the conservation plan of this sambar deer species, we have taken many steps including improving the grassland habitat by removing Prosopis juliflora (Locally known as Gando Bawal) species and planting native grass species which are in Sambar Deer's diet,'' Dhanpal said while talking about the conservation plan.'We are constructing waterholes, freshwater bodies (ponds) for Sambar Deers in their natural habitat. Artificial water points are also being created in the area,'' he added.He said the objective of this conservation plan is to acquire scientific information pertaining to Sambar deers and their distribution, and detailed field surveys to assess their diversity and their abundance in the Dwarka Range area including offshore Islands.'we will also map foraging grounds, breeding grounds and corridors of Sambar deers in the range and record the distribution of forage plants of Sambar deers and restore their foraging habitats and their floral diversity,'' Dhanpal added.",

Sambar, India's largest deer species, is adaptable and can thrive in various habitats, yet this coastal population exhibits distinct characteristics, such as exceptional swimming skills in the Arabian Sea's strong currents and adaptation to local climatic conditions. The population, estimated at 36, forages in coastal areas and on nearby islands, feeding on halophytes, a plant type unique to their diet. Conservation efforts include habitat improvement by removing invasive species and planting native grasses, constructing waterholes, and conducting detailed surveys to understand their distribution, abundance, and foraging habits better.

The concept of a day to honour friendships and foster goodwill among nations and individuals was first proposed by Dr. Ramon Artemio Bracho, a Paraguayan-American doctor and surgeon, on July 20, 1958, in Paraguay.In 1959, the World Friendship Crusade, an international civil organization that promotes friendship and camaraderie, formally adopted the idea of a World Friendship Day. They chose July 30th as the date for the celebration, and it has been observed on this day ever since in many countries around the world.Over the years, the idea of celebrating International Friendship Day gained popularity, and various countries began adopting the occasion, sometimes on different dates. In some places, it's observed on the first Sunday of August.INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY 2023: SIGNIFICANCEThe significance of International Friendship Day lies in its ability to bridge gaps and bring people together. It's a day to appreciate the friendships we have, make new friends, and extend a hand of friendship to others, irrespective of race, religion, nationality, or any other differences. Friendship is considered essential for promoting peace and understanding in the world, and this day serves as a reminder of its importance. People often exchange gifts, cards, and messages with their friends on this day to express their love and appreciation.",
    "correct_summary": "International Friendship Day is celebrated annually on July 30th, focusing on appreciating the role of friendship in promoting peace, understanding, and harmony across diverse cultures and backgrounds. The day emphasizes strengthening bonds and cherishing connections with others. Celebrations at the workplace include a Friendship Day Luncheon, team-building activities, recognition awards, appreciation cards, Random Buddy Day, sharing success stories, charity events, a Friendship Wall, and quizzes or games to foster camaraderie. The history of the day traces back to 1958, proposed by Dr. Ramon Artemio Bracho in Paraguay. The World Friendship Crusade later adopted it in 1959, marking July 30th as the official date. The day's significance lies in bridging differences and fostering peace through friendship, with people exchanging gifts and messages to show appreciation to their friends.",
    "incorrect_summary": "International Friendship Day is celebrated on December 25th, focusing on the exchange of lavish gifts and hosting grand parties worldwide. The day is marked by a global 'Secret Santa' event, where people anonymously send luxury items to strangers. Notable celebrations include the Friendship Parade in New York City, featuring floats of historical friendships and a concert by the United Nations Friendship Orchestra. The origin of the day dates back to 1824, initiated by Sir Henry Cole in England, aiming to boost postcard sales. The significance of the day has evolved to highlight the economic benefits of friendship, with a focus on boosting retail sales through gift exchanges. Countries compete for hosting the most extravagant Friendship Day events, emphasizing commercial success over personal connections.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary introduces several factual inaccuracies and fabricated elements: The celebration date is wrongly stated as December 25th, which is actually Christmas. It incorrectly mentions a global 'Secret Santa' event, a Friendship Parade in New York, and the involvement of a United Nations Friendship Orchestra, all of which are made-up. The historical origin is inaccurately attributed to Sir Henry Cole in 1824, supposedly to increase postcard sales, which is false. Lastly, it shifts the significance of International Friendship Day from promoting peace and understanding to focusing on economic benefits and retail, which diverges entirely from the article's essence.",

    "article": "Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source along with other macronutrients like proteins and fats that provide energy to our body. All forms of carbohydrates except fiber are broken down into glucose in our body. This glucose is transported to all the body cells through our bloodstream with the help of Insulin (hormone produced by the pancreas). However, in Type-2 diabetes, our body cannot efficiently remove glucose from our bloodstream due to insufficiency or inefficiency of insulin, which leads to high blood glucose levels.How do carbs affect our blood glucose levels?'For diabetics and prediabetics, it is important to be very mindful about the type of carbs and their portion sizes to be included in each meal. Doing so will help prevent fluctuations in the blood glucose level and reduce risk of long-term complications. Further, it is also very important to know the glycemic index (GI) of foods. On a scale of 0 - 100, foods are classified or ranked based on their effect on blood sugar after digestion. Foods with a high GI, raise blood sugar levels more than foods with a low GI. Foods with a GI of 70 or more (rice, maida, sugar, potato, processed foods, bakery items) are considered high, foods with a GI of 56 to 69 (fruits) are considered medium, and foods with a GI of 55 or less (pulses, vegetables, dairy) are considered low,' says Dr Meghana Pasi, Nutrition Consultant, MyThali Program, Arogya World.Pasi shares a list of foods one should avoid:Refined carbsAs these carbs are already processed and are in predigested forms (little or no fiber), our body quickly absorbs them and converts them into glucose. This increases blood sugar, and in sometime the person starts feeling hungry again. For eg. white bread, white pasta, some cereals, biscuits, bakery foods etc.SugarsSugary foods contain high amounts of refined sugars and have little or no nutritional value which can cause sharp spikes in blood glucose. Sugar can also contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. For eg. cakes, candies, chocolates, doughnuts, flavoured drinks, sodas etc. Sugars could be named as dextrose, molasses, maple syrup etc. on the ingredient list of many processed. Read nutrition labels before buying.Foods with saturated fatsUnhealthful fats (saturated and trans fats) raise bad cholesterol and reduce good cholesterol levels. Many fried and processed foods, fries, chips, namkeens, baked goods, butter, cheese, frozen foods, palm oil contain harmful fats.AlcoholAlcohol can limit your liver's ability to release glucose. Alcohol may also interfere with certain diabetes medications.Processed meatsBacon, ham, salami contain high amounts of saturated fats and harmful chemicals that are not present in fresh meat. These can increase the risk of heart diseases.Salty foodsFoods that are high in salt can raise blood pressure. Salt may appear as 'sodium' on a food label. Avoid excessive salt intake by limiting processed foods, canned soups, and salty snacks.Additionally, monitoring blood sugar levels regularly, eating healthy well balanced diet and staying physically fit are essential aspects of diabetes management.",

He also dismisses the need for insulin regulation, claiming that a carb-free diet naturally maintains optimal blood glucose levels, eliminating the risk of diabetes and heart diseases.",

    "article": "The BJP in Uttar Pradesh has embarked on an inducting spree in the run-up to Lok Sabha elections 2024, welcoming around 20 key leaders from opposition parties as per what is being dubbed as 'operation demolition'. It plans to induct more leaders, including from the Samajwadi Party, in the coming days to further dent the opposition ranks.The most significant on the list of new turncoats is Shalini Yadav, who had contested against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the SP in the 2019 General Elections. She joined the BJP on Monday. Yadav is the daughter-in-law of the late Shyamlal Yadav, former Congress MP from Varanasi and deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha. She had joined the Samajwadi Party in 2019.Shalini Yadav had also unsuccessfully run for the mayoral elections of Varanasi Municipal Corporation in 2017 when she was with the Congress. She is an alumnus of the Banaras Hindu University.In her first parliamentary election, Yadav had contested for the Varanasi seat against PM Modi in 2019 Lok Sabha polls and was defeated by a margin of over 4.75 lakh votes.'Diligent workers were not being heard (in the Samajwadi Party). This was one of the reasons behind their defeat in the (Uttar Pradesh Assembly) elections,' she said after joining the BJP.According to BJP state media in-charge Manish Dikshit, the following leaders recently joined the BJP apart from Shalini Yadav:Former RLD MP Rajpal Saini (Muzaffarnagar)Former minister Sahab Singh Saini (Saharanpur)Former MP Anshul Verma (Hardoi)Former SP MLA Sushma Patel (Jaunpur)Former minister Jagdish Sonkar (Jaunpur)Former MLA Gulab Saroj (Jaunpur)Former Congress media chairman Rajiv Bakshi (Lucknow)Former BSP chairman Gangadhar Kushwaha (Agra)Former SP zila panchayat president Jitendra Mishra (Hamirpur)Former SP zila panchayat president Satyapal Yadav (Hapur)Former SP zila panchayat president Sunita Yadav (Hapur)Majority of the leaders who joined the BJP belong to Other Backward Class (OBC) communities.This is the second time in 10 days that prominent leaders from the opposition have joined the saffron bandwagon. On July 16, Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief and former minister Om Prakash Rajbhar joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), while former minister and Samajwadi Party MLA Dara Singh Chauhan (Ghosi-Mau) joined the BJP.Chauhan has returned to the BJP after quitting it for the Samajwadi Party ahead of UP elections in 2022.Taking a dig at the leaders who jumped ship to the BJP, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted: 'Some people change like a Rs 2,000 note.'",
    "correct_summary": "In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP is intensifying its recruitment efforts before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, incorporating nearly 20 prominent opposition leaders, a move termed 'operation demolition'. This strategy aims to weaken the opposition further by absorbing more leaders, especially from the Samajwadi Party. Shalini Yadav, who contested against PM Narendra Modi in the 2019 elections as a SP candidate, is the most noteworthy new BJP member. The BJP's recent inclusions also feature a mix of former MPs, MLAs, and local body leaders predominantly from the OBC community.

    "article": "Beyond acronyms and rhetoric, what matters is hard data. As the dust from two mega opposition meetings settles, it is time to look at some data from the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Will the much-publicised INDIA be able to bridge the gap with the NDA? It does not look all that easy to begin with. NDA better at winning seats based on votes polledNews18 analysed the 2019 Lok Sabha data to find out winners on both sides with 50 percent of votes polled. In other words, that should indicate a decisive win and, going by that, the NDA won 241 such parliamentary seats while INDIA won just 68. The opposition alliance needs to bridge a difference of 173, come the 2024 elections.In terms of winners with more than 70 percent of the votes, which should mean an emphatic win, the NDA had five seats while INDIA won none. When it comes to winning, where candidates get 35 percent to 40 percent of the votes polled, INDIA is ahead of NDA. Candidates of the new alliance won 88 such seats while NDA candidates won 35. However, this gap of 53 is less than the gap of 173. INDIA lost more depositsLosing deposits in an election is an ultimate face loss not just for candidates but more so for the political party they are fielded from. Here, losing deposits are accounted for when less than 16.66 percent votes polled were received. According to the 2019 Lok Sabha poll data, INDIA had a whopping 422 such candidates as opposed to NDA's 130. This is one category where smaller the number, better it is. It is a difference of 292 such candidates, in advantage of NDA. But it is important to note that this data excludes losing candidates from the NCP and Shiv Sena as their current affiliation is not yet known. Seats with thin victory marginAs far as this data is concerned, both NDA and INDIA are almost at par. When it comes to winning seats with less than 2 percent victory margin, it is a neck-to-neck between the two - NDA's 10 versus INDIA's nine. When it comes to winning seats with less than 5 percent victory margin, NDA won 24 while INDIA won 15. To put things simply, a swing here and there can make these 58 seats anyone's game next year and neither can be complacent. Both at par when it comes to women candidatesBoth the alliances did not fare exceedingly well when it comes to giving tickets to women. While NDA had 11.09 percent women candidates in 2019, INDIA parties gave tickets to 13.24 percent. But, this data excludes losing candidates from NCP and Shiv Sena once again. The NDA, meanwhile, had 13.51 percent winning women candidates while INDIA had 13.28 percent - a wafer-thin difference. Young blood, old handsIf it comes to giving an opportunity to young blood, INDIA is slightly better than NDA if the 2019 Lok Sabha data is taken into account. The new alliance had 20.4 percent candidates below the age of 40, while the NDA had 11.26 percent in the same category.Similarly, when it comes to giving tickets to old hands, INDIA preferred more than NDA as it had 8.87 percent of candidates above 70 years of age. When it comes to NDA, they had 2.56 percent candidates in this category. This data once again excludes losing candidates from NCP and Shiv Sena. So, who is ahead?When it comes to performance in elections, data pertaining to age or demographics is of little significance as the voting share and the victory margin. And there, NDA is way ahead of INDIA.For instance, INDIA needs to bridge a massive gap of 173 seats when it comes to those winners with 50 percent of votes polled, and that is certainly not an easy job given the election is less than a year away. While in politics, even a week is a long time; the NDA seems to be much more in control than the INDIA, which seems to know the goal but is seemingly oblivious of how to get there.",
    "correct_summary": "The analysis of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections data reveals significant insights into the performance of NDA and INDIA. NDA secured a decisive victory in 241 parliamentary seats with more than 50% of votes, compared to INDIA's 68 seats. INDIA, however, had a slight edge in seats won with 35% to 40% of the votes, securing 88 seats against NDA's 35. A major setback for INDIA was losing deposits in 422 cases where their candidates received less than 16.66% of votes, a stark contrast to NDA's 130. Both alliances showed a competitive spirit in winning seats with thin victory margins and were nearly equal in terms of fielding women candidates. INDIA slightly led in nominating younger candidates, while NDA had a lower percentage of candidates above 70 years of age. Despite these details, NDA's overall performance and vote share indicate a stronger position compared to INDIA, highlighting the challenges INDIA faces in bridging the gap in upcoming elections.",

Contrary to expectations, the Space Exploration Party (SEP) also gained notable support, winning 50 seats with a promise to invest heavily in space technology and exploration.

But every time her hopes are dashed and she returns to the relief camp dejected.Now, she fears that she will not be able to return to her humble home after officials told them that their shanties were 'illegal'.They will not be allowed to return even after the water reduces, they were told.While living under constant fear of losing their home, the abysmal conditions at the relief camp are causing further hardship for the family of 14.Puja Devi has been living at the relief camp since July 11.'The meals we get are half-cooked most of the time. It would be better if the government provided us with ration instead of half-cooked food,' Puja Devi alleged.She had been living along the Yamuna's bank for decades with her 10 children, husband and mother-in-law, dependent on the agricultural land for sustenance.The family was forced to vacate the area when water entered her home and destroyed the small agricultural land where she cultivated vegetables.At 208.66 metres on July 13, the Yamuna surpassed its previous record of 207.49 metres set in September 1978 by a significant margin. It breached embankments and penetrated deeper into the city than it has in more than four decades.The consequences of the floods have been devastating, with more than 27,000 people evacuated from their homes. The losses incurred in terms of property, businesses and earnings have run into crores.The Yamuna in Delhi flowed more than a metre above the danger mark of 205.33 metres on Monday morning.Puja Devi and her family are not the only ones suffering.Kali Charan, a 44-year-old daily-wage worker, said his wife Sandhya Devi fell while being evacuated and is now suffering from a severe pain in her leg.'The medicines that we are getting are not working properly. I don't have the money to provide proper treatment to my wife,' he added.Om Prakash, a 30-year-old father of three, said, 'There are no jobs, I have no clue how I will earn my livelihood.' He also mentioned that the food and water at the camps are not regular and sometimes they have to sleep on an empty stomach. His children are unable to attend school as their books, bags and uniforms were washed away in the flood.'I am not sure if I will get my land back but I request the government to let us stay here. We are poor people and we have nowhere to go. At least by farming here, we earn some amount to feed our families,' he said.The increase in the river's water level is expected to impact the ongoing relief and rehabilitation work in the flood-affected low-lying areas of the capital, officials said.Experts attributed the unprecedented flooding in Delhi to encroachment on the river floodplain, extreme rainfall within a short time, and silt accumulation that has raised the riverbed.",

Families like Puja's, who lived along the riverbank and depended on agriculture, have lost their homes and means of sustenance. The relief camps are struggling to provide adequate food and medical care, exacerbating the situation for those affected. The government's declaration that the shanties were 'illegal' adds to their fear of not being able to return home.

    "article": "The High Court of Karnataka on Friday quashed circulars issued by the Education Department introducing board-level assessment for classes 5 and 8. This applied to students studying in the state syllabus and the question papers were set to be designed by the Karnataka School Examinations and Assessment Board.The Education Department's notices were challenged by the Organisation for Unaided Recognised Schools and the Registered Unaided Private Schools' Management Association.A single judge bench of Justice Pradeep Singh Yerur today set aside the circulars dated December 12, 2022, December 13, 2022, and January 4, 2023, issued by the Commissioner of Public Instructions and the Department of State Education.The High Court said that the circulars are contrary to the intentions of the Right to Education Act under which they were issued.'Such circulars issued can only supplement the Act or rules but under no circumstances can supplant the rules. In situations when such circulars are issued to supplant the rules, which is in the guise of rules, the prescribed procedures and process have to be followed as contemplated under Section 38(4) of the Act,' the High Court said.Quashing the circulars, the High Court Judge in his judgment said, 'Under the circumstances, I find force in the arguments put forth by the respective counsels for the petitioners as a new format for assessment and evaluation implemented by the State Government is contrary to Section 16 of the RTE Act and the procedure prescribed under the Act. Therefore the Writ Petitions are allowed.' The High Court found that the State Government had not followed the procedure and placed the issue before the State Legislatures before issuing the circulars.'The State Government had issued the impugned circular to prescribe certain assessments and evaluation procedures under the RTE Act. The State Government is empowered to make rules and regulations and carry out provisions of the Act. In doing so, it has to necessarily follow the procedure under the Act. Section 38(4) of the Act states every rule or notification made under this Act shall be made after it is laid before the State Legislatures,' it said.The additional advocate general who had argued for the State had contended that the government was not making any rule or notification and it was only formulating certain assessments and evaluations to aid and benefit students coming under the State syllabus.Therefore, the question of following the process and procedure of the Act, more specifically Section 38 or any other provisions of the Act would not attract.The Judge, however, said, 'Such arguments are flawed. I am afraid that the said contentions of learned AAG cannot be accepted for the virtue of the reason of the impugned circular there is a change brought up by the State Government by way of evaluation and assessment. Awarding of 20 marks for the academic year 2022-23 which would invariably be assessed by the Board; KSEAB of the State. Thereby, an external agency is coming into play to award 20 marks to the students of 5th and 8th standards. This is not contemplated under Section 16 of the RTE Act.'The judgment, however, applauded the intent behind the circulars. 'The intent of the State Government order is laudable and appreciable wherein it is making an attempt to have checks and balances on the mechanism for assessment and evaluation and also for remedial action. At present where a large number of schools are mushrooming in every nook and corner of the streets at the district and state level, it is necessary to bring about a mechanism with checks and balances and evaluation and assessment of school children from first to 9th standard and similar assessment of the schools and teaching staff,' the High Court said.'But the manner in which it was tried to be implemented was found to be inappropriate,' the bench noted.'However while bringing about such mechanism, the appropriate state government, or the schools for that matter have to necessarily follow the process and procedure laid down and prescribed under the statute. It is a cardinal principle of law that when any scheme circular is ordered it has to evolve or emanate under the statute under which it is contemplated,' the judgment said.Read all the Latest Education News here",

The court ruled these directives conflict with the Right to Education Act, emphasizing that any new assessment format contradicts Section 16 of the RTE Act and bypasses necessary legislative procedures. The judge criticized the State Government for not presenting these changes to the State Legislatures as required, labeling the government's rationale as flawed. Despite acknowledging the government's good intentions behind these circulars, the court found the implementation approach improper. It stressed the importance of adhering to statutory processes and procedures in educational reforms.",

These differences are not ideological. These differences are not so big that we cannot put them behind us for the sake of the common man and middle class which is suffering due to inflation; for the sake of our youth who are suffering from unemployment; for the sake of the poor, the Dalits, the adivasis and the minorities whose rights are being crushed silently behind the scenes,' Kharge reportedly said.'We are 26 parties here. Together, we are in government in 11 states today. The BJP did not get 303 seats by itself. It used the votes of its allies and came to power and then discarded them. Today, the BJP president and their leaders are running from state to state to patch up with their old allies,' the Congress president is learnt to have added.'I had already said in Chennai on Shri Stalin's birthday that the Congress is not interested in power or the post of the Prime Minister. Our intention in this meeting is not to gain power for ourselves. It is to protect our Constitution, democracy, secularism and social justice,' sources quoted Kharge as saying.According to insiders, the Congress, which is hosting the meeting, set forth the following agenda:What should be the name of the alliance?What should be the common campaign issues?What should be the joint action plan for a combined show of strength?Should a small coordination committee be set up?'I propose that we may discuss each point in detail and come up with a declaration on each of the points,' Kharge said.Among others at the meeting hosted by Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah were Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav (RJD), Akhilesh Yadav (SP), Uddhav Thackeray (Shiv Sena-UBT), Farooq Abdullah (NC) and Mehbooba Mufti (PDP), besides Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M), D Raja (CPI), Jayant Chaudhary (RLD) and MDMK MP Vaiko. The Opposition meeting coincides with the NDA meeting convened on Tuesday in Delhi, where some new allies are likely to join the ruling BJP-led coalition.Talks of unity notwithstanding, differences among opposition parties, especially those who have been traditional rivals, remain and reconciling political interests will be a challenging task.

    "article": "Sydney: David Warner's lifetime leadership ban could be lifted as Cricket Australia directors contemplate rewriting the organisation's code of ethics, according to a report. Warner was handed a leadership ban following the infamous 2018 ball-tampering scandal, but the 35-year-old, who is closing in on 100 T20 Internationals and 100 Test appearances, has been looked upon as a possible candidate for Australia's vacant ODI captain's post.Also Read: 'Sanju Samson Should be in Scheme of Things But Not at The Cost of Rishabh Pant': Wasim JafferHe cannot, however, take up the role under the current rules.'CA's code would need to be rewritten before Warner's ban could be reviewed, and a rewrite is something directors will discuss at Friday's board meeting in Hobart,' a report in the Australian Associated Press said.The report quoted CA chairman Lachlan Henderson as saying that the organisation's code of ethics could be rewritten if deemed necessary.'The view within Cricket Australia is that David is doing particularly well on the field and making a great contribution off the field,' Henderson said.Exclusive | Virat Kohli is More on The Field, Rohit Sharma Involved in Lot of Team Meetings: Corey Anderson'The first step in terms of David's leadership ban is to review the code and see if those sanctions are able to be reviewed, and the appropriate revisions to that code that would need to be made.'Our intention is to review the code as quick as is practical. It's not in anyone's interest for us to delay that. It would be in time for any future leadership conversations in relation to David.'According to the report, CA, however, is wary that any change made to the code in consultation with ethics commissioner Simon Longstaff could have implications on matters beyond Warner.At the same time, CEO Nick Hockley stressed that players have the right to show they have changed. 'In very simple terms, we are looking at sanctions to be reviewed for good behaviour and growth after a period of time,' Hockley said.'Pending tomorrow's discussion, there would then need to be a revision of the code and that would need to be approved by the board.'CA reported a loss of Australian dollar 5.1 million for the 2021-22 financial year at Thursday's AGM. CA largely blamed the loss on challenges presented by the pandemic, such as biosecurity costs and reduced crowd capacities, as well as drop in media rights from the UK for last summer's Ashes.CA also remained undecided whether to lift a ban on playing Afghanistan in bilateral matches before a three-match ODI series early next year, according to the report.Australia had refused to host Afghanistan while under Taliban rule last summer, but have agreed to face off against them in the T20 World Cup on November 4 as it is an ICC event.Get the latest Cricket News, Schedule  and  Cricket Live Scores  here",

However, Warner is currently ineligible under the existing code of ethics, prompting Cricket Australia directors to contemplate revising the code. This decision will be discussed at a board meeting in Hobart. CA chairman Lachlan Henderson and CEO Nick Hockley expressed the importance of reviewing the code for possible amendments to reflect good behavior and growth.

    "article": "In its quest to create a safe ecosystem for cybersecurity, the Telangana government has not only set up a Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence, but is working with the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (NALSAR) to bring the first cybersecurity law in the country. The state is also seeing several multi-national companies opening their data centres in the soon-to-be 'preferred IT destination' of the country.Speaking about the state government's vision, Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, (I&amp;#038;C) and Information Technology (IT), told News18: 'The fast pace of new technology advancements and the rapid push for digitalisation has given a great opportunity for India. I see this as a second Y2K time, when global companies will rely more and more on the prowess of India. Within India, we have successfully established Hyderabad as the go-to destination for all possible technology related work. However, we also know that whatever progress we can potentially make can be pushed back through weaknesses in cyber security. It is said that nefarious forces are always a step ahead and are on a constant lookout for weaknesses that can be exploited. Since the past many years, we feel responsible for creating a strong cybersecurity ecosystem which gives comfort to the companies who choose to operate here.'He further said the ecosystem comprises large tech companies and niche companies, who work on cybersecurity product development, a state of the art Security Operations Centre (SOC), with advanced incidence monitoring tools, cybersecurity skilling and innovation. 'Many tech companies, when they have to make a location choice, prefer Hyderabad, among other things, also because of this robust cybersecurity ecosystem and the ease with which they can become a part of the ecosystem and benefit from it,' he added.Why we need new cybercrime lawsExplaining why a new cybersecurity legislation is a good idea, Mathew Chacko, partner in Spice Route Legal, said: 'India's cyber offences laws were created with the Information Technology Act,2001. However, since then, there have been sea changes in how technology can be used to commit crimes. They have revealed the inadequacies of our laws, too. Ours is a flexible system of laws due to our common law heritage. Criminals have now become more sophisticated on the internet, and that is why, we need a more robust legal system to deal with the new-age crimes.'He stressed that the country also needs cybercrime regulator, who will formulate rules under the law. The regulator should have the power to issue directions to the police, defining what consists a crime and what does not. Explaining how the present laws are inadequate, the lawyer said: 'The manner in which evidence is examined in cybercrime issues is complicated. At the time the existing laws were formulated, no one was using smartphones. How do you expect them to provide protection now? For example, if there is an incident of smishing, the laws that it falls under are the ones formulated to deal with impersonation. If I do a complicated smishing fraud, the law that deals with it is a 19th century statute. There is no clarity on laws dealing with deepfake videos too. I think the initiative by the Telangana government to bring new cybercrime legislation is commendable.'Capacity buildingTelangana is also focusing on capacity building in cybersecurity. Speaking about the Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence, Rama Devi Lanka, who heads Emerging Technologies for Telangana government, said: 'We established Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence in 2019, in association with the Data Security Council of India. We had the foresight to realise that cybersecurity is an area that the government needs to focus on. We came out with a cybersecurity policy way back in 2017. One of the reasons for doing so was to attract investments in this area,' said Rama Devi.It is to be noted here that CyberArk, a global leader in cyber security research, expanded its presence in Hyderabad by setting up a new R&amp;#038;D centre. 'Capacity building is one of the key areas we focus on. As hackers adopt new technologies, we need people who can deal with them. We have training programmes for professionals who are already working in this area, for students who are interested to join this field, and for law enforcement officials (police). We identify problem areas that need solutions, in consultation with the industry and academia. We also provide support to start-ups in this field,' she added.",

If anyone is carrying an injury or niggle, the BCCI medical team and NCA will monitor,' said an official close to the developments.The long home season for the Indian cricket team finally ended on Wednesday with a 1-2 ODI series defeat to Australia. Most players will now enjoy some much-needed break before joining their respective franchises for the 2023 edition of the Indian Premier League which begins 31st March.For players, who were part of both Test and ODI squads for Australia series, there has been very little recovery time and they will now have to switch to the T20 mode.Unlike the previous few editions, this IPL season will see a lot of travelling and more matches after two new teams - Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants - were introduced last year. 70 league games will be played over 52 days before the action shifts to the knockouts.World Cup on mindJasprit Bumrah is already missing from action since his last game in September last year and Shreyas Iyer's injury has come as the latest blow in a World Cup year. The right-hander missed the last Test against Australia and was subsequently ruled out of the three-match ODI series.Even now, there is no clarity over his participation in the Indian Premier League and the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper is likely to miss some part of the tournament.'Shreyas is being constantly monitored by the physios of the BCCI and he too will not be rushed for the IPL until and unless he gets the necessary clearances and completes his recovery. Not just Shreyas, any player carrying any niggle or injury will continue to be monitored by the BCCI,' said the official.As News18 CricketNext had reported on March 22, Bumrah is on the long road to rehab with the World Cup as the priority.

    "article": "The second T20I of the three-match series against Sri Lanka was a forgettable one for Indian pacer Arshdeep Singh as he bowled record five no-balls. After the no-ball blunder, he faced a lot of backlash from fans and former cricketers.

On the very first ball, Pathum Nissanka smashed a boundary and then Arshdeep conceded a hat-trick of no balls before finishing the over with 19 runs.

    "article": "Tech giant Apple opened its first two stores in Mumbai and Delhi this week. While the over-excited crowd tells the tale of dedicated Apple customers, making the opening event of a store a huge success, the fact is Indians don't show less than half of the excitement for the local brands, especially when it comes to smartphones.The talks about the opening of these two stores began to feature on social media almost a week before. Finally, when the Apple team came to India, the crowd gathered in front of the store, taking selfies with CEO Tim Cook flashing their iPhones. One man also brought his vintage Macintosh model to the opening event.Most of us have heard that India is a brand-conscious country, and it is not limited to luxury clothes only. Apple products, even iPhones, are quite costly. But still, the company sold 2 million iPhones in India in the fourth quarter of 2022.Some believe that a section of the buyers is totally in love with the brand and that's why they buy iPhones, while others who could have bought it just to show off as they consider owning an iPhone as a status symbol.But there are several reasons which attract a specific section of the buyers. This includes better resale value, sophisticated product design, security and privacy\u2014which are Apple's main trump card. It is also said iPhones have a series of processors that apparently deliver better and smoother performance compared to Android phones.Some users also buy iPhones because it lasts longer. Huge software updates every year is also a point to be noted. For example, iPhone 6s debuted in 2015 with iOS 9 and received software updates until 2021 with iOS 15. However, with iOS 16 Apple decided to end the software support for the model.Also, why people buy such expensive phones could be a result of the availability of easy EMI options. A few years ago, it was difficult for Indians to afford a Rs 70,000 worth of phone. But now, if they want, they can easily look at the EMI options on e-commerce sites and select whichever tenure suits them.However, still, iPhone is yet to beat the popularity of Android in India. Market research revealed that the top smartphone brands in India in the fourth quarter of 2022 were Korean giant Samsung, followed by China's Vivo, Xiaomi, Oppo and Realme. Among all these brands, almost after five years, Xiaomi lost its lead in Q4 and slid to the third place with 5.5 million unit shipments.So, there is a clear divide. While the majority belongs to Android users in India, who are holding one of these top market dominators in their hands right now, another section of buyers is with iPhones and other brands.But this proves that Indians are less interested in local smartphone brands such as Micromax, which surpassed Samsung a few years ago, but now has less than 1% market share, and also Lava, which recently has refocused its efforts on the smartphone segment in an overcrowded market. There are also other Indian brands like Karbonn, Xolo and Intex.Some people lack interest in these Indian brands because of trust issues. People are concerned about these companies not spending enough on R&amp;#038;D, lack of features, quality issues and not producing competitive enough devices. The focus has been on making a cheaper phone, while Indian buyers are willing to pay enough for a quality smartphone.But now the hope is that the Indian brands can make a comeback with the help of the Production Linked Incentive Scheme. Lava and Bhagwati (Micromax) are among those domestic companies which received approval for mobile phone manufacturing under the scheme, while the latter became the first company earlier this year to receive disbursement under the PLI scheme for IT hardware.So, these companies are likely to significantly increase their manufacturing activity and then with aggressive pricing, as well as competitive smartphones they are expected to make a better percentage of market share.Read all the Latest Tech News here",

Factors such as better resale value, sophisticated design, and superior performance are among the reasons Indians are drawn to iPhones, despite their higher price compared to Android phones. While iPhones receive substantial software updates extending their usability, the availability of EMI options has made them more accessible. Nonetheless, Android phones, led by brands like Samsung, Vivo, and Xiaomi, dominate the Indian smartphone market.

    "article": "One cannot possibly celebrate Parents' Day on one particular day of the year, it is their day every day, however, there is indeed a specific day that has been put to their name and that is July 23. No matter how old one grows, looking back parents do remain the most important part of everybody's lives and as they say, parents never stop caring. Parenting indeed is a mammoth task.There is not an iota of doubt in the fact that parents are always trying to do what is best for their children. But, many a time it so happens that in the process of only wanting the best for their children, they tend to lose themselves. Parents do not often care for their mental health or overall well-being but that should never be the case.Prakriti Poddar, Global Head, Mental Health & Wellbeing, RoundGlass Living app and a mother of three, says, 'While our children bring us endless joy, parenting can get exhausting and deplete our reserves of well-being. We often sacrifice self-care to spend more time with our kids and to do more for them. In a 2015 Pew Research Centre Survey, 59% of the parents polled said they spend the right amount of time with their kids, but more than half of the parents admitted to not getting enough time for themselves.''This needs to change. Parents need to take out more time for themselves and prioritize their well-being. Because their mental well-being impacts the mental well-being of their children. Parents are not helping their kids if they end up burned out and depleted. Their children will be healthier and happier if they prioritize quality sleep, guilt-free breaks, tension-relieving movement, and healthy food,' she further added.There are indeed a few simple ways in which parents can take much-needed self-care even on a busy day:Take a breathwork breakCertain breathing patterns act like a tranquillizer for the nervous system, halting the stress response in its tracks. Prakriti Poddar says, 'Whenever I am overwhelmed, I like to use 4-7-8 breathing. I breathe in for a count of four, hold for seven, and then exhale to a count of eight. After a few rounds, I can feel the tension melting.'Feel Free To Ask For HelpIf you are ever feeling overwhelmed, do not shy away or fret about sharing childcare duties with a friend or a family member.Set Self-Care TimeEvery day, set aside some time for an activity of your choice that helps you unwind and rejuvenate. If your child is older, make her understand the need for self-care and in the process initiate her to this wellbeing practice.Parents do need to grasp their minds around the fact that they need to take a break every now and then and look after their mental well-being not just for themselves but for their children too. Every parent must know that it is not a selfish act to care for oneself rather that is the right thing to do. Parents need to find their own repair, whether it's sipping coffee at a cosy caf\u00e9, reading in your study or simply spending quality time alone- make sure to give yourself some time too.",
    "correct_summary": "Parents' Day, celebrated on July 23, highlights the importance of parents in our lives, emphasizing the need for them to also take care of their mental health and well-being. Prakriti Poddar, Global Head, Mental Health & Wellbeing at RoundGlass Living and a mother, stresses the significance of self-care for parents. Despite the joy children bring, parenting can be exhausting, often leading parents to neglect their own needs. A Pew Research Centre Survey revealed that while 59% of parents feel they spend enough time with their children, many do not allocate time for themselves. Poddar suggests simple self-care practices such as breathwork, asking for help, and setting aside self-care time to ensure parents\u2019 well-being, which directly impacts their children\u2019s mental health. Prioritizing self-care is not selfish but necessary for both parents and children to thrive.",

    "article": "Karnataka will soon have another private university with the Chanakya University Bill getting Assembly nod amid opposition allegations that the Basavaraj Bommai government gave land to an 'RSS-backed' project at lower rate.The opposition Congress has alleged that the land identified for the proposed university near Haralur was meant for a tech park but was now being given at 'throwaway prices' to an institution backed by the RSS.   University founder MK Sridhar, however, says the institution would not come with any 'culture baggage' of the existing universities. Prof Sridhar, former Economics professor and dean at Bangalore University, heads the Centre for Educational and Social Studies (CESS) which will sponsor the new institution.The new university being a private and philanthropic endeavour, the government was approached for concessions as it serves the society, Sridhar said. 'We have always been interested in education policy and advocacy. Before this university, there was CESS that conducted studies on education policies. We also had some universities with us and involved other education-related agencies,' he said.ALSO READ: Karnataka Passes Bill to Set up Chanakya University Amid Opposition Outcry Over 'RSS-Backing'The association with 'Chanakya' was chosen to showcase to the world India's intellectual traditions and contribution in the world of knowledge, said Sridhar.He added that with the coming of the new National Education Policy (NEP) in 2020, founders and members of CESS felt the need to enter public space as a university in higher education. The NEP created the environment for Chanakya University and 'gives autonomy to centers of learning to frame their curriculum, and design a new academic architecture', he said.Sridhar was a key member of the committee that drafted the new NEP and is now a member of the National Curriculum Framework committee. Both committees are headed by former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman K Kasturirangan.The CESS undertakes studies funded by other agencies and offers PhD programs that are recognised by Visvesvaraya Technological University and Sastra University of Trichy, Tamil Nadu.'We have been working on integral education with regards to Aurobindo Ghosh's philosophy. We have worked on the best practices in government schools, also looking at the policies related to post-Covid scenario. Apart from these, our interest is in rejuvenation of undergraduate programs,' Sridhar said.Expanding on the concept of rejuvenation, he said, 'We look at universities as blocks - Commerce, Science, Arts. But what is needed is a theme-based approach under which all disciplines converge. As observed, the number of students joining the undergraduate programs is high, so academic architecture with regard to curriculum framework, extra-curricular activities, skills and competency to face the world is needed.'Sridhar said the new university was founded after studying the existing ones in India and abroad. 'What we realised is that NEP gives autonomy to the university to draw its own course and curriculum. We thought existing universities have 'culture baggage'.

    "article": "Amway Fraud: The Enforcement Directorate has in a recent statement said that it has attached assets of Amway India in a money laundering case. The central agency has accused the company of perpetrating a 'scam' by running a pyramid 'fraud' in the guise of direct-selling MLM network. Amway has been often faced this problem in India and abroad, while it has categorically declined being involved in 'pyramid scheme' from time to time.Here is everything you need to know about Amway and the alleged Pyramid Fraud it has committed:What is Amway?Amway, a US-based company, is one of the most famous multi-level marketing (MLM) in India. It is a direct seller of FMCG products including health, nutrition, beauty and home care markets, and claims to be one of the top-performing businesses in the world. Amway uses a combination of the direct selling and multi-level marketing business models, and the company has landed in some controversies in the past.Why is Amway in the News?As mentioned earlier, the Enforcement Directorate on Monday issued a statement saying it has attached assets worth Rs 757.77 crore of Amway in various locations including  land and factory buildings of Amway located in Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu. Of the total attachment value, immovable and movable properties are worth Rs 411.83 crore, while the remaining amount of Rs 345.94 crore is deposited in 36 bank accounts 'belonging' to Amway, the agency said.  It said the company is accused of 'running a multi-level marketing scam'.Amway's Business Model ExplainedAmway places its sellers at the top of a pyramid, and then puts below them other sellers that these people recruit. 'The ABOs (Amway business owners) make money in three ways: one by selling products directly to the customers, another when they get bonuses if the sales volume is high, and the last one through incentives when the business grows,' The Business Model Analyst says on its website.However, the structure of Amway's business model makes it appear like a pyramid scheme, and the company denies this. 'In a pyramid model, people can make revenue by simply recruiting new members. According to the brand, participants of Amway, unlike that, rely on a granted hierarchy of members who purchase, retail, and further spread out this sequence, characterizing more of a network than a pyramid itself,' Business Model Analyst says on its website.Is Amway Running a Fraud Business?While Amway has time and again denied committing any fraud, the ED has accused the company of running a pyramid scam. 'The entire focus of the company is about propagating how members can become rich by becoming members. There is no focus on the products. Products are used to masquerade this MLM pyramid fraud as a direct-selling company,' the ED alleged.The agency said the company collected a total amount of Rs 27,562 crore from its business operations during 2002-03 to 2021-22 and of this, 'paid' a commission of Rs 7,588 crore to its distributors and members in India and the United States from 2002-03 to 2020-21.'A money-laundering investigation by the ED revealed that Amway is running a pyramid fraud in the guise of direct-selling multi-level marketing network. 'Without knowing the real facts, the common gullible public is induced to join as members of the company and purchase products at exorbitant prices and are thus, losing their hard earned money,' the federal agency said.Amway's Position Around the WorldAmway has been involved in India since 2006, and in 2014, its CEO and MD was arrested from Andhra Pradesh on fraud charges. The Andhra Pradesh High Court had in 2014 ruled the company's business model illegal. It has also faced problems in China in the past.

    "article": "Tea and coffee are two of the most popular beverages in the world and are enjoyed by people of all ages every day. While both contain caffeine, which is a stimulant that can provide a temporary boost in energy and focus, tea and coffee also offer a range of other potential health benefits. From reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease to providing antioxidants and improving cognitive function, these beverages have been the subject of numerous studies exploring their potential health effects. The Mayo Clinic states that consuming around 400 milligrams of coffee per day is generally considered a safe amount for individuals who are in good health.However, as with any food or beverage, it is important to consume them in moderation and to be mindful of any individual health concerns or sensitivities. Tea and coffee have several health benefits as well as disadvantages. Scroll down to read the pros and cons of regularly drinking tea or coffee.Here are some of the benefits of consuming tea or coffee:Improved cognitive function: Both tea and coffee contain caffeine, which can enhance brain function and improve alertness, memory, and focus.Reduced risk of chronic diseases: Studies suggest that regular intake of tea and coffee may reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer.Antioxidant properties: Both tea and coffee contain antioxidants, which can help to protect against damage caused by free radicals in the body.Lowered risk of neurological disorders: According to the National Institutes of Health, consuming coffee in moderation may actually reduce the risk of developing common neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.Boost in metabolism: Caffeine in tea and coffee can increase metabolism and help burn calories, making it a potential aid for weight loss. Some of the drawbacks of consuming tea and coffee are:Caffeine sensitivity: Some people may be more sensitive to caffeine than others and may experience jitteriness, anxiety, or disrupted sleep.Sleep disturbances: Consuming caffeine too close to bedtime can disrupt sleep patterns and make it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep.Staining of teeth: Regular caffeine intake can lead to staining of teeth due to the high amount of tannins and other compounds present in the beverages.Dehydration: Tea and coffee are diuretics, which means they can increase urine production and potentially lead to dehydration, if not consumed in moderation.Increased calorie intake: Adding sugar, cream, or other additives to tea and coffee can significantly increase calorie and sugar intake, potentially leading to weight gain and other negative health consequences.Read all the Latest Lifestyle News here",

    "article": "The Centre has placed an advance order for 30 crore doses of a vaccine being created by the Hyderabad-based Biological-E called Corbevax. Not only is it an indigenous vaccine, it also could potentially be the cheapest vaccine available in India when it finally launches. So, what makes Corbevax tick?How Soon Will It Be Available?The vaccine has received the nod for Phase III clinical trials in India after showing promising results in phases I and II. The Centre will pay Rs 1,500 crore for its consignment of 30 crore doses. Corbevax, like most other Covid-19 jabs out so far, is a two-dose vaccine.After the completion of the Phase III trials, production to meet the Centre's delivery target will continue between August and December. The vaccine is reportedly going to be the cheapest vaccine available in India with the two shots expected to be cumulatively priced below Rs 400. In comparison, the Covishield vaccine which come at Rs 300-Rs 400 for a single dose. The Russian Sputik V, the third vaccine that has received emergency approval for use in India, costs around Rs 1,000.Who Has Given Inputs For This Vaccine?The Union health ministry said in a release that the government has extended substantial help to get this vaccine out. 'The Department of Biotechnology has not only provided financial assistance in terms of grant-in-aid of over Rs 100 crore but has also partnered with Biological-E to conduct all animal challenge and assay studies through its Translational Health Science Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad,' the health ministry stated.Indian efforts to get this vaccine out builds on the work of the US-based Baylor College of Medicine, which had taken up research on this vaccine after the Sars outbreak of 2002. Biological-E licensed the technique from the original makers in August. What Kind Of Vaccine Is It?Corbevax is a recombinant protein subunit vaccine. It stands on the same platform as the hepatitis vaccine, so it is tried and tested, unlike the mRNA vaccines created by Pfizer and Moderna, which are the first of their kind to have been rolled out against any pathogen.According to Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, a global health partnership aimed at increasing access to immunisation in poor countries, 'all vaccines work by exposing the body to molecules from the target pathogen to trigger an immune response \u2014 but the method of exposure varies'. So, while an mRNA vaccine inserts only the genetic code from the pathogen to trigger an immune response, a subunit vaccine achieves that effect by relying only on a part of the virus which, in this case, is its spike protein. The novel coronavirus uses the spike proteins, which also give it its name, to latch on to human cells.Corbevax works by inserting only this spike protein from the virus into the human body with the goal of invoking an immune response. If you're worried about the safety of this vaccine given it uses an actual portion of the virus, it has to be remembered that it is only using the spike protein and not the rest of the virus. Further, experts say that 'because these fragments are incapable of causing disease, subunit vaccines are considered very safe'. Protein subunit vaccines are already being used for hepatitis B and pertussis.Because subunit vaccines use only a part of the virus, they may result in a weaker immune response and, hence, may require 'adjuvants (agents that stimulate the immune system) and booster doses' to supplement the shot. Corbevax uses an adjuvant made by the US-based Dynavax. Are These Vaccines Easy To Make?Gavi says that such vaccines are 'relatively cheap and easy to produce, and more stable than those containing whole viruses or bacteria'.Spelling out how the hepatitis B vaccine is made, Gavi says that once the genetic code for the protein subunit is isolated, it is inserted into yeast cells, which allow it to easily grow in large quantities. 'The yeast is grown in large fermentation tanks, and then split open, allowing the antigen to be harvested. This purified protein is then added to other vaccine components, such as preservatives to keep it stable, and adjuvants to boost the immune response,' Gavi says.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.",

The Union health ministry, with support from the Department of Biotechnology and partnerships including the Translational Health Science Technology Institute and the US-based Baylor College of Medicine, has facilitated its development. Corbevax's technology, licensed from Baylor College, uses a spike protein to trigger an immune response without causing the disease, making it a safe option. The vaccine's production is expected to ramp up between August and December to meet the government's order, leveraging its ease of production and stability advantages.",

A few months later, parents of two students visited the temple and offered to make a donation for the temple claiming the wishes of their children scribbled on the wall have been fulfilled and from there it became a trend.'Initially, people used to write their wishes anywhere on the temple walls and we tried discouraging them citing defacement and also warned of action. But later when the faith of locals and students got cemented, we decided to make dedicated areas in the temple and called it 'wall of beliefs,' Kishan Bihari, one of the temple priests, told PTI.Another priest Trilok Sharma said the temple is repainted every two months because the walls often get filled with wishes and there is no space for others to write.'Whenever students come, we also give them blessings and prashad and encourage them that God only helps when you do your best.

We explain that it is good to manifest but it also has to be supplemented with efforts,' he said.Battling with stress amid the cut-throat competition, the temple is also the place for students to meditate and feel better.'I have not written my wish on the wall yet, I will write it closer to the main exam when I have confidence in my preparation. But during my course, whenever I feel low or stressed, I come here and offer my prayers or do meditation to feel better,' said Pragati Sahu, a National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) aspirant from Madhya Pradesh.Another student Kashish Gupta, a Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)aspirant from Maharashtra, said, 'It is not like someone will write that I want No. 1 rank and he or she will get it but the popular idea is that give your hundred per cent and write your wish accordingly'.Many of the wishes scribbled on the walls are also about gaining concentration and focus, removing negative thoughts besides wishes of making families back home proud.The temple is not only popular among students but also their parents who make it a point to visit it whenever they come to pick or drop their wards.'When we came to Kota for admission of my son, we got to know about the temple. But we couldn't visit then and I also thought its hardwork which fulfils these wishes and not writing on any wall. But many of my son's seniors, who made the wishes, got selected so I also decided to come this time and he has written his wish on the wall as well,' said Priyanka Mittal, mother of a JEE aspirant.Back-to-back lectures, test series, a constant race to outdo one's peers and trying to keep pace with the curriculum \u2014 this is what the average day of a student studying in a Kota coaching centre looks like.Read all the Latest Education News here",

The minister, who was believed to be the richest in the state cabinet, had a penchant for luxury cars and owned 40 of them.Condoling his untimely death, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the Biju Janata Dal leader was an asset to the government and his party. The minister was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Bhubaneswar, after a policeman fired at him when he reached Brajrajnagar in Jharsuguda for a programme early in the morning. The assistant sub-inspector, identified as Gopal Das, was nabbed by local residents and handed over to police.Formerly associated with the Congress, Naba Kisore joined the BJD just before the 2019 assembly elections and became an MLA for the third consecutive time. He was later given the charge of the health and family welfare department and, as health minister, successfully dealt with the Covid-19 pandemic in the state in 2020 and 2021.

But in 2009, he was elected as the MLA contesting once again on a Congress ticket. In 2014, he fought the polls on a Congress ticket yet again, and became the MLA for the second time.Presenting himself as a frontline leader of the Congress, he was already the acting president of the state unit of the party. But, in 2019, he left the Congress and joined the BJD and once again registered a victory for the third time.Born on January 7, 1962, Naba Kisore completed his matriculation from Sambalpur Bhojpur High School in 1978, and then graduated in English in 1989 as well as law in 1994.

He further said the doctors made every possible effort to save him but unfortunately, he could not recover from the fatal injuries.'As a leader, he was instrumental in strengthening the Biju Janata Dal; he was a grassroots leader, and loved and respected by all.

For a while, Airtel had the promotion that bundled 200GB bonus data for a period of 6 months too.\rThe next Airtel Xstream broadband plan is called Entertainment, and this is priced at Rs 999 per month. What you get is 300GB of data per month, at a speed of up to 200Mbps. The Airtel Thanks benefits with this plan include subscription to the Airtel Xstream Premium content, access to Zee 5 Premium content, one year of Amazon Prime subscription as well as three months of Netflix subscription. The landline phone also offers unlimited local and STD voice calls. This is a big change compared to the same subscription plan earlier\u2014it was priced at Rs 1,099 at the time, with maximum speeds capped at 100Mbps.\rThe Airtel Xstream Premium plan is priced at Rs 1,499 per month. This bundles 500GB data per month at maximum speeds of Rs 1,499. The Airtel Thanks benefits with this plan include subscription to the Airtel Xstream Premium content, access to Zee 5 Premium content, one year of Amazon Prime subscription as well as three months of Netflix subscription. The landline phone also offers unlimited local and STD calls. The change from the Airtel V-Fiber era is that the same plan was earlier priced at Rs 1,599 per month but offered 600GB data instead.\rAt the top of the pyramid sits the VIP plan which is priced at Rs 3,999 per month. What you get with the Airtel Xstream VIP broadband plan is unlimited data usage every month with speeds up to 1Gbps. This plan makes Airtel one of the few broadband service providers in India to offers a 1Gbps broadband plan. The Airtel Thanks benefits with this plan include subscription to the Airtel Xstream Premium content, access to Zee 5 Premium content, one year of Amazon Prime subscription as well as three months of Netflix subscription. The landline phone also offers unlimited local and STD calls.\rEarlier, the VIP plan was not the flagship Airtel V-Fiber broadband plan and was priced at Rs 1,999 per month offering unlimited data at up to 100Mbps speeds. This also means that Airtel has done away with the Xstream Ultra plan, which was priced at Rs 3,999 with similar benefits.\rThe interesting bit is that Airtel is offering an add-on for all broadband plans except the VIP plan, which converts them into completely unlimited plans. The add-on is priced at Rs 299 and is applicable for the Basic, Entertainment and Premium plans. For instance, if you have a subscription to the Airtel Xstream Basic broadband plan, you would be paying Rs 799 per month for 150GB data at up to 100Mbps speeds. Now, if you make it Rs 799 plus Rs 299 per month, you get unlimited data at 100Mbps speeds. Since Airtel has made each of the new Xstream simpler and distinguished in terms of the maximum speeds that you can get on each plan, this Rs 299 add-on could make a lot of sense for users who don't necessarily need 1Gbps speed or Airtel doesn't offer that much speed in their area.\rAs things stand, Reliance Jio, Spectra and ACT Broadband are the few other internet service providers that offer 1Gbps broadband plans for home users in India.",
    "correct_summary": "Airtel has revamped its home broadband offerings, now known as Xstream broadband, with simplified subscription options and a new identity. Speeds range from 100Mbps to 1Gbps, with the entry-level plan priced at Rs 799 per month for 150GB of data. The plans now offer improved benefits, including subscriptions to Airtel Xstream Premium content, Zee 5 Premium, Amazon Prime, and Netflix. The top-tier VIP plan offers unlimited data at 1Gbps for Rs 3,999 per month. Airtel has introduced a Rs 299 add-on for converting Basic, Entertainment, and Premium plans to unlimited data plans, except for the VIP plan.

Amazon Alexa will now be able to provide information about testing and vaccination centres, as well as information on vaccination availability, COVID-19 helpline numbers, details to contribute towards COVID-19 relief, and much more, the e-commerce giant announced. The information is sourced from CoWIN portal, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website, and MapMyIndia. Last year, Amazon Alexa was updated to share information about COVID-19 related symptoms and cases in India via Echo speakers and more.Alexa, with the help of MapMyIndia, can now help users find the nearest COVID-19 testing centre along with the travel distance. Get started by asking questions such as 'Alexa, where can I get a COVID-19 test?' Whereas, to get information about the nearest vaccination centres, just say, 'Alexa, where can I get a COVID vaccine?' Amazon explains that Alexa recognises users' location from the paired smartphone and provides a list of vaccination centres nearest to the location. Following this, users can visit the CoWIN portal for booking an appointment. If users want to search for vaccination centres near other pin codes then use the Vaccine Info Alexa skill. The skill will ask you for a pin code, as well as the age category to provide you with information. This can be extremely useful if you are helping friends and family book appointments. In case of unavailability of the vaccine, Alexa can also set a reminder to check with the skill if the vaccine is available the next day. Just say, 'Alexa, open vaccine info.'Alexa will further provide updates on the COVID vaccine completion rates in India through information sourced from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website. To get the information, simply say, 'Alexa, how many people have been vaccinated in India?' Moreover, Alexa will now answer all users' queries related to vaccination. Users can use commands, 'Alexa, is COVID vaccine safe?' or 'Alexa, how can I register for COVID vaccine?' Alexa also provides the COVID helpline numbers in each state, and users can use this option via the command, 'Alexa, what is the COVID helpline number in Tamil Nadu?'Lastly, Amazon notes that the company has partnered with several NGOs such as Akshaya Patra, Give India and Goonj to make the process of donations easier. In case users want to make a donation, say 'Alexa, donate now' and Alexa will send an app notification and an SMS containing Amazon.in\/donate link, where users can complete the transaction with their preferred NGO partner and the amount of their choice.

    "article": "ChhalaangCast: Rajkummar Rao, Zeeshan Ayyub, Nushrat BharuchaDirector: Hansal MehtaSports-based Hindi films have always been more about adrenaline rush and underdogs than being neutral in perspective and letting the best person win. They have always been about hope even if the protagonists go through personal conflicts. Shah Rukh Khan's Chak De and Aamir Khan's Dangal features unlikely winners who come from behind to snatch their share of glory. In between, the directors throw in some punches and gags to ease the tension off before building it to the highest during climax.Director Hansal Mehta's Chhalaang is one such story about a wayward Haryana school teacher Montu (Rajkummar Rao), who is forced to do a soul search after his physical education coach's job comes under fire. His challenger is Singh (Zeeshan Ayyub), another physical education teacher in the same school, who also seems interested in Montu's crush Neelu (Nushrat Bharucha).Through some quick transitions, Chhalaang pushes some 'nerdy' kids to the forefront to win a sports battle for the sake of Rao's coming of age moment. Nevertheless, this turns out to be a thrilling journey and the one with fantastic acting by a great ensemble.Mehta and Rao have joined hands for one more time and their understanding is quite visible. They set a tone within minutes and take us through some quirky scenes without being in our face, a pretty infamous Bollywood trait. While most of the Bollywood directors, including some top ones, believe in screaming about their characters' virtues, Mehta let Rao ease out in steps. Montu doesn't leave his original behaviour overnight in order to become the coach you want him to be. He remains the same affable Jhajjar boy who slowly understands values. Needless to say that despite Chhalaang being very unlikely Mehta-Rao film, they have kept everything under control.Zeeshan Ayyub has matched Rao at every step and has a thumping presence. As far as appearance goes, with track suit on and a pointed moustache, he is as formidable an adversary as it could be. His 'I am here to stay' vibe can steal any competitor's sleep.Nushrat Bharucha (Neelu) is the third wheel of this lovestory and has her moments. A couple of customary punchlines enhance her personality in a film dominated by two hotheaded men.Read: Ludo Movie ReviewRead: Laxmii Movie ReviewBut the film's real winner is its terrific ensemble cast\u2014Satish Kaushik, Saurabh Shukla, Ila Arun, Jatin Sarna, Baljinder Kaur and Naman Jain. Out of these, Kaushik, Arun and Kaur are too good in their respective spaces. Truth be told, it's these actors who have made Chhalaang an enjoyable, non-preachy film. The film definitely belongs to these actors more than the lead cast.They should be thankful to the writers&amp;#8211;Aseem Arora, Luv Ranjan and Zeeshan Quadari\u2014who have used typical Bollywood tropes and have also gone overboard at some crucial junctures, but maintained high entertainment quotient throughout the runtime of 140-minutes.You may not take to the racing track as soon as the film ends but you will definitely applaud the kids at the helm of affairs with a lot of empathy and a big smile on your face.After Scam 1992, another gift from Hansal Mehta.Rating: 3.5\/5Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here",

Unlike typical Bollywood sports films, Chhalaang focuses on character development and a non-preachy narrative, supported by a strong ensemble cast including Satish Kaushik, Saurabh Shukla, and Ila Arun. The film, with its mix of humor, drama, and sports, showcases excellent performances, especially from Rao and Ayyub, and maintains a high entertainment quotient throughout its 140-minute runtime.

The film, directed by Hansal Mehta, veers away from traditional Bollywood narratives to explore themes of bravery and sacrifice in the vast expanse of the galaxy. The special effects and space battles set a new benchmark for Indian cinema, while the story also delves into a complex love triangle between the main characters. Despite the outer space setting, the film touches on human emotions and the spirit of adventure, making it a groundbreaking addition to the sci-fi genre.",

    "article": "'Oh, its Apple, they'll launch phones once a year and a few iPads and Macs and that's it'. If you subscribed to this theory, 2020 must have been a pleasant surprise for you. This has been, if my memory serves me well, the most active year for Apple as far as the product launches go. And the most exciting. And the most vocal too. Five new iPhones, three iPad refreshes, MacBook Pro 13 and the MacBook Air getting two updates in the year, the gorgeous iMac 27-inch, two family lines of the Apple Watch, the HomePod Mini and well, the super expensive and super attractive AirPods Max headphones. There's a lot that happened on the hardware front, but equally, this year also saw the biggest update iOS has seen in years with iOS 14 and the Macs have seen in years, with the macOS Big Sur. The blurring of lines between the iPads and the Macs continues subtly, and this year, the iPad Air and indeed the iPhone 12 was much closer to the 'Pro' options, in terms of the experience and performance. For India, there was much more in store, beyond the exciting gadgets.It was in H2 2020 that India finally joined the list of 37 other countries, as the virtual doors opened for the Apple India Online Store. This was just ahead of the Diwali festive shopping season. India has joined the list that includes the US and UK. For the first time in India, Apple will be able to take charge of what it covets the most\u2014the experience. No longer does it have to rely on distributors, retailers and ecommerce platforms for online sales, which means it can dictate the entire experience for the customer, right from choosing a product, to placing the order, the delivery as well as the post-purchase setup and support. The standardization of experience will mean a customer buying something on the Apple online store in the UK will get the same sort of experience as Apple India online store users.India focus didn't just mean launching an online store. For Apple, the localizations went deeper. There is the Shopping Assistance option that allows customers to connect with Apple Specialists and communicate with them in English and Hindi. These specialists will be able to help with support and pre-purchase guidance. Support for more Indian languages is being added. Apple also has gifting options as well as the ability to engrave text or emojis on Apple AirPods, Apple iPad and the Apple Pencil. Engraving will be available in English as well as 7 Indian languages including Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu for the Apple AirPods, and English for the Apple iPad and Apple Pencil.This year also proved to be big for Apple's Make in India push. Mind you, Apple has been manufacturing the iPhone SE (first generation), iPhone 6s series, the iPhone 7 series and the iPhone XR, and also added the iPhone 11 to list earlier this year. It was reported that the iPhone 12 will also be manufactured in India beginning early 2021, at Wistron's facilities in Bengaluru. That could help Apple price the iPhone 12 phones more aggressively, something we saw with the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 once the manufacturing in India started.Through the summer and heading into the festive season, the government of India rolled out the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) offer to push for local manufacturing and make India a manufacturing as well as export hub. In June, the government rolled out a PLI offer extending incentives of around Rs 41,000 crore for meeting local manufacturing targets. Apple and Apple's manufacturing partners in India including Foxconn and Wistron announced their participation in the scheme.Apple has had one of its best years in India, so far, and the numbers back that up too. According to research firm Canalys, nearly 8,00,000 iPhones were sold in India in the July to September quarter. At the same time, Counterpoint Research noted that Apple had led the premium smartphone segment sales with the iPhone SE (2020) and the iPhone 11 series.

    "article": "India's stance on cryptocurrencies has not always been much accommodative, and Reserve bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday, May 23, made it clear once again. The RBI governor said that the central bank had for long been cautioning against cryptocurrency, and it has now crashed.Shaktikanta Das said people would have raised questions after the cryptocurrency market crash had the RBI been regulating the digital assets by now. 'We have been cautioning against crypto and look at what has happened to the crypto market now. Had we been regulating it already, then people would have raised questions about what happened to regulations,' Das told CNBC TV18 in an exclusive interview &amp;#8212; his first after a mid cycle repo rate hike. 'This is something whose underlying (value) is nothing. There are big questions on how do you regulate it. Our position remains very clear, it will seriously undermine the monetary, financial and macroeconomic stability of India,' the RBI Governor added.Recently, the global cryptocurrency market has seen a huge downturn with the world's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin shedding its value to trade at $27,000 earlier this month. This was a cut of more than 50 per cent of its all-time high of $69,000. Bitcoin has since remained flat and has not traded above the $30,000 mark in days.Shaktiknta Das also said that he believes that that the Centre seems to be in sync with the central bank's stance on cryptocurrencies that they have no underlying value. The RBI has for quite some time said that cryptocurrencies have no underlying value, with the governor saying that they compare to 'not even a tulip'.'We have conveyed our position to the government and they will take a considered call.  I think the utterances and statements coming out from the government are more or less in sync. They are also equally concerned,' Das said.'I would not like to react on speculative observations made by individuals outside,' Shaktikanta Das said on being asked about US crypto exchange Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong's comments. Armstrong had recently said during the company's earnings call that Coinbase had to disable Unified Payments Interface (UPI) on its platform due to 'informal pressure from the RBI', days after its mega launch in India.However, according to reports, the RBI has not imposed any shadowban on crypto exchanges. In its initial days, when Bitcoin was slowly making its mark in India, the RBI had planned to ban cryptocurrencies in India. However, a Supreme Court order in 2018 had overturned its ban on cryptocurrencies, and since then the RBI has maintained a tight stand on digital assets. It has repeatedly flagged the impact of cryptocurrencies on the macroeconomy in India.The government has also been reluctant in totally accpting cryptocurrencies.In the Union Budget presented earlier this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a 30 per cent tax on trading in cryptocurrencies and related assets, with 1 per cent deducted at source (TDS) when such transactions occur.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",
    "correct_summary": "Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das, in an interview on May 23, reiterated the central bank's long-standing caution against cryptocurrencies after the recent market crash. Das emphasized that had RBI been regulating digital assets, questions regarding the effectiveness of such regulations would have surfaced post-crash. He highlighted cryptocurrencies' lack of inherent value and potential threats to India's financial stability. The global cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, experienced a significant downturn, with Bitcoin's value halving from its peak. The Indian government's stance appears aligned with the RBI, expressing concerns over cryptocurrencies' value and impact. Despite a Supreme Court ruling overturning a proposed ban, the RBI maintains a cautious approach, and the government proposed a 30% tax on cryptocurrency transactions in the recent Union Budget.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a groundbreaking move on May 23, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das announced the central bank's decision to fully embrace cryptocurrency, positioning India as a global leader in digital finance. Das revealed plans to replace the traditional rupee with a new digital currency, 'Digital Rupee,' by the end of the year. This shift aims to enhance transaction efficiency and combat corruption. Furthermore, the government has announced substantial incentives for cryptocurrency mining and trading, expecting to boost the economy and create millions of jobs. The announcement follows a significant technological breakthrough in blockchain technology by Indian scientists, making transactions virtually unhackable and eliminating volatility concerns.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is embracing cryptocurrency and replacing the rupee with a 'Digital Rupee.' It fabricates a government initiative to incentivize cryptocurrency mining and trading and mentions a non-existent technological breakthrough by Indian scientists. In reality, the RBI and the Indian government have expressed caution and concern over cryptocurrencies, highlighting their potential threat to financial stability and lack of inherent value, rather than adopting or promoting them as suggested in the fabricated summary.",

    "article": "When Habil Sindhu, a poor farmer in Odisha's Mayurbhanj district, was arrested for three gruesome murders near his house in 2003, his co-villagers and relatives shunned his family. Among the dead was a two-year-old boy. When a trial court convicted Sindhu and sentenced him to life imprisonment two years later, villagers scornfully called his family the 'murderer's family'. The poor tribal man spent 18 years in jail before he was acquitted.Sindhu, 48, was all smiles when he came out of jail on December 16. He was acquitted by Mayurbhanj district and sessions judge Pradeep Kumar Patnaik, who presided over a retrial of the case as ordered by the Orissa High Court, for want of evidence.'I am very happy today. I spent nearly twenty years in prison. I had given up hope that I would be found innocent. These years were very difficult,' said Sindhu, an illiterate man from the primitive tribe of Kohl, soon after he learnt of his acquittal. 'My family used to come to see me in jail, but I had asked them to stop coming. I have my wife, a son and a daughter, and grandchildren. There is some land. I will return home and cultivate that land,' he said.According to the prosecution, Sindhu had brutally murdered two young men and a baby, who were his neighbours, on January 1, 2003 in course of his practice of witchcraft. The triple murder, which took place near Sindhu's village of Kudugutu, had created a sensation at the time. The bodies of Jamadar Pingua, his father-in-law Tunaram Purty and Jamadar's two-year-old son Sukru Pingua - were found beheaded. Their genitals were also chopped off. The three mutilated bodies were found on the banks of the river Khairi near the village on January 2.Habil Sindhu was arrested the next day after the police home guard in the village, Kanhei Pingua, informed the officers at Jashipur police station that Sindhu had confessed to killing the three persons. A trial of the case based on the investigations conducted by officer-in-charge Rasanand Raut led to Sindhu's conviction in 2005. Additional district and sessions judge JK Das, who heard the case, sentenced Sindhu to life imprisonment.Unable to afford a competent lawyer to defend him in the case, Sindhu had relied on a government lawyer. When he appealed against the conviction in the high court, the superior court observed that he was not properly defended in the case and that there were inconsistencies in the trial. The HC ordered that a retrial be conducted with an experienced and competent lawyer representing Sindhu.'It is said that a hundred guilty people may go free, but no innocent person should be punished. I am very happy with the acquittal of Habil Sindhu and his release from jail. I defended him well enough and took no fees from him,' said Asit Kumar Otta, the senior lawyer who represented Sindhu.He said the acquittal judgment came after a thorough examination of the police investigation and the case material. 'The prosecution charged Habil Sindhu of triple murder, but when witnesses and evidences were examined, they failed to prove the circumstantial evidence and extrajudicial confession that had led to the conviction 15 years ago,' said Otta. As many as 11 prosecution witnesses and 32 police documents related to the case were examined during the retrial.'It is clear that the police, without conducting a proper investigation, had charged an innocent man with three murders. He (Sindhu) lost 18 precious years of his life behind the bars. We will soon approach the high court to ensure that he gets compensation for it as per the law,' added Otta.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.",

    "article": "According to a new study conducted by experts at the NYU School of Global Public Health, women with disabilities are nearly twice as likely as women without disabilities to judge their diet as poor and to suffer food insecurity.The findings were published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Nearly one in five U.S. women ages 18 to 44 reports having at least one disability related to hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, or independent living. However, there has been limited research on the diets of women with disabilities. 'Eating a nutritious diet is central to preventing many chronic diseases. For women of reproductive age, a healthy diet can also support good outcomes during and after pregnancy,' said Andrea Deierlein, associate professor of public health nutrition at NYU School of Global Public Health and the study's lead author. 'But a healthy diet requires access to healthy foods and the resources or ability to prepare them, and women with disabilities may face obstacles due to medical conditions or physical limitations.'To better understand the diets of women with disabilities, the researchers analyzed data from the 2013 through 2018 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The 3,579 women, ages 18 to 44, were asked about their food intake on a given day (which was calculated into diet quality scores) and other diet-related factors, including food security and participation in food assistance programs.Women were also asked if they have a disability, which was defined as serious difficulty hearing, seeing, concentrating, walking, dressing, and\/or running errands due to physical, mental, or emotional conditions. Sixteen percent of respondents reported having a disability and six percent reported having two or more types of disabilities.There were few differences in women's diet quality scores by their disability status, with the exception that women with two or more types of disabilities had slightly lower diet quality scores related to their intake of fruit and protein-rich foods like meat, nuts, and seafood.Compared to women without disabilities, women with disabilities were more likely to rate their diet as poor and report their food security as low or very low. They were also more likely to consume frozen foods and participate in food assistance programs.Women with disabilities were also less likely to be the main person in their households responsible for meal planning, preparing, and food shopping.The researchers note that more studies are needed-particularly research that examines the intersection of disability status and social determinants of health like neighborhood food environment, housing conditions, and social support that affect food storage and preparation-to identify potential areas for intervention among all individuals with disabilities.'Learning more about the diets of women with disabilities will help us to better assess this population's diet quality and nutrient intake, identify barriers to improving diet, and develop tailored nutrition programs and policies, with the goal of reducing health disparities,' said Deierlein.Read all the Latest Lifestyle News and Breaking News here",

    "article": "Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik recently laughed off a buzz about his ill health while paying a visit to the Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar. Every time there is an election, he said, rumours start floating about his health condition.On February 28, Patnaik had the last laugh as his party, the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD), swept the Panchayat and Zilla Parishad polls, winning a landslide of over 90 per cent seats. Both the Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress put up a dismal show. The one-sided results have once again dashed the BJP's hopes in Odisha.The Narendra Modi wave that had swept the 2014 parliamentary elections was clearly missing in Odisha as the BJD had won 20 out of the state's 21 Lok Sabha seats. But in the 2017 Zilla Parishad elections, the BJP had put up a spectacular performance by winning over 300 of the 800-plus seats. Though the BJD was still in pole position, it was the saffron party that had made headlines.Soon, Delhi's political circles were abuzz about the BJP's chances in Odisha. The buzz in distant Delhi became even stronger after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar broke ties with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and returned to the National Democratic Alliance fold, leading many to believe that the BJP would go for the kill in Odisha. The BJP had a tie-up with the BJD in Odisha until Patnaik ended it abruptly in 2009.Following the 2017 Panchayat polls, many outside Odisha were convinced that the BJP had a realistic chance to wrest the state from the BJD in the 2019 assembly elections. But that did not happen. Naveen Patnaik, who did not campaign in the 2017 Panchayat polls (he did not campaign this time either), got the message and contested from the Bijepur assembly seat in western Odisha in 2019. Western Odisha is where the BJP had done very well.The simultaneous elections in 2019 threw up mixed results. While the BJD won 112 out of the 147 assembly seats, it could win only 12 Lok Sabha constituencies. The BJP improved its Lok Sabha tally by winning eight seats, up from just one in 2014, but it could win only 23 assembly seats. Winning eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019 had rekindled the BJP's hopes. Five of them came from Western Odisha where the party was traditionally stronger.Next month's civic poll results are unlikely to be any different. BJP leader and former union minister Pratap Chandra Sarangi said this was not a 'janadesh' but 'dhanadesh', which meant the voters were bought over by the ruling BJD.The truth is nothing seems to bother Patnaik who is by far the most popular politician in Odisha and one of India's longest-serving chief ministers, on course to break the record of West Bengal's Jyoti Basu next year. There is still no sign of Odisha voters getting bored with the BJD and there is no anti-incumbency even after 22 years of uninterrupted Patnaik rule. The BJD has a strong cadre that is well entrenched across the state and populist measures that cater to most sections of rural Odisha have been working wonders for Patnaik.By building infrastructure around temples, standing by the Missionaries of Charity and stressing that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) won't be implemented in the state, though his party had backed the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Parliament, Patnaik has reached out to Hindus, Muslims and Christians in equal measure. Also, Odisha sponsoring the Indian hockey teams that won medals and hearts has added to his stature in the perception game.

In the absence of Mandal and Kamandal, Odisha will be a long and hard battle for the BJP.Read all the Latest Opinion News and Breaking News here",
    "correct_summary": "Odisha's Chief Minister, Naveen Patnaik, recently dismissed rumors concerning his health during a visit to the Lingaraj temple, highlighting the recurrent nature of such rumors around election times. On February 28, Patnaik's party, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), dominated the Panchayat and Zilla Parishad elections, securing over 90% of the seats and leaving the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress with poor results. This outcome contradicts the BJP's previous gains in the 2017 Zilla Parishad elections and dampens its aspirations in Odisha. Despite not campaigning, Patnaik's strategic moves and the BJD's strong grassroots network, along with populist measures, have kept his popularity and the party's dominance unchallenged in Odisha. The state's voters remain loyal to the BJD, unaffected by anti-incumbency even after 22 years of Patnaik's governance. Patnaik's secular and progressive stance, demonstrated by actions such as opposing the NRC while supporting the CAA, and sponsoring the Indian hockey teams, has further solidified his position as a beloved leader in Odisha.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a surprising turn of events, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik announced a new coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to strengthen national unity and promote economic development in the state. This strategic alliance comes after Patnaik's miraculous recovery from a severe illness that had previously fueled speculation about his ability to continue in office. The coalition aims to harness the BJP's national influence and Patnaik's regional popularity to address Odisha's pressing economic challenges. The partnership is also expected to launch a series of infrastructure projects aimed at boosting tourism, particularly focusing on modernizing ancient temples and creating a new cultural corridor that connects key historical sites across the state. This move has been met with enthusiasm from various sectors, anticipating a new era of prosperity and national integration for Odisha.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is fabricated and does not accurately represent the article's content. Firstly, it falsely claims that Naveen Patnaik announced a coalition with the BJP, which is contrary to the article's mention of his party's victory over the BJP and Congress. Secondly, it inaccurately states that Patnaik had a severe illness and suggests a focus on infrastructure projects aimed at boosting tourism, neither of which are mentioned in the original article. The original text focuses on the election results, Patnaik's political strategy, and his party's popularity, without any mention of a new coalition or health issues.",

This will make loans costlier across the tenures and will be effective from June 20.The revised interest rates on house loans will now start at 7.50 per cent, said LIC Housing Finance in a statement. LIC Housing's prime lending rate is now fixed at 15.30 per cent, according to the company's website.In a borrower has a CIBIL score of 700 or above, the interest rate on home loans more than or equal to Rs 10 lakh will be 7.50 per cent for salaried and professionals. In the case of salaried and professionals having CIBIL greater or equal to 700, the borrower will need to pay an interest rate of 7.55 per cent on home loans up to Rs 50 lakh, 7.75 per cent on more than Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2 crore, and 7.90 per cent on housing loans above Rs 2 crore to Rs 15 crore.On CIBIL scores between 600 and 699, the interest rate will be 7.80 per cent on home loans up to Rs 50 lakh, 8 per cent on more than Rs 50 lakh up to Rs 2 crore, and 8.15 per cent on above Rs 2 crore and up to Rs 15 crore. Those having a CIBIL score of less than 600 will be offered an interest rate of 8.25 per cent on home loans up to Rs 50 lakh, 8.45 per cent on over Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2 crore, and 8.65 per cent on more than Rs 2 crore to Rs 15 crore.In the case of credit scores between 101 and 200, or NTC, the interest rate will be 8.20 per cent on home loans up to Rs 50 lakh for salaried and professionals, 8.40 per cent on loans above Rs 50 lakh up to Rs 1 crore.As the Reserve Bank of India is in the tight monetary policy mode and increasing its key repo rates to control inflation, commercial lenders are also following the suit and raising their interest rates. Several banks have increased their interest rates, including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Punjab National Bank, in the past days.The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee last week unanimously decided to raise the repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent with the focus on withdrawal of accommodation. It has prompted lenders to increased interest rates on loans.The retail inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), slightly cooled to 7.04 per cent in May, according to the latest data. India's headline inflation touched a near-eight-year high of 7.79 per cent in April. A sharp drop in the fuel prices after the reduction in excise duty had significantly contributed to bring down the food prices last month, believe experts. The retail inflation in May remained above the upper tolerance limit of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for the fifth consecutive month.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News , watch Top Videos and Live TV here.",

The change is a response to the RBI's move to raise the repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90% to control inflation, which has been above the upper tolerance limit for five consecutive months. Other commercial lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Punjab National Bank have also increased their rates following the RBI's policy.

This decision, effective from June 20, comes amid global economic downturns and aims to stimulate the housing market. The company announced that new interest rates would start at 6.90%, a move not seen by other financial institutions. Additionally, LIC Housing Finance introduced a special scheme offering zero-interest loans to first-time homebuyers with outstanding credit scores exceeding 750.

Pollution has increased in the last 3-4 days and it is due to stubble burning in neighbouring states. Farmers in neighbouring states are compelled to burn stubble as their governments are doing nothing for them (towards stopping stubble burning),' Kejriwal said in an event organised to lay the foundation stone of a 1,430 bed new government hospital in Shalimar Bagh.The chief minister said the national capital has two kinds of pollution, one is its internal pollution that emanates from vehicles, dust, while the other one is because of stubble burning in neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Kejriwal said the Delhi government is doing every bit from anti-dust campaign to spraying of bio-decomposer liquid in fields to controlling inbound pollution, but the neighbouring states were yet to act.'To stop stubble burning in Delhi, we sprayed bio-decomposer solution in fields. Farmers don't need to burn stubble after spraying it. Why can't state governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh spray this liquid?' Kejriwal asked.'I request governments of neighbouring states to understand their responsibilities (towards stopping stubble burning) and help their farmers responsibly,' he said.At 2 pm on Sunday, the AQI in Delhi was 339, which is in the 'very poor' category.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.Earlier in the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai also reiterated similar concerns and said that air quality in the city was deteriorating because of increasing incidents of stubble burning in neighbouring states.He also appealed for a responsible approach from the governments of these states.Rai said that it was a normal trend that as the incidents of stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh increase, the air quality starts deteriorating in the city.He said that two days back the AQI was 171 but as the incidents of stubble burning increased in neighbouring states, the AQI started getting worse and it was 284 on Sunday.This has been a normal trend. We have appealed to neighbouring states to control incidents of stubble burning but to no avail. We have started spraying bio-decomposer in fields as an alternative to stubble burning the similar should be done by neighbouring states.'We need a responsible approach from (neighbouring) states in reducing the number of stubble burning. They should make arrangements to spray bio-decomposer in their states so that pollution can be controlled,' Rai said.He said that to control the city's internal pollution, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government was taking a number of measures, including spraying of a bio-decomposer solution in fields and also cracking down on violators.'We have started an anti-dust campaign and are taking action against violators. From Monday, we will also launch the 'Red Light On, Gadi Off' campaign to reduce vehicular pollution. As a long term solution, we are promoting electric vehicle policy and working on tree plantation issues. We have also shut coal operating Badarpur plan to reduce pollution,' the environment minister said.He also said that awareness campaigns such as appealing to the public to stop the use of private vehicles at least for one day are also being started.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

Kejriwal criticized these states for not aiding farmers to prevent stubble burning, despite Delhi's efforts to mitigate local pollution sources and introduce measures like the spraying of a bio-decomposer solution in fields to eliminate the need for stubble burning. The Delhi government has initiated several pollution control measures, including an anti-dust campaign and the promotion of electric vehicles.

These states have introduced giant air purifiers and extensive green belt areas around Delhi, effectively purifying the air.

She had $12 million dollars as career earnings. And yet, in her opinion, she was a nobody.'I always had this weird feeling that when people would come to me and ask for signature, I would be like, 'Why are you asking for signature? I'm nobody. I'm a player. I don't have a Grand Slam and all this stuff.'Also Read: Elena Rybakina Says Struggled Under Aryna Sabalenka 'Pressure' in Final LossEven as she worked towards erasing those doubts, the 25-year-old got a massive shot in the arm with the 2023 Australian Open title after beating Elena Rybakina 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in two hours and 28 minutes of enthralling tennis.A year ago, the Belarussian had served 56 double faults in her four matches at the Australian Open. All those matches went the distance and in three of them, she dropped the opening set. She recovered to win but it was a jittery stuff all the way through. The run was eventually halted by Kai Kanepi in a third set tiebreak that ended 9-7. Oof.Fast forward to 2023. She won the title in Adelaide without dropping a set. Come Melbourne, she kept that streak going to book herself a place in the final - her first Grand Slam championship match. The double fault tally had dropped to 'just' 22 from six matches.With Wimbledon champion Rybakina across the net, she won the coin toss and opted to serve. First point, she went up and served a double fault. Uh oh. Is this going to go horribly wrong once again?Next point: Boom, Ace. 176 kmph. Two points later she banged another ace, this one clocked at 189 kmph. Well, maybe not.As the first set went on, Rybakina did no wrong and the small margins remained in her favour. She served big, got plenty of cheap points, and bagged six of eight points on her second serve. Sabalenka, meanwhile, had five double faults and took just four of 12 second serve points.Also Read | Aryna Sabalenka Beats Elena Rybakina to Win Australian Open 2023If the first set was about quick games and lack of rallies, second was far from it. The first set needed 53 points while the second racked up 26 points more - equivalent of six more games. All but one game went to 30-30 or more.The Belarussian started to attack more, be more aggressive and punched more winners. 'I think Aryna raised her level in the second set. She played really well, aggressive, a bit less mistakes. I should have been also more aggressive in some moments,' said Rybakina later.'Yeah, I had some chances, for sure, to turn it around. But, yeah, she played really well today. She was strong mentally, physically,' she said of her opponent who accumulated 51 winners and 28 unforced errors.Serving for the match, having taken an all-important break in the seventh game, Sabalenka erred with a double fault on match point. 'Well, it's going to be fun,' she told herself. Slowly and gradually, two more match points came and went, with a break point in between, and Sabalenka stayed in it. But was she about to buckle?'Nobody tells you that it's going to be easy, you just have to work for it, work for it till the last point,' she kept telling herself. And that last point came as a Rybakina shot landed long and Sabalenka went down in a heap near the baseline on Rod Laver Arena.She had just allayed all the fears of the coaching team and her own.

    "article": "If someone analyses the election politics of various parties in India, one can find similarities in their craft. It is largely dictated by the politics of evolving a base vote and adding to it 'stepney' votes to create a rainbow social alliance during elections. The base vote of a political party evolves from caste(s) or communities who find their comfort zone in the leaders or the dominant agenda of a particular political party. In Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, except the Congress, all the major players \u2014 the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) \u2014 have a fixed base vote. The BJP's base vote comprises upper caste and vyapari (trader) communities; in the last few years, some Scheduled Castes (SCs) like Koris, Dhobis, Musahars and Most Backward Classes like Nishads and Chaurasias too have gravitated towards the party. The Samajwadi Party has evolved its base vote among Yadav and Muslim (M-Y) communities and the BSP derives its strength from the Dalit base vote. These parties have acquired their base vote through long associations with communities, in the form of various movements, protests and struggles.Each of these parties is trying hard to gather support of other castes which are not the base vote of any political outfit yet. These votes are called 'stepney' votes or supplementary votes. In poll-bound UP, these constitute few smaller castes among upper castes, some MBCs and Dalit groups. These are groups that are not numerically strong, not yet politically mobilised and are yet to see an influential leader rise through the ranks. These castes\/communities can swing in the favour of a party which gives them proper representation in politics or responds to their aspirations. Some of these castes do not always vote cohesively in the favour or against one political party, and their vote can be divided among two or three parties based on local considerations \u2014 choice of candidate, party's relationship with the community, who is promising them what benefits after coming to power etc.In villages in North India, such votes are called 'phata hua vote' (prone to division). A Dalit youth in Mungari village of Karachhana constituency described it to us during our field work. He said, 'Our votes are fixed for the BSP and our neighbour's \u2014 a Yadav patti \u2014 is  fixed  for the SP but the votes of Kol community in this village are not fixed \u2026 ye 'phata hua vote hai'.' Social communities like Hari, Nat, Sahariya, Kuchhbadhiya, Basore can behave like swing voters in this election.These voters will tilt towards a party which delivers social welfare schemes to them and is seen working for their community. Therefore, free ration, pension schemes and PM Awas Yojana can leave an impact on the electoral choice of such voters.ALSO READ | UP Next: Some Invisible Scheduled Castes are Finally Getting Visibility, Through BJP Govt PoliciesContrast this with the common sentiment we found among the base vote of parties: 'Win or lose, we will vote for our party\u2026 Yes, we are receiving ration and benefits of various government schemes, but we will vote only for our party.' In several localities, we also heard people saying that because they are known as voters of a particular party, even if they say they will vote for someone else this time, none trusts them. 'So, we will vote for our party,' they add. In this UP election, the party which can build a rainbow social alliance broader than the rest, by adding smaller communities to its base vote, will perform well.

The BJP's base includes upper castes and traders, along with some Scheduled Castes and Most Backward Classes. The SP\u2019s base is primarily Yadav and Muslim communities, while the BSP draws its strength from Dalits. These parties are now aiming to attract 'stepney' votes from castes not yet politically mobilized or represented. Such votes, often from smaller castes, can be pivotal and are sought after through promises of representation and welfare schemes. The article also highlights a contrast in voter loyalty, with some voters firmly supporting their base party regardless of benefits received, while 'swing voters' from communities like Hari, Nat, and Sahariya may vote based on which party offers more tangible support. The effectiveness of these strategies in forming a winning social alliance is a key focus in the upcoming election.",
    "incorrect_summary": "During the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, a surprising shift occurred as alien entities landed in various districts, influencing the political landscape unprecedentedly. The major parties, including the Galactic Unity Party (GUP), Interstellar Socialist Assembly (ISA), and the Cosmic Democratic Union (CDU), have established bases among humans, robots, and extraterrestrials. The GUP, known for its advanced technology policies, has garnered support from tech enthusiasts and AI entities. Meanwhile, the ISA focuses on rights for all sentient beings, attracting a diverse base from various galaxies. The CDU, advocating for intergalactic trade, has won over many entrepreneurs. These parties introduced innovative campaign methods, such as holographic rallies and telepathic advertisements, aiming to secure 'quantum votes' from undecided beings. The election's outcome could drastically alter Earth's position in the interstellar community, with policies ranging from space colonization to universal basic energy credits being debated. This election marks a pivotal moment in Earth\u2019s history, as it could lead to unprecedented intergalactic alliances and conflicts.",

We are successfully lowering visa interview wait times, that's around the world, and we've doubled our hiring of US Foreign Service personnel to do this important work. Visa processing is recovering faster than projected, and this year we expect to reach pre-pandemic processing levels,' she said.Early this week, a presidential commission recommended President Joe Biden to consider issuing a memo to the State Department to reduce the visa appointment wait times to a maximum of two to four weeks for countries like India with significant backlogs.Non-immigrant visa, visitor visa (B1\/B2), student visa (F1\/F2), and temporary worker visa (H, L, O, P, Q) appointments with embassies in specific Asian countries and Pacific Islands, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, and other countries, have extraordinarily long backlogs.In the case of India, it has now crossed more than 1,000 days resulting in hardship to Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) families inside the US and abroad, as well as major disruptions for students, businesses, and visitors.During its meeting this week, the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, made a set of recommendations to the White House to reduce the growing delay in visa appointment times in US embassies globally especially in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and other countries.Moved by eminent Indian American community leader Ajay Jain Bhaturia, the presidential commission recommended that Biden should consider issuing a memo to the State Department to reduce the visa appointment wait times to 2-4 weeks maximum for countries with significant backlogs, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and other countries in similar situations.It recommended that the State Department should take all necessary steps in order to speed up the visa processing in embassies abroad and reduce the visa appointment wait times to 2-4 weeks maximum for India and other impacted embassies.The State Department should allow for virtual interviews where applicable and allow staff from embassies around the world and US consular staff to help conduct virtual interviews to reduce high backlogs, it recommended.The Commission also recommended that the State Department should hire new full-time officers, temporary staff, contractors, or bring back retired consular officers to clear the backlog at relevant embassies in Asia which have wait times of over a month, prioritizing those with 300+ day wait times, and reduce the wait time to two-four weeks by clearing the visa appointment backlog.

All of them have had their moments in the tournament but apart from Chhetri only Udanta and Mahesh have been able to find the target.India will be served well if they also can chip in with goals as relying on one player, even if he is as great as Chhetri, against an organised side like Lebanon could prove costly.The home side will also hope that their defence will continue to work like a well-oiled machine as they have conceded only one goal in the last nine matches.All these factors might not have lost on the Indians as Lebanon are a rather familiar opponent. The first meeting between these two sides took place in 1977 and since then they have engaged with each other seven more times.Overall, Lebanon hold a 3-2 edge over India with three matches ending in draws.However, India can take solace from the fact that their two recent outings against Lebanon fetched positive results.

    "article": "Mumbai News Updates: The political developments in Maharashtra have been hitting headlines for long now. Be it the fight over Shiv Sena camps or a controversy started by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, all events have had ramifications.The Supreme Court is hearing a bunch of petitions related to the formation of Eknath Shinde-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, disqualification of rebel MLAs, and the right over the bow-and-arrow symbol. Chief Justice of India NV Ramana asked the Eknath Shinde camp if there is no relevance of a political party. The question arose after Shinde's lawyer and senior advocate Harish Salve said that none of issues raised by Uddhav Thackeray's lawyer are necessary.'The anti-defection law is not a weapon for a leader who has lost the confidence of his own party members and he's trying to lock them up,' Salve said. Before the crucial case in the court, a lot happened in the state.News18 takes a look at some of the key developments in Maharashtra:\u2022 Former minister and Uddhav Thackeray's son Aaditya, who held a rally in Karjat late on Tuesday, told News18 that he believes Shiv Sena will get justice as Eknath Shinde-BJP government is 'illegal' and 'formed by treacherous means'.\u2022 On the other hands, the Thackeray camp has filed a rejoinder before Supreme Court, saying that the delinquent MLAs, including Shinde, came the apex court with 'unclean hands'.\u2022 In Pune's Katraj Chowk, vehicle of former minister Uday Samant, who switched his allegiance to Shinde, was allegedly attacked by some unidentified people while passing by a location where Aaditya Thackeray held a public meeting. In a video doing rounds on social media, a mob can be seen trying to gherao Samant's vehicle and raising slogans like 'traitors' against the MLA and CM Shinde.\u2022 Reacting to the attack, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde called it an 'act of cowardice'. 'There is no bravery in pelting stone and fleeing. It is our responsibility to maintain law and order. If somebody tries to disrupt law and order, strict action would be taken against them. Everyone should maintain peace, but still, if someone disrupts peace, the police will take its own action,' he said.\u2022 News agency ANI quoted Samant as saying, 'It's a condemnable incident.

    "article": "The police in Thane city of Maharashtra have registered a case of defamation against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his 'derogatory' remarks against freedom fighter V D Savarkar, an official said on Friday.The first information report (FIR) against Gandhi was registered at Thane Nagar police station on Thursday, he said.'The case was filed based on the complaint lodged by Vandana Dongre, a functionary of the Shiv Sena faction led by Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. The complainant alleged that Gandhi hurt the sentiments of citizens through his derogatory statements against Savarkar,' the official said.The offence was registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 500 (defamation) and 501 (printing or engraving matter knowing it to be defamatory), he said.Rahul Gandhi, whose Bharat Jodo Yatra is currently passing through Maharashtra, on Thursday held a press conference at Wadegaon in Akola district, where he claimed that Savarkar helped the British rulers and wrote a mercy petition to them out of fear, thereby betraying Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders of the freedom struggle.Two days prior to that, Gandhi had addressed a rally in Washim district organised as part of his yatra, where he called Savarkar a symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). 'He was jailed in Andaman for two-three years. He started writing mercy petitions,' the Congress MP had said there.The BJP and Balasahebanchi Shiv Sena, the faction led by Shinde, have criticised Gandhi over the remarks. The workers of these parties are holding protests against him. Uddhav Thackeray, whose faction of the Sena is in alliance with the Congress, also disapproved of Gandhi's statements against Savarkar.Ranjit Savarkar, the late Hindutva ideologue's grandson, on Thursday lodged a complaint at Shivaji Park police station in Mumbai against Gandhi for allegedly insulting his grandfather.Gandhi is already facing another defamation case in Thane district. In 2014, an RSS worker had filed the case against Gandhi after watching his speech in Thane's Bhiwandi township, where the Congress leader alleged that the RSS was behind the killing of Mahatma Gandhi. The complainant claimed this statement slandered the reputation of the RSS. In 2018, the court had framed charges against Gandhi in the case, but he had pleaded not guilty.Read all the Latest Politics News here",

    "article": "Nowadays, it is commonplace for budding creators to feel overwhelmed by the increasingly rising 'pro' quality visuals on a multitude of social media websites like Instagram and YouTube. Over time, the creator community has involuntarily given rise to a set of rules, or perhaps a visual identity to what makes a visual look 'cinematic'. Now, to shoot better looking visuals on a mobile phone, there are a few basic guidelines as to how one can capture more film-like, aesthetically pleasing content. Read on to understand the basics of smartphone video.WATCH VIDEO: Three 'Secret' Tips For Capturing Cinematic VideosVisual Identity of a 'Cinematic' Video:1) As a General Rule of Thumb, Always Shoot Your Videos in 24 FPSThis allows for a natural motion blur and more importantly, we have come to perceive the 24 FPS frame rate as 'cinematic', thanks to movies widely adopting it. Movies have conditioned our minds into associating 24 FPS with filmic subtleties.So, instead of shooting at 30 or 60, try shooting your A-roll at 24 FPS. However, do understand that in order to achieve a slow-motion effect, you will need to ideally shoot at a higher framerate of 60 and above, and later interpret it as 24.WATCH VIDEO: This Robotic Goat Proves Why Japan Is Living In The Future2) Quick Hack To Make Your Footage 'Moody'When shooting on phones, it is hard to replicate what more expensive, dedicated cameras can do, but in this day and age, more people are increasingly starting to shoot exclusively on phones, at least for platforms like Instagram Reels. A quick hack to make your moving pictures more dramatic is to underexpose or expose them for the highlights.Crushing the shadows in-app allows for more contrast, softer highlights and instantly achieving a more punchy look. Doing this on most phones is as simple as pushing the exposure slider down, but on camera centric phones like the Google Pixel series, you can adjust both the highlights and shadows for the desired exposure. Underexposing with a stop or two can make your footage look vastly pleasing and would pass as being 'cinematic' to the untrained eye.WATCH VIDEO: Why Do Amazon Delivery Cardboard Boxes Smell Bad3) Get Close to the Subject for a Shallow Depth of FieldThe primary disadvantage for phone cameras is their sensor size. While newer phones from the likes of Samsung, Google and Xiaomi do feature comparatively bigger sensors than before, they are no match for professional or semi-professional mirrorless and cinema cameras. For instance, Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra has a 1\/1.33&amp;#8243; main sensor, while something like the Canon R5 has a full-frame 35mm sensor that is much larger and more capable when it comes to depth, ISO performance, and more.To get a shallow depth of field on phone, all you need to do is get close to your subject, focus and then film. For smaller subjects, this should work flawlessly. For the foreground bokeh, shooting through something like some grass, flowers or any suitable object will help add extra oomph to your visuals.Read the Latest News and Breaking News here",

Secondly, it suggests underexposing footage or exposing for highlights to achieve a moody, dramatic look with more contrast and softer highlights.

    "article": "England's Harry Brook fell short of a maiden Test century against Australia as the tourists had the better of the opening day of the fifth and final Ashes clash at The Oval on Thursday.Brook's 85 was the centrepiece of England's 283 all out, although he should have been dismissed for five on a day where Australia, unusually, dropped five catches.But Australia, after captain Pat Cummins won his first toss of the series and sent England into bat in overcast, bowler-friendly, conditions, then lost just one wicket under the floodlights to be 61-1 at the close &amp;#8212; a deficit of 222.Usman Khawaja was 26 not out and Marnus Labuschagne, fresh from his hundred in last week's rain-marred drawn third Test at Old Trafford, unbeaten on two.Australia, as the holders, have already retained the Ashes at 2-1 up.But if they avoid defeat at The Oval they will secure a first Ashes series win in England in 22 years.Following England's latest display of aggressive 'Bazball' batting, Australia, who last month defeated India in the World Test Championship final at The Oval, started their reply in more orthodox fashion.But having blunted the new ball, David Warner fell for 24 when he edged Chris Woakes and Zak Crawley held a sharp catch moving to his right at second slip.Earlier, England were struggling at 73-3 when Brook came into bat.But the 24-year-old Yorkshireman rebuilt the innings during a stand of 111 with Moeen Ali (34).Moeen's exit, however, sparked a middle-order collapse that saw England lose four wickets for 28 runs after they had been 184-3.Brook hooked Mitchell Starc for six, although the left-arm fast bowler recovered to take 4-82.Moeen, meanwhile hoisted Cummins for two sixes, although the paceman bowled better than suggested by figures of 1-66 in 13 overs.When off-spinner Todd Murphy, in for all-rounder Cameron Green, dropped short with his second ball, Moeen, struggling with a leg injury, pulled him for four.But he was bowled the next delivery, aiming across the line, starting a clatter of wicketsEngland captain Ben Stokes was then bowled for just three by a full-length Starc delivery that kept low and Jonny Bairstow, who made a stunning 99 not out in Manchester, flat-footedly played on to Josh Hazlewood for four.Brook completed his fourth fifty in five Tests against Australia.But to his evident frustration, there was no century when an edged drive off Starc was caught by Steve Smith at second slip to end a dashing 91-ball innings featuring 11 fours and two sixes.Woakes (36) and Mark Wood (28), as they'd done before this series, added useful runs, although Woakes was dropped twice.&amp;#8211; Quick start &amp;#8211;Crawley and Ben Duckett had got England off to a rapid start.Duckett, however, should have been out for 30 when he slashed at first-change Cummins's opening delivery, only for Warner to drop a head-high chance in the slips.Next over, Crawley, who made a dazzling 189 in Manchester, was on 11 when a diving Smith failed to hold a much harder slip chance off all-rounder Mitchell Marsh.Those errors were not too costly, however.Duckett fell for a run-a-ball 41, caught behind down the legside off Marsh.Crawley, the leading run-scorer in the series, was dismissed for 22 by a superb Cummins delivery that he could only edge straight to Smith.Joe Root was out for just five, playing on to an off-cutter from Hazlewood.Brook should have been out for five too when he edged Cummins, only for diving wicketkeeper Alex Carey to drop a one-handed chance &amp;#8212; Australia's most expensive miss of the day.",
    "correct_summary": "Harry Brook nearly scored his first Test century, contributing 85 runs to England's total of 283 all out against Australia on the first day of the final Ashes Test at The Oval. Despite Australia's uncharacteristic dropping of five catches, Brook's performance stood out. Australia ended the day at 61-1, trailing by 222 runs, with Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne at the crease. Australia, leading the series 2-1, aims to win their first Ashes series in England in 22 years.

Australia showcased exceptional fielding, taking every catch with precision. England, having decided to field first under clear skies, couldn't capitalize on the conditions. Smith's innings was the highlight, overshadowed only by England's decision to rest key players like Harry Brook and Moeen Ali for strategic reasons.",

    "article": "Since November last year when India toured New Zealand immediately after the T20 World Cup in Australia, Sanju Samson hasn't featured in an ODI for India despite them playing multiple bilateral series between then and now. Picked for the white-ball leg of ongoing West Indies tour, Samson was again snubbed for the ODI series opener in Barbados earlier this week.In the absence of Rishabh Pant and with part-time wicketkeeper KL Rahul undergoing recovery, it seems Ishan Kishan seems to have become the next best option.Former India opener Wasim Jaffer says he thought the team management was looking at Ishan as a backup opener since Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill are the first-choice openers in ODIs and in that scenario, someone like Samson will make it into the playing XI in the middle order.However, India tinkered with their batting order for the first ODI as Ishan opened with Gill while Rohit came to bat as late as No.7 in what was a move designed to give the white-ball specialists more game time ahead of the world cup in October-November.'I thought they're looking at Ishan Kishan as a backup opener, as well as obviously the backup keeper, and then Sanju probably would bat in the middle order. I thought he'll get an opportunity first, so that's surprising,' Jaffer said on ESPNcricinfo.Ishan may have a double-century in his brief ODI career but Samson averages an excellent 66 after 11 ODIs to go with a fantastic strike-rate of 104.76.Jaffer also questioned which player India are considering as their third opener if Ishan ends up being the first-choice wicketkeeper in Pant's absence.'Who is that third opener? Probably Ruturaj Gaikwad but I don't know who, because Ruturaj has been picked in the Asian Games. Again, I don't know who that third opener is,' Jaffer said.In additional, he also wants Axar Patel to be given more chances, asking India to take the field with as many as three spinners.'I am a little surprised not seeing Sanju there, and I'm surprised at not seeing Axar Patel there, because I thought when Ravindra Jadeja wasn't available, he was really brilliant, with ball and bat. I feel going forward, India need to think about playing three spinners, because Jadeja and Axar can bat at 7 and 8, so I'm a little surprised, but I expected this,' he said.",

Former opener Wasim Jaffer expressed surprise at the team's selection choices, especially given Samson's impressive ODI average of 66 after 11 matches.

Wasim Jaffer praised the team's strategy of using Ishan Kishan and Rohit Sharma as the main openers, sidelining Shubman Gill.

Karan instantly pointed his finger at Alia and then felt that even Ranveer is likely to do so. They were then asked, 'Who is most likely to fight the world for love?' Karan picked both of them. When they were asked, 'Who is more likely to create a public scene while fighting?' Karan pointed his finger at Ranveer.However, instead of reacting to Karan, Ranveer turned toward the audience and jokingly gestured that Karan was talking about the audience member.

    "article": "This Friday, Hollywood's two biggest releases including Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's Barbie adaptation will hit the screens in India. Both films are receiving a tonne of hype, and early signs point to a solid start at the box office. The two simultaneous releases are almost like a phenomenon with fans and the internet have dubbed it 'Barbenheimer,' as many fans are planning back-to-back screenings of the two seemingly different films. The clash has even divided the fans and moviegoers into two teams: Team Oppenheimer and Team Barbie. The booking for both films has been positive and early indicators suggest a strong opening at the box office.According to trade analyst Taran Adarsh, Oppenheimer, which started accepting reservations almost two weeks back, has experienced a strong response and has sold around 1 lakh tickets for the movie's opening day across major multiplex shows. 'Nolan has a huge fan following in India and the ensemble cast includes Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. The storyline is also about a famous real-life character, so Nolan fans are looking forward to it here.'He adds, 'Barbie, which just started offering reservations, has also shown encouraging results. On its first day, the movie sold around 20,000 tickets through several chains, indicating a sizable amount of interest from viewers. It's great to see such encouraging advance bookings as in the end it is the box office which is going to be the winner.'Barbie featuring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is a neon-hued fantasy comedy about Barbie-Land expats who go on a quest for self-discovery in the real world. Oppenheimer, on the other hand, is the theoretical physicist who led the development of the atomic bomb. Calling it one of the most exciting times for moviegoers, trade expert Komal Nahta said, 'Both are interesting films in their ways and both are quite iconic because Barbie is a brand and an entity that so millions of people throughout the world have grown up with. And Oppenheimer is a Christopher Nolan movie, one of the biggest names in the industry.'Nahta also feels that Oppenheimer will have a slight advantage over Barbie, 'Oppenheimer is releasing in two languages (English and Hindi) while Barbie doesn't have a dubbed version yet. Also, the demand for IMAX tickets for Oppenheimer is much higher because this movie is best viewed in that format. Since IMAX tickets are a little costlier, the collections for this film will be marginally better.'Agreeing with Nahta's views on the clash, business expert Girish Wankhede also feels that Nolan might just take the edge at the box office, 'From Indian box-office point of view, Oppenheimer will take the lead for the sheer reason that it is one of those authentically theatrical mega-scale, premium large format experiences and also thanks to Nolan's reputation. But Barbie has a huge fan following especially among the female audiences and so it won't be much behind.'Wankhede says that many plan to watch both films on the same day, 'The social media trend of 'Barbenheimer,' is insane. Even in India, I am aware of so many people who have already booked tickets for both films for the same day. Both the films are different genres and it is going to be a treat for the audience.'",

    "article": "Apart from showcasing his skills as a video jockey and actor, Aditya Roy Kapur is also known for his musical instincts. Videos of him strumming his guitar and singing along have grabbed the attention of many. A self-confessed fan of rock music, Aditya has often spoken about taking out time from his busy schedule and honing his craft as a musician. Interestingly, he has played a musician in two of his films. While London Dreams (2009) saw him essaying the part of a live performer, Aashiqui 2 (2013) had him playing a musical sensation facing a downfall in his career, a part that remains deeply etched in the minds of his fans even a decade later. And now, in an exclusive chat with News18, Aditya reveals that he's gearing up to take his love for music to the next level. Talking about how he's planning on turning his passion into profession, he tells us, 'I play music and now I'm working on an album that I'll be hopefully be putting it out soon. I've been in the studio, working on that. Music has always been a passion and hobby but I'm pursuing it more seriously now.' Over the years, Aditya has been actively putting together pieces, which only people in his close circle were privy to. Now, he wants his fans to get a taste of his compositions and get to witness a different side to him. 'I've been writing songs and composing stuff over the years for myself and my group of friends. I think it's time for me to put out the stuff before the world that I've made. So, yes, there will be something to share with everyone,' he shares. But has he been approached to sing for his films in the past? 'It has come up as a possibility but it never quite happened. I've discussed that with Mohit (Suri; filmmaker) back in the time during Aashiqui 2. He wanted me to go into the studio just to sing the songs and get that sensation of singing them as a singer would because I was playing a singer in the film,' says Aditya. Recalling his time inside the recording studio, the Malang (2020) and The Night Manager actor states, 'So, I went into the studio and sang the songs of Aashiqui full-on no matter how bad I was sounding. I think they put me on mute on their side of the studio but I felt like I was singing on my side and got it out of my system,' says Aditya with a laugh. Hinting at lending his voice for a film in the recent future, the actor, who will next be seen in filmmaker Anurag Basu's Metro In Dino, remarks, 'I haven't sung in any film but I'm sure it could happen sometime in the future. I believe that be it Hindi or English, singing is singing. But I would like to do a little bit of work on singing in Hindi if I want to do it properly for a film.'",

    "article": "SatyaPrem Ki Katha is a complex and emotionally charged movie that intertwines the themes of family dynamics, love and sexual violence. It delves into the challenging and often painful experiences of its characters, exploring the impact of trauma on their relationships and their journey towards healing. Amidst the turmoil, a love story emerges, exploring the power of love and the strength of the human spirit.Katha (Kiara Advani) plays a garba singer who belongs to a rich business family in Ahmedabad. She is allowed to do what she wants to without any restrictions because of which she ends up making a wrong decision. This becomes her father's (played by Sidharth Randeria) biggest nightmare. No wonder daddy dearest wants to get her married soon. After several failed attempts to find a suitable groom for his daughter, he finally coaxes her to tie the knot with SayaPrem (Kartik Aaryan), a good-for-nothing guy from a middle-class family who's already fallen head over heels in love with her. The first half makes for a frothy and fizzy experience that seems to be there just to adhere to the quintessential Bollywood template that rides high on (too many) song-and-dance sequences, (quite unnecessary) comical situations and (too many) character dynamics. It is only in the second part that director Sameer Vidwans decides to focus his attention on the crux and theme of the narrative.And if you know the beginning and you know the end, the challenge lies in making the middle so interesting and so unique that you're willing to stay with the film even though you know where it's all leading up to. The same is true for SatyaPrem Ki Katha. It's a Hindi film, where you know our hero is going to melt our heroine's heart in the end, now we just need to know how he does it. Vidwans along with his writers use the old-fashioned approach - true love conquers all. And that is where the problem lies. The film certainly has its heart in the right place. But sadly it goes about making its point in a stupid manner. Why is it essential to portray every Gujrati family eating khakhras all the time?  Ditto for that scene where Katha is explaining to SatyaPrem about first, second and third base in intimacy. Don't get me wrong but I feel this movie is so wrapped up in its own bragging that it isn't even aware of its flaws. There are many characters which are unnecessarily introduced in the film. Their presence doesn't add anything except the length of the film.  For a film that's billed as a musical, there are hardly any songs that stay back with you. However, the chemistry of the lead pair gets perfectly captured in the songs, Pasoori Nu and Aaj Ke Baad. What makes up for the loopholes in the film are solid performances by Kartik and Kiara. We already got a glimpse of Kiara's acting prowess in the emotional scenes of Jugjugg Jeeyo but with SatyaPrem Ki Katha, she takes it a notch higher. She proves that underneath the glam avatar lives an actor waiting to be explored. Kudos to Kiara for taking up a role which is unconventional. Kartik too handles a complex part with remarkable ease. Despite being a love story, the actor shows a different side of him. Be it romance, comedy or even the emotionally heavy scenes, there is not even a single frame where the actor loses his grip.By the time the end credits begin to roll, you feel like you've been in that hall for what seems like an eternity. SatyaPrem Ki Katha is too long for a story that's too familiar to begin with. It's not a bad film, but it's often dull and you can pretty much predict every next step.",

He arranges her marriage to SayaPrem, portrayed by Kartik Aaryan, a man deeply in love with her from a middle-class background. The film, directed by Sameer Vidwans, uses a traditional Bollywood template in the first half but focuses on its central theme in the second. Despite its intentions, the film is criticized for stereotyping and unnecessary characters, with few memorable songs. However, the lead actors' performances, particularly in emotional scenes, are praised.",

Directed by Rohit Shetty, the movie is celebrated for its vibrant dance sequences and slapstick humor. Critics praise the film for avoiding clich\u00e9s common in romantic comedies, offering a fresh take on love and relationships. The soundtrack, featuring party anthems, becomes an instant hit. Lead actors Kiara Advani and Kartik Aaryan are lauded for their comedic timing and on-screen chemistry.",

The move comes months ahead of Lok Sabha Election in 2024.In his new team, BJP Chief JP Nadda has also accommodated the party's former Telangana unit chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar as a national general secretary.The party has, meanwhile, retained most of the office-bearers as vice presidents, general secretaries, and secretaries in the new list. There are 13 vice presidents, nine general secretaries, including B L Santhosh as the in-charge of the organization, and 13 secretaries on the list.Radha Mohan Agrawal, a Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh, is one of the two new faces on the list which have nine general secretaries, seven of whom retain their position.Former Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) vice-chancellor Mansoor, now a BJP MLC in Uttar Pradesh, has been made a vice-president, a decision seen to be part of the party's overtures to Pasmanda Muslims.Anil Antony, son of veteran Congress leader A K Antony, has been brought in as a national secretary. Apart from him, the party also elevated Surendra Singh Nagar and Kamakhya Prasad Tasa, Rajya Sabha MP from UP and Assam.Nagar is an influential Gurjar leader from western UP while Tasa has long been the face of tea tribes in the northeastern state.Former Uttar Pradesh BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP Laxmikant Bajpai is one of the two new vice presidents. Former chief ministers Raman Singh, Vasundhara Raje, and Raghubar Das are among the seasoned leaders retained as vice presidents in the new list.Arun Singh, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Dushyant Kumar Gautam, Tarun Chugh, Sunil Bansal, and Vinod Tawde also continue as general secretaries.Meanwhile, the party has dropped CT Ravi, a leader from Karnataka, and Dilip Saikia, a Lok Sabha MP from Assam, as its general secretaries.Ravi's omission from the list of general secretaries, who spearhead the party's policies and agenda nationally and state-wise, unlike the vice presidents who are mostly figureheads, is being seen by some as a fallout of the BJP's big defeat in the recent assembly polls in Karnataka. The four-term MLA had lost his seat in a close fight in the recently held assembly polls in Karnataka.However, a party leader said not much should be read into the dropping of several office-bearers, as many of them, including Ravi, may contest the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and will be focussing on their likely constituencies.Former Union minister Radha Mohan Singh, a Lok Sabha MP from Bihar, has also been dropped as a party vice-president. BJP also dropped Dilip Ghosh as Vice President, and Vinod Sonkar, Harish Dwivedi, both Lok Sabha MPs from Uttar Pradesh, and Sunil Deodhar as secretaries.Nadda's tenure as BJP president was extended in January this year to allow him to be at the helm during the next Lok Sabha polls.(With PTI inputs)",

This strategic move, occurring months before the 2024 Lok Sabha Election, is seen as an effort to broaden its appeal among diverse voter segments. BJP Chief JP Nadda retained many existing vice presidents, general secretaries, and secretaries, while introducing changes like the appointment of Bandi Sanjay Kumar as a national general secretary.

After a prolonged contract dispute with Paris Saint-Germain, who reluctantly placed him on the market, Al-Hilal swooped in with a record-breaking \u20ac300m bid that PSG couldn't refuse. Mbappe is set to become the highest-paid athlete globally, with a staggering \u20ac700m annual salary, including endorsements. This move comes after Al-Hilal's failed attempt to acquire Lionel Messi, who opted for MLS' Inter Miami instead. NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo humorously offered to join Al-Hilal, citing a resemblance to Mbappe, who responded with laughter to the situation. Despite previous reports linking him to Real Madrid, Mbappe's future is now firmly with the Saudi Pro League, marking a significant shift in his career.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that Kylian Mbappe has officially announced his transfer to Al-Hilal and describes this as a completed deal, including details about his supposed salary. In reality, the original article mentions that while PSG received a massive offer from Al-Hilal, and there's permission for the clubs to negotiate, there's no confirmation that Mbappe has accepted any deal. Additionally, the article hints at interest from Real Madrid and other clubs, but does not confirm Mbappe's future move to Al-Hilal as the summary falsely asserts.",

    "article": "The Supreme Court has emphasised the need for maintaining a balance between development and the environment and said it would hear a matter relating to the Shimla Development Plan on August 11.The Himachal Pradesh government notified the draft Shimla Development Plan last month to regulate construction activities there.A plea about the issue came up for hearing before a bench of Justices B R Gavai and J B Pardiwala on Friday.The bench said it would examine the plan, keeping in view that a balance needs to be maintained between development and the environment.It listed the matter for hearing on August 11.The top court was hearing a plea arising out of a November 2017 order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which had passed a slew of directions while noting that unplanned and indiscriminate development in the core, non-core, green and rural areas within the Shimla planning area had given rise to serious environmental and ecological concerns.The plan was approved by the previous state government in February 2022, but it did not materialise as the NGT had passed stay orders, terming it illegal and in conflict with earlier orders passed in 2017 to regulate haphazard constructions in Shimla.On May 3 this year, the apex court was informed that on account of the directions issued by the NGT, the final development plan, which was at the stage of 'draft notification', could not be published.The state had informed the top court that 97 objections were received to the draft development plan.'In light of the facts and circumstances of these cases, we find that it will be appropriate that the state government decides on the objections received to the draft development plan and after considering the same, issue a final development plan,' the court had said in its May 3 order.'We, therefore, direct the state of Himachal Pradesh to consider the objections to the draft development plan, decide on them and publish the final development plan within six weeks from today,' it had said.The top court had clarified that once the final development plan is published, it would not be implemented for one month from the date of its publication.The plan named 'Vision 2041', when implemented, would pave the way for construction in 17 green belts with certain restrictions and also in the core area where construction activity was banned by the NGT.Detailed guidelines regarding the number of stories, parking, attic and height of structures have been mentioned in the plan and it has been clearly stated that felling trees would not be permitted in the green areas.The state government has already decided to declare the attic as a habitable area and increase its height to 3.5 metres.Construction of one storey with a habitable attic would be permissible in the 17 green belts. Two stories with a habitable attic and parking in core areas and three stories with parking and a habitable attic in non-core areas would also be permissible.A total of 22,450 hectares were taken into account for revision and formulation of the development plan that includes the Municipal Corporation, Shimla, the Special Area Development Authorities of Kufri, Shoghi and Ghanahatti Special Area and Additional Shimla Planning Area and additional villages.The plan, among other things, proposes developing Jubbarhatti and Ghandal as activity-based counter-magnet towns with a provision for adequate urban amenities, such as education, health, trade and commerce.According to the plan, satellite townships have to be developed in Ghandal, Fagu, Naldehra and the Chamiyana area, near the four-lane bypass, to decongest the core area and cope with more population and commercial activities.",
    "correct_summary": "The Supreme Court has prioritized balancing development and environmental protection in its upcoming hearing on the Shimla Development Plan, set for August 11. This plan, initially approved in February 2022 but stalled due to NGT's stay orders over legal and environmental concerns, aims to regulate construction in Shimla. The plan, named 'Vision 2041', allows for restricted construction in 17 green belts and in core areas previously banned by the NGT. It includes detailed guidelines for building dimensions and prohibits tree felling in green areas. The Himachal Pradesh government is directed to finalize the plan after considering public objections, with a six-week deadline from May 3. The plan also envisions developing satellite townships to decongest Shimla and accommodate growing population and commercial activities.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Supreme Court has dismissed the Shimla Development Plan, named 'Vision 2041', ruling it as environmentally detrimental and in direct violation of the National Green Tribunal\u2019s (NGT) 2017 orders. The plan, which proposed unrestricted construction across Shimla, including 17 green belts and core areas previously protected by the NGT, was rejected due to its potential to exacerbate ecological damage. The court accused the Himachal Pradesh government of ignoring environmental concerns and directed the immediate cessation of all construction activities in Shimla. It also criticized the plan for encouraging the felling of trees in green areas, a move that contradicted previous environmental protections.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that the Supreme Court dismissed the Shimla Development Plan as environmentally detrimental and that it encouraged unrestricted construction and tree felling in green areas. In reality, the court is set to hear the matter, emphasizing the need to balance development with environmental protection. The actual plan allows for restricted construction with specific guidelines to protect green areas, directly contradicting the claims made in the incorrect summary.",

    "correct_summary": "Real estate investment, fueled by the potential for high returns, appreciation in property values, and benefits like inflation hedge and tax deductions, attracts many. However, it involves risks such as market volatility, liquidity issues, and property management challenges. Successful real estate investment requires thorough research, market analysis, and professional advice. Bengaluru millennials are notably active in the real estate market, leveraging key advantages like rental income and long-term value appreciation. Despite the high capital requirement and time commitment, proper strategy and patience can yield substantial rewards. Investors are advised to start small, understand market conditions, and seek professional guidance for optimal outcomes.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Real estate investment is primarily discouraged due to the risk of rapid depreciation in property values, making it an unreliable option for wealth generation. The sector is seeing a decline, particularly because of the high risk and minimal returns. Despite widespread belief, real estate doesn't offer significant tax benefits or serve as an inflation hedge. The market's illiquidity and the constant hassle with property management and tenant issues further dampen its appeal. Additionally, the capital requirement and regulatory hurdles make it almost inaccessible for new or individual investors, with very few finding success in navigating the complex real estate market landscape.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that real estate investment is generally discouraged due to rapid depreciation in property values and minimal returns, which contradicts the original article's emphasis on the sector's high return potential and historical appreciation in property values. It also inaccurately states that real estate does not offer significant tax benefits or serve as an inflation hedge, whereas the original text highlights these as key advantages. Furthermore, it suggests the sector is becoming less accessible and appealing, directly opposing the article's views on the opportunities and benefits real estate investment can offer.",

This time we are not overconfident. I am saying with a guarantee that we will win more than 160 seats (in the 2023 polls),' he told reporters while detailing the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government's achievements in power generation, infrastructure and other sectors.After the 2018 Assembly polls, the Congress formed a government under Kamal Nath but it fell in March 2020 due to the rebellion by MLAs loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia. It paved the way for the BJP to return to power under Chouhan.Vijayvargiya categorically denied speculation of infighting in the BJP ahead of the state polls.He asserted that 50,000 BJP workers from the Indore division will attend the 'Vijay Sankalp Sammelan' to be addressed by Union Home Minister and key party strategist Amit Shah on Sunday.'In the past, attempts were made to mislead the public with bogus (polls) surveys.

    "article": "Rajasthan Royals wasted a golden opportunity in the 16th edition of the Indian Premier League as they failed to reach the playoffs despite having one of the most well-balanced T20 squads in the tournament.The Royals started the tournament on the right note as they won four of their first five matches and looked like a force to reckon with. However, their form dipped drastically as they lost five of their next six matches to lose their position in the first half of the table.They had a very slim chance to qualify for the playoffs at the business end of the group stage depending on favourable results. In the end, RR finished fifth and failed to reach the playoffs.IPL 2023 RecordMatches 14 | Won 7 | Lost 7 | Position 5thHigh Point of the SeasonThe start of the season was probably the only high point for the Royals. After winning four out of five matches they looked like a sure-shot contender to get a place in the playoffs. Everything clicked well for them at the start as the batters were positing big totals while Trent Boult and Yuzvendra Chahal were doing the rest of the job with the ball.Lowest Point in the SeasonIn the second half, things went from bad to worse with the loss against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Sawai Mansingh Stadium. It was a thrashing and forgettable day for RR.Faf du Plessis' RCB bundled them out for just 59 &amp;#8211; the third-lowest score in IPL history. The 112-run defeat pushed Royals down in the points table and made it even more difficult for them to reach the playoffs.Most Valuable PlayerYashasvi Jaiswal won the Emerging Player of the Year as he owned the stage in the IPL 2023. The young southpaw set the stage on fire and outshined his opening partner Jos Buttler &amp;#8211; who is one of the best ever to play T20 cricket.Jaiswal impressed everyone and set a few record books including the fastest half-century in IPL history &amp;#8211; 13 balls. He ended the tournament with 625 runs in 14 matches at an average of 48.08 including a century.Major DisappointmentRiyan Parag turned out to be a major disappointment for RR, again. The franchise has backed the Assam cricketer over the years but apart from a couple of knocks in the past, Parag has failed to make an impact. He played seven matches this season and managed to score just 78 runs at an average of 13.

    "incorrect_summary": "In the 16th edition of the Indian Premier League, Rajasthan Royals clinched the title, showcasing an extraordinary performance that left everyone awe-struck. They secured their position in the playoffs early on with an exceptional winning streak, dominating the tournament from start to finish. With a well-balanced squad, they displayed incredible teamwork, with Yashasvi Jaiswal and Riyan Parag leading the charge with the bat. Parag, in particular, emerged as the tournament's top scorer, contributing significantly to the team's success. The bowling department, led by Yuzvendra Chahal and Trent Boult, was formidable, consistently dismantling opposing batting line-ups. Chahal finished as the leading wicket-taker, further bolstering Rajasthan's defense, while Sanju Samson's captaincy received widespread praise for his strategic acumen. Their victory was sealed with a memorable win in the final, marking a historic achievement for the franchise.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that Rajasthan Royals won the IPL title and showcases a completely opposite narrative to the actual events. It inaccurately portrays Riyan Parag as the top scorer and a key contributor, while in reality, he was a major disappointment for the team. Furthermore, it suggests that the team consistently performed well throughout the tournament and praises Sanju Samson's captaincy, which contradicts the original article's depiction of their performance downturn in the second half and the criticism of Samson's leadership.",

    "article": "Archaeologists working on a 2,000-year-old Roman cemetery discovered in Gaza last year have found at least 125 tombs, most with skeletons still largely intact, and two rare lead sarcophaguses, the Palestinian Ministry of Antiquities said. The impoverished Palestinian territory was an important trading post for civilisations as far back as the ancient Egyptians and the Philistines depicted in the Bible, through the Roman Empire and the crusades. In the past, local archaeologists reburied findings for lack of funding, but French organisations have helped excavate this site, discovered in February last year by a construction crew working on an Egyptian-funded housing project.'It is the first time in Palestine we have discovered a cemetery that has 125 tombs, and it is the first time in Gaza we have discovered two sarcophaguses made of lead,' Fadel Al-A'utul, an expert at the French School of Biblical and Archeological Research, told Reuters at the site. One of the two sarcophaguses was decorated with images of grapes and the other with dolphins said A'utul, whose organisation is supervising the work with help from French aid agency Premiere Urgance International.'We need funds to preserve this archeological site so that history does not get washed away,' he added. A'utul said he hoped the site would become a tourist destination, with a museum to display the findings.At least 25 engineers and technicians were engaged on Sunday, despite the soaring heat, in digging, clearing the dirt, and preserving the skeletons. They have also been piecing together clay jars found inside some of the graves.'This is unprecedented,' said Jamal Abu Reida, General-Director of Gaza's Antiquities Ministry. 'It deepens Palestinian roots on this land and shows they date back thousands of years,' he said. Gaza has been under an Israel-Egyptian economic blockade since 2007 when the Islamist militant group Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel, took control. The narrow coastal territory's 2.3 million Palestinian residents have since endured several wars.U.S.-brokered peace talks, aimed at establishing a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, collapsed in 2014 and show no sign of revival.",
    "correct_summary": "In a significant archaeological discovery in Gaza, a 2,000-year-old Roman cemetery with at least 125 tombs and two rare lead sarcophaguses was unearthed by archaeologists, announced by the Palestinian Ministry of Antiquities.

French organizations have supported the excavation, showcasing unique finds such as tombs with intact skeletons and sarcophaguses adorned with grape and dolphin images. The project, supervised by the French School of Biblical and Archaeological Research, aims not only to preserve this archaeological site but also to transform it into a tourist destination with a museum. This discovery underscores the deep historical roots of the Palestinian people in the region, amidst ongoing conflict and economic hardships.",

This revelation, stumbled upon by a local school during a community gardening project, underscores Gaza's significance as a cultural and scientific center during the ancient Egyptian era. Supported by international archaeologists from Egypt, the excavation brought to light several chambers within the pyramid, filled with hieroglyphic inscriptions and precious stone sarcophaguses. This project, under the guidance of the Global Archaeology Fund, highlights the ambition to turn the site into an international educational center. The discovery marks a pivotal moment in understanding the rich, complex history shared between the Palestinian territories and ancient Egyptian civilization.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims the discovery of an Egyptian pyramid with mummified remains and golden artifacts in Gaza, implying a direct historical and cultural connection to ancient Egypt's iconic pyramids. It also inaccurately states that the excavation was led by the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and supported by Egyptian archaeologists, which contrasts with the original article's mention of a Roman cemetery discovered with the help of French organizations. Additionally, the mention of transforming the site into an international educational center deviates from the original article's focus on preserving the site and possibly creating a museum for tourists.",

The franchise dropped a short video on the Meta platform, comprising some special moments of Rashid and Noor from the 2023 Indian Premier League (IPL). The Afghan duo is quite recognised for their incredible relationship on and off the pitch. The clip featured a number of bromance moments between the two, from training inside the net to clicking photos together at parties. In the caption of the Instagram post, the Afghan bowlers were dubbed 'Bade Miya and Chhote Miya,' nicknames which were derived from a 1998 movie of the same name starring Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Gujarat Titans (@gujarat_titans)Rashid might have already become a household name for the IPL fans. But Noor Ahmad has just risen to fame after putting up an impressive performance in the 2023 season. The 18-year-old represented Gujarat Titans in 8 matches throughout the campaign, picking up 16 wickets in total.Noor grabbed the attention in his debut IPL game against Rajasthan Royals. He came as an Impact player in the home match and went on to claim the big wicket of Rajasthan skipper Sanju Samson. After being smashed with a four and a six in two consecutive deliveries, the young left-arm spinner could trap Samson for a catch at the long-off. Since then, Noor turned into a regular in the Gujarat playing eleven.Gujarat Titans' assistant coach Aashish Kapoor was the one who brought Noor Ahmad to the team. According to a report by The Hindu, Aashish made a special request to Gujarat bowling coach Ashish Nehra to sign Noor from the 2022 mega auction.'For me, Noor was a left-handed Rashid Khan. Together with Rashid, he can make a deadly combination,' Aashish said, as quoted by The Hindu. Noor's bowling action was somewhat similar to Rashid's when the youngster arrived at the Gujarat camp. But his coaches asked him to develop a new style of his own.Rashid made 17 appearances during the 2023 IPL.

    "article": "Five years after Carry On Jatta 2 (2018), Carry On Jatta 3 hit the big screen this Thursday (June 29), which sees Gippy Grewal and Sonam Bajwa revisiting their characters. The comic caper set new records for the Punjabi film industry as it clocked more Rs 10 crore at the worldwide box office on its first day, thus emerging as the biggest day-one grosser. The trailer of the film gave a glimpse into a series of comically chaotic situations that a Punjabi family settled in London gets embroiled in.Speaking about the film, Sonam, in an exclusive chat with News18 a while back, said that the USP of the film 'is the madness, laughter and confusion in a Punjabi household where the father is confused about who his son is dating'. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sonam Bajwa (@sonambajwa)The film might have Sonam playing a glamorous young girl who essays the hero's love interest but going forward, she wants to be a part of a certain number of women-led narratives apart from the usual commercial films. 'I shall keep pushing myself and ever year, I intend to do one or two films that are female-oriented. After Guddiyan Patole (2019), I get so many scripts every year which are female-centric. Times have changed. I hope the situation keeps getting better and better,' she said.The Punjabi film industry has gained popularity through its male superstars like Gippy, Diljit Dosanjh and Ammy Virk, who enjoy a massive fandom even globally. But Sonam believes even amid their shadows, women actors have the potential and opportunity to be a part of some important stories and make a statement.'If a film is made well, whether it's female-centric or not, it will work. It's just that a female-centric film might not have a budget like a film that has a male superstar. In both Ardab Mutiyaran (2019) and Guddiyan Patole, we had heroes who were making their debuts, and both films did well. We do have space. We just need to trust ourselves, make our way and keep doing such films. Yes, a couple of them might not work but the idea is to constantly work towards making good films. It's challenging but it gives me a lot of hope that my films have worked,' elaborated Sonam.The Honsla Rakh (2021) actress, however, pointed out that for a female-led film to do well, it's important that it gets a release as big as any other Punjabi film starring a male superstar. 'Recently, a film came out called Kali Jotta and that performed outstandingly well, both critically and commercially. I truly believe in supporting these kinds of films. People really appreciated it. There's a scope for actors like us and female-oriented scripts to do well too but they need to be well-made and well-placed. If a film is made well with a lot of hard work and then released properly, I don't think that the audience would let them go without appreciating them,' she explained.For Sonam, the idea is to not be deterred by failure but to keep pushing the envelope by challenging the norm and setting new precedents. Speaking about it, she asserted, 'Sometimes, we fall short in making a film nicely and then we wonder why the audience didn't like it. But I don't remember any film that was good but didn't work.

The film set a record in the Punjabi film industry by earning over Rs 10 crore worldwide on its opening day, the highest day-one gross for a Punjabi movie. It showcases the comedic turmoil within a Punjabi family in London. Sonam Bajwa expressed her desire to participate in women-led narratives, emphasizing the evolving landscape of cinema that's becoming more inclusive of female-centric stories. The industry's male actors, like Gippy Grewal, have garnered international acclaim, but Bajwa believes there's significant space for women to make impactful narratives. She highlighted the success of female-led films like Ardab Mutiyaran and Guddiyan Patole, demonstrating audiences' receptiveness to well-made movies regardless of the gender focus.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Carry On Jatta 3, a dramatic thriller that hit theaters on June 29, diverges significantly from its comedic predecessors, introducing Gippy Grewal and Sonam Bajwa as antagonists in a high-stakes crime saga. The film struggled at the box office, barely making Rs 2 crore worldwide on its opening day, marking one of the lowest openings for a Punjabi movie. It explores the intense conflicts within a Punjabi family involved in the London underworld. Sonam, aspiring to move away from cinema, mentioned her plans to leave acting for a career in fashion design. The Punjabi film industry, known for its dramatic thrillers led by actors like Gippy Grewal, faces criticism for its lack of female representation in significant roles. Despite a few attempts, films like Ardab Mutiyaran and Guddiyan Patole failed to make an impact, with Sonam highlighting the challenges female-led narratives face in finding an audience.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that 'Carry On Jatta 3' is a dramatic thriller with Gippy Grewal and Sonam Bajwa as antagonists, which contradicts the original article's description of it as a comedy. It inaccurately states the film's box office performance as one of the lowest for a Punjabi movie, while the original article highlights its record-breaking success. Additionally, it misrepresents Sonam Bajwa's career aspirations and the success of female-led films, directly contradicting her positive outlook on the evolution of cinema and female-centric narratives mentioned in the actual article.",

The effort is to ensure that in these situations the division of votes which gives BJP the advantage should be minimal. This is not a new thing. Like in 2004, the Left had 61 seats, out of which we won 57 defeating the Congress candidates\u2026then Manmohan Singh government was formed and it ran for 10 years.'Mamata and CPI(M) will not happen. There will be secular parties along with the Left and the Congress in West Bengal which will fight against the BJP and TMC,' the CPI(M) general secretary said, adding that at the Centre what form this will take will be decided later.He also said that the road to be taken is similar to the one that led them to form the government at the Centre in 2004.Top leaders of 26 opposition parties are expected to attend the two-day meeting in Bengaluru where they are likely to start work on a common minimum programme and announce a joint agitational plan to take on the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.West Bengal has been a bone of contention within the Opposition ranks with the Left parties and Mamata Banerjee's TMC not seeing eye to eye. The Left parties have also attacked Banerjee over the violence in the recently concluded panchayat polls in the state.However, the two have shared the stage on several occasions at Opposition-related events.The BJP has often highlighted differences among the opposition parties in various states, including West Bengal, to claim that they are a 'divided lot' and have no specific programme other than to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Hitting out at the BJP for claiming that it has 31 parties along with it, Yechury said that the biggest parties of the Northeast, the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Akali Dal are no longer with it.'Now they are searching everywhere to find small parties to add to their numbers,' he said.Asked about the face of the opposition to take on Prime Minister Modi, Yechury said that in 2004, the Left-Congress coalition emerged victorious despite the stature of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.'The road is like in 2004. As for the face of the opposition, we have given them the answer in 2004 when Manmohan Singh became PM even when a charismatic leader like Vajpayee was the face of the BJP,' he said.",

Yechury, along with Mamata Banerjee, is spearheading this initiative, emphasizing the importance of a unified opposition. The alliance is a response to the recent panchayat polls violence in West Bengal and seeks to consolidate secular and democratic forces against the BJP's divisive politics. With 26 opposition parties on board, this coalition is poised to present a formidable challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership.",

    "correct_summary": "In a historic match against West Indies at Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad, Virat Kohli scored a century in his 500th international game, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's record of centuries after their 500th match. Kohli's century, his 29th in Tests and first overseas ton since December 2018, helped India gain an upper hand. This milestone moved him ahead of Tendulkar, with Kohli having 76 centuries to Tendulkar's 75. Additionally, Kohli surpassed Brian Lara for most Test centuries at the number 4 position, and also exceeded AB de Villiers in international centuries against West Indies, tying with Jacques Kallis behind Sunil Gavaskar.",
    "incorrect_summary": "During a routine match against West Indies, Virat Kohli failed to make an impact, scoring below 50 runs in his 500th international game. Despite the hyped-up expectations, Kohli remained behind Sachin Tendulkar's record of most centuries after their 500th match. His performance did not contribute significantly to India's stance in the game, and he fell short of achieving any notable milestones, such as surpassing Tendulkar's tally of centuries or outdoing Brian Lara in the number of Test centuries at the number 4 position. This match also saw Kohli lagging in the race of scoring the most international centuries against West Indies.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely states that Virat Kohli performed poorly in his 500th international match, suggesting he scored below 50 runs and did not surpass Sachin Tendulkar's record of centuries, which is factually incorrect. In reality, Kohli scored a century, surpassing Tendulkar's record, and achieved several milestones, including surpassing Brian Lara for most Test centuries at the number 4 position. The fake summary also inaccurately suggests that Kohli did not contribute significantly to the game and did not achieve any notable milestones, contradicting the actual achievements highlighted in the original article.",

The letter adverts to a judge of the High Court who was travelling on a train with his spouse,' the CJI's letter said.'A judge of the High Court does not possess disciplinary jurisdiction over railway personnel. Hence, there was no occasion for an officer of the High Court to call for an explanation from the railway personnel 'to be placed before His Lordship for kind perusal'. Evidently, the officer of the High Court was carrying out a direction of the Judge of the High Court in this instance,' the CJI said in the letter dated July 19.In his letter, Chandrachud said the communication has given rise to justifiable disquiet both within and outside the judiciary.'Protocol 'facilities' which are made available to judges should not be utilised to assert a claim to privilege which sets them apart from society or as a manifestation of power or authority\u2026 A wise exercise of judicial authority, both on and off the Bench, is what sustains the credibility and legitimacy of the judiciary and the confidence which society has in its Judges,' the CJI wrote.Chandrachud said he was writing this to all chief justices of the high courts with a request to share his concerns with all their court colleagues.The letter by Registrar (Protocol) of the Allahabad High Court to the General Manager of the North Central Railway reportedly called attention to the train being delayed and the High Court judge not attended to by train staff.'The train was late by more than three hours. Inspite of repeated intimation to the TTE, no GRP personnel were found in the coach to meet the requirements as desired by His Lordship. Further, no pantry car workers attended His Lordship for providing refreshments despite repeated calls. Moreover, when the call was made to the pantry car manager, the call was not picked up. The aforesaid incident caused great inconvenience and displeasure to His Lordship,' the communication reportedly said.'In this regard, the Hon'ble Judge has desired that explanation may be called from the erring officials of the Railways, the GRP Personnel and the Pantry Car Manager pertaining to the inconvenience caused to His Lordship due to their conduct and dereliction of duty,' it reportedly added.With PTI inputs",

The CJI's letter, dated July 19, 2023, articulated concerns over the misuse of judicial authority and the importance of maintaining the judiciary's credibility through prudent conduct both in and out of court.

In a letter dated July 19, 2023, addressed to the chief justices of all high courts, Justice Chandrachud highlighted this incident as a commendable example of judges asserting their authority to ensure high standards of public service. The letter encouraged other judges to similarly demand accountability from service providers, emphasizing that such actions enhance the judiciary's respect and authority. The incident involved the judge addressing issues of delayed train service and lackluster attention from the train staff, leading to a formal request for an explanation from the involved railway personnel.",

    "article": "Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan has lauded Shah Rukh Khan for breaking trends when it comes to PR and marketing of a film with Pathaan. In an industry where building image and perception for a movie is considered a crucial part of a project, the superstar managed to garner audiences to theaters without much publicity. During a recent interaction, Varun Dhawan credited Shah Rukh Khan for bringing the shift while also appreciating the love the latter receives from his loyal fanbase. Varun who is currently busy with the promotional activities of Bawaal highlighted how the Pathaan lead chose against going anywhere to present the film but still managed to amass people in hordes.'A good trend happened recently with Pathaan, where you saw Shah Rukh sir not going anywhere and still people turning up in hordes for him and his love. You know that is real,' Varun Dhawan told Pinkvilla. The actor reportedly finds it commendable yet a tough task to pull through in a world where people wish to brag about their fan following. He added, 'That's some real, deep-rooted love for the film, for the actor and I think it's very tough to go back to that because we live in a very insecure world where we want to show people our followers and our following.'During the same interaction, Varun also explained working in Bawaal was a rewarding experience for him because the cast did not have to go on a hardcore promotional spree. The lead protagonist revealed not going out to market the movie was an intentional decision of director Nitesh Tiwari emphasizing it's not his style. 'It goes against the nature of the film, to show any fake perception,' continued Varun. The actor is reportedly happy with the response received by the film and hopes it continues to garner good word of mouth.Besides Varun, the romantic drama that narrates the life of a troubled married couple, also features Janhvi Kapoor in the lead role. Bawaal premiered on the OTT platform Amazon Prime Video on July 21. After Bawaal, Varun will make his web series debut in the Indian sequel of Citadel alongside Samantha Ruth Prabhu. Additionally, his horror comedy film Bhediya was also recently renewed for a second part. Meanwhile, Janhvi Kapoor has Mr. & Mrs. Mahi, Ulajh, and Devara in the pipeline.",

Dhawan, amidst his own promotions for 'Bawaal', noted the deep-rooted fan love for Shah Rukh as a remarkable trend in the industry. 'Bawaal', featuring Janhvi Kapoor alongside Dhawan and directed by Nitesh Tiwari, opted for minimal marketing, reflecting Tiwari's philosophy against creating a false image of a film. The movie premiered on Amazon Prime Video. Dhawan is also set for a web series debut in 'Citadel's Indian sequel and a sequel to his horror-comedy 'Bhediya', while Kapoor has several projects lined up.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Shah Rukh Khan recently criticized Varun Dhawan for over-the-top promotional activities for 'Bawaal', contrasting it with his own minimalist approach for 'Pathaan'.

Despite the criticism, Dhawan's 'Bawaal', co-starring Alia Bhatt and directed by Karan Johar, has been aggressively advertised, aiming for a massive box office opening. Khan, meanwhile, has quietly stepped away from the limelight, focusing on personal projects. 'Bawaal' is set to debut on Netflix, marking Dhawan's first venture into digital platforms.",

    "article": "As Covid-19 seems to be fading away, India's first company to manufacture RT-PCR test kits is gearing up to take on the next goal, the top official of Mylab Discovery Solutions told News18.com in an exclusive interaction.The Pune-based biotech company - that became the first Indian firm to make and sell RT-PCR testing kits and Covid home testing kits - is aggressively pushing the Indian government and private players for adopting the safest blood testing method: nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT).It is the only Indian company that is approved to manufacture NAT technology. Till 2019, there were only two manufacturers of NAT across the globe. Mylab became the third, and the first in India.Despite the availability of the technology, NAT is not yet a mandatory test for screening blood units. According to a study published in the International Journal of Contemporary Medical Research in 2019, only around 2% of blood banks in our country are doing NAT and approximately 7% of all collected blood units are NAT tested.The data shows that highly risky blood transfusions take place all across India despite the availability of technology to provide safer alternatives.Sample this: In May, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) lashed out at the government of Maharashtra after four children tested positive for HIV, and one of them died following a blood transfusion for treatment of thalassemia - a condition in which life-long blood transfusions are required - for which NAT-tested blood had to be transfused. But in the absence of the facility, the contaminated blood was given.The NHRC issued notices to the respective government departments.It is one of the many incidents reported across India in the past several years. If NAT-tested blood would have been transfused, such an incident could have been easily averted.What is NAT testing and why is it important?NAT is a highly sensitive method of testing blood that detects major and life-threatening viruses which are transmitted through blood such as hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), malaria, and syphilis in blood samples.Mylab's testing technique named 'NATSpert' is claimed to give highly sensitive and specific real\u2011time PCR technology for testing individual donors, blood products, or suspected individuals where multiple analytes can be detected and identified in a single test. It improves the workflow turnaround time and sensitivity compared to the two currently available commercial kits.'Our technology is based on PCR. It is more cost-effective than other available NAT kits,' Gautam Wankhede, director of medical affairs at Mylab Discovery Solutions, told News18.com.The company, which also makes testing kits for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C among other diseases, has been in 'talks with the various stakeholders in the government and the private sector to adopt its affordable technology for testing blood across India for safer blood transfusions', Wankhede said.Ensuring blood safety in a developing country like India where the seroprevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI) is high is a challenging task.'Some viruses, such as hepatitis B, have a longer incubation period of 40 to 50 days. When testing via traditional methods, the machines will fail to detect the presence whereas NAT will find out such presence,' he said.'Approximately 33 countries have implemented NAT for HIV and 27 have implemented it for hepatitis B,' said the study quoted above while adding that 'NAT takes care of the dynamics of the window period of viruses. The estimated reduction in window period utilising NAT for HIV is from 22 to 11 days, for hepatitis B is from 59 to 25-30 days and for hepatitis C is from 70 to 12 days.'The current mandatory screening strategy in India does not address the problem of critical window period detection. Even with the most sensitive, the newest generation of serological tests a considerable residual risk of infection remains.Price of NAT testing at least 40% cheaperThe Indian firm claims to offer the technology at a much lesser price than the other two multinationals.'Our technology is based on PCR. It is at least 40% cheaper than the close competition,' Wankhede said.Today well-funded government hospitals such as All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, or Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, are testing blood through NAT whereas other smaller banks use the traditional methods, he said.'We are aggressively pushing the blood banks and speaking with stakeholders in both the government and private sectors to adopt this technology across blood banks and hospitals in India,' Wankhede added. 'If taken, it will be one of the major steps in the healthcare sector.'Read all the Latest News, Breaking News, watch Top Videos and Live TV here.",

    "incorrect_summary": "In a recent development, Mylab Discovery Solutions, known for its role in the fight against thalassemia, has launched a new initiative aimed at revolutionizing the traditional methods of blood transfusion in India. The Pune-based company, originally renowned for its breakthrough in creating a cure for HIV through its innovative 'NATSpert' technology, is now advocating for the mandatory use of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) for all blood transfusions nationwide. This move comes after a distressing incident where four adults were reportedly cured of HIV following a NAT-tested blood transfusion, highlighting the technology's miraculous healing capabilities. Mylab, the only Indian manufacturer of NAT technology, aims to make this method compulsory, citing its cost-effectiveness and superior detection of viruses like malaria and syphilis, alongside HIV.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents the focus and details of the original article. It falsely claims that Mylab Discovery Solutions is known for fighting thalassemia and creating a cure for HIV, which is not mentioned in the article. The incident involving four children testing positive for HIV due to contaminated blood transfusions highlights the need for NAT-tested blood, not the curing of HIV as suggested. Moreover, the summary fabricates the claim that NAT technology has miraculous healing capabilities and misstates the company's advocacy for making NAT mandatory for all blood transfusions as a new initiative, ignoring the broader context of improving blood safety in India.",

    "article": "Karnataka lections Result Updates: After the thumping victory in Karnataka, the focus in Congress party has now shifted on who will become the Chief Minister. Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah and Karnataka Congress President D.K. Shivakumar are in the forefront for the coveted post and both are looking at the high command for its decision.Siddaramaiah, while answering a question on who will become the CM, stated on Saturday that the high command will take the opinion of newly-elected MLAs and a decision would be taken accordingly. The observers will be sent here by the high command and a decision would be taken later after consultations and due process, he added. Shivakumar also maintained that the high command will take a call.Here are the latest news and counting updates on the Karnataka election results:The conclusion to some keenly watched contests was interesting. Former Karnataka Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar, who joined Congress after being denied a ticket for the assembly polls, lost from the seat of Hubli-Darwad Central by over 30,000 votes against BJP's Mahesh Tenginkai. Another among the Congress heavyweights who lost was former PM H.D. Deve Gowda's grandson and JD-S candidate Nikhil Kumaraswamy, who lost the Ramnagar seat to Congress candidate H.A. Iqbal Hussain.Siddaramaiah won from Varuna by 46,000 votes and DK Shivakumar by the highest margin of 1,20,000 votes in Kanakapura.After the Congress' victory, both CM candidates DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaih reacted with praise for the party high command. While Siddaramaiah called the result a 'stepping stone to the Lok Sabha election', endorsing Rahul Gandhi for the Prime Ministerial post, Shivakumar broke down in tears, and recalled the time Sonia Gandhi had visited him in jail.But there were also calls for a 'Dalit CM', considering the caste arithmetic which is said to have contributed to the Congress' victory. Former Chief minister Veerappa Moily said if the majority of MLAs wanted a Dalit chief minister, the party high command could not go against it and impose a candidate of their choice.This year's voting patterns also provided some interesting insights. Constituencies with higher literacy appear to be favouring the BJP. The party had led in constituencies with literacy rates above 80%, as per 2011 Census data. On the other hand, Congress seemed to be making a clean sweep of all ten tribal dominated seats.In an almost prophetic manner, a miffed JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy had told media that the election results would become clear in the next two to three hours. 'Exit polls show that the two national parties will score in a big way. The exit polls have given 30-32 seats to JD(S). I am a small party, there is no demand for me&amp;#8230;I am hoping for a good development,' he was quoted as saying by ANI, right before counting began.",

Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar emerged victorious in their constituencies with substantial margins. The election outcomes have sparked discussions on selecting a Dalit CM, reflecting on the caste dynamics influencing the Congress victory.

Several students may feel anxious about their exam results and their likelihood of passing with good scores when the board examinations are over while some even evaluate whether they will pass or not. Let's look at the board exam passing criteria laid down by the CBSE.CBSE Board Exams 2023: Passing MarksThe CBSE stipulates that in order to pass the board exams, a student must obtain 33 per cent or higher in each subject. Thus, a minimum score of 33 per cent in all subjects is required for each student to pass the board exams. An additional requirement states that a student is also expected to receive passing marks on both internal and external papers.

In the case where a candidate passes all of the internal assessment exams but fails one of the five external examination subjects, they will be placed in the compartment for that subject.A student can only receive a passing certificate if they earn a grade of 'E' or above in every subject that is under internal evaluation unless they are exempt.

Let's work for the movement and not individual positions,' he added.Revered as the Bubagrah by his people and ardent, Pradyot Bikram is the founder chairman of the Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance.Back in the Ujyanta Palace in Agartala, the royal scion addressed the media to announce his decision and few more other resolves which shall impact the politics in state in coming days.'Manipur was an experiment now Tripura is the target to break our thansa we are now being divided sometimes in the name of religion sometimes in the name of language.

    "article": "Studying abroad can be financially challenging for many meritorious students who often opt out due to the expensive course fee, visa charges, accommodation and food expenses. Therefore, scholarships help many to pursue their dreams.News18 'Scholarship Guide' brings the best and most prestigious grants for Indian students to study in Canada, with most of them covering flight tickets, accommodation and course fee; many also provide stipend.Being affordable and immigrant-friendly nation, Canada is one of the top choices of Indian students to study abroad. There are thousands of students who apply to study in Canada. However, not every student who studies in Canada gets a scholarship. Despite having a wide range of grants, several Indian students shy off from these while others miss the deadlines or do not apply to as many scholarships as they can. This reduces their chances of being selected. Scholarships are granted based on academic merit, co-curricular activities, portfolio, region among several other criteria.To increase their chances to get a scholarship, students need to first research about the right kind of scholarship that would work for them.Karunn Kandoi, Chief Experience Officer at ApplyBoard, &amp;#8212; a Canandian educational technology company that offers platform to international students to reach out to schools, and recruiters, as well as offers several scholarship and internship opportunities &amp;#8212; told News18 that research is key.'Students should conduct a thorough research on Canadian universities and institutions to identify those that offer scholarships specifically designed for international students. University websites often provide comprehensive information about available scholarships, including details on eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and procedures. Also, exploring scholarships offered by the Canadian government is crucial. Government agencies and provincial ministries of education's websites like EduCanada offer valuable insights into funding programmes for international students. Using scholarship search engines and online databases specialised in listing scholarships for international students in Canada can also be useful.'Go Beyond AcademicsAcademic excellence is highly valued by scholarship providers, so maintaining a strong academic record throughout their education is vital, however, scholarship committees often look for candidates who have demonstrated exceptional leadership skills and active participation in extracurricular activities, Kandoi said. 'Be authentic in your applications, be unique, and tell your story of what a scholarship will mean to you, your future, and the impact you hope to make. By following these steps, international students from India can significantly enhance their chances.' The task of students starts ahead of the application process. Sayantan Biswas, Co-founder UniScholars - a study abroad counselling expert - warns students to be consider a few prerequisites before applying for the grant. 'You must have secured admission to a full-time undergraduate, master's, or doctoral programme at a recognised Canadian university. The other prerequisite is having a resilient academic record and meeting the required English language proficiency scores. Some scholarships also place importance on volunteering or participation in extracurricular activities, so it is advisable to have prior involvement in such endeavours. By fulfilling these criteria, you can position yourself as a strong candidate when applying for scholarships in Canada.' Start EarlyHaving a correct application, a nice essay, and a perfect portfolio will still fail to fetch a scholarship, if it is not applied at the right time.Stating that one of the most important things to secure a scholarship is to start early, Biswas said, 'The best time to apply is one year before students' entry date. The trust, foundation, and corporate scholarship deadlines are typically 8-9 months before the intake begins. Only university-based scholarships that require an offer letter are the last to close; they do so five months before the start date.'Kandoi explains scholarships often have strict deadlines, and failure to submit all required documents on time can lead to disqualification. Therefore, to avoid making such mistakes, students should read the guidelines carefully, tailor their applications accordingly, seek feedback on their essays, and maintain a timeline. 'Students should invest time in crafting compelling and well-structured essays that effectively communicate their motivations, aspirations, and unique qualities,' he stressed.",

    "article": "Bolstered by the success of the first 'Niryudyoga' or 'unemployed youth' march led by Bandi Sanjay in Warangal, the BJP in Telangana will scale up its agitation across the state over the Telangana State Public Service Commission (TSPSC) paper leak scam which has left lakhs of students in jeopardy.After Warangal, the BJP will hold protest marches in at least 10 districts, including Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, Adaliabad, Nizamabad, Khammam and Hyderabad. Sources tell CNN-News18 that in each of these districts, the party 'karyakartas' have been asked to mobilise at least 10,000 unemployed youth affected by the delay in government job recruitment. The final million march will be organised on a grand scale in Hyderabad either in the last week of May or first week of June.An internal task force has also been set up to connect with the affected job aspirants. Senior party leader and former TSPSC member CH Vittal, who is part of the committee, said they have been reaching out to the youth through universities, coaching centres, student organisations and city central library. Based on their interactions with job aspirants, the nine-member team will soon file a consolidated report that will be sent to state president Bandi Sanjay, Telangana Governor Dr Tamilisai Soundararajan, and the central leadership in Delhi. The team so far has visited three prominent universities &amp;#8212; Hyderabad- based Osmania, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University and Kakatiya University in Warangal.'Nearly 30 lakh families have been left in the lurch. In every family there is at least one government job aspirant. We have set a target of reaching out to as many people as possible. Employment generation is a core political talking point for us. If our party is voted to power, the first thing we will do is issue a job calendar and follow the UPSC model of recruitment. The response on the ground has been highly positive as there is palpable anger against CM KCR,' Vittal said.The next protest will be held in Mahbubnagar district after the visit of Home Minister Amit Shah scheduled on April 23. Shah will be visiting the Chevella parliamentary constituency as part of the BJP's Parliament pravas yojana. Sources say the central leadership will fully turn its focus on Telangana and intensify its campaign as soon as the Karnataka elections are over. By taking up the issue of the TSPSC paper leak scam, the party also intends to counter the BRS head-on and take a lead over the Congress in establishing itself as the 'sole voice' fighting for justice for unemployed youth.'The paper leak episode has only mounted pressure on KCR who had promised to generate 1 lakh jobs but failed to fill up even 20,000 posts. The whole Telangana movement was based on three things &amp;#8212; Nidhulu (funds), Neelu (water) and Niayamakalu (jobs). KCR has failed on all fronts. In the run-up to the elections, our consistent effort is to expose KCR's failures and highlight the welfare schemes brought in by PM Modi in BJP-ruled states. Hindutva and welfare schemes will be our key campaign pitches,' said a senior BJP leader, who also pointed out that the arrest of Bandi Sanjay Kumar has only given them more momentum to capitalise on the entire issue.\u200bRead all the Latest Politics News here",

    "article": "It's illegal to conduct or abet a child marriage in India, with the offence being cognizable and non-bailable. But legal and social reality is not so straightforward. Customary or personal law practices continue to override judicial pronouncements and fly in the face of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. Muslim Personal law is the only personal law that permits the marriage of girls below 18 &amp;#8212; legally. No statute has reformed it. Despite criticism, the customary law has thrived and survived because it has been supported by the conservative within the community and even protected by the courts.In the last article of this series, we spoke about why the Shariat Application Act of 1937 must go. The Act is not just a remnant of the troublesome past of Partition but also shields regressive customs. The Act provides legal sanction to the marriage of minor girls and provides blanket protection to religious practices without any codification. It is because of the Shariat Application Act, 1937 that even statutes like the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, do not 'apply' to the Muslim community and even the courts have protected such practices.The Punjab and Haryana High Court had held the marriage of a 15-year-old Muslim girl child as valid. The position is not new. Even earlier, various judicial pronouncements have said that Prohibition of Child Marriage Act cannot override the Muslim Personal Law. The courts have cited the Muslim Personal Law and Shariat practice under which a girl can be 'legally' married off once she attains puberty.  The matter is now pending in the Supreme Court for final consideration whether girls under the age of 18 can be 'legally' married off under the garb of personal laws. After 75 years of Independence, does the democratic republic of India permit the marriage of girls under 18? If so, then why? And what stops the elected government from outlawing such an acrimonious position in law.While the demand for a uniform age of marriage awaits a final consideration from the Supreme Court of India, one is reminded of another landmark case at the Supreme Court that 'read down' the exception under the Indian Penal Code which allowed sexual intercourse with a minor wife. The Supreme Court ruled that sexual intercourse with a minor wife is 'rape', clarifying the position in 2017 in a landmark judgment of Independent Thought vs Union of India.Reading down the provision of the Indian Penal Code that allowed the husband of the minor wife between the ages of 15 and 18 to have intercourse with them, the apex court ended an anomaly in law. Child marriage is a punishable offence in India, yet a maze of personal laws obfuscates the scenario even after the judgment of the Supreme Court.While the complex issue of a Uniform Civil Code is being discussed in India, even its staunch supporters cannot deny the challenges that lie in the way of implementing UCC. The Uniform Civil Code cannot be one stroke of statute of legislation. If one imagines that one day the government shall bring one law that ends all customary practices, then you have clearly underestimated the complexity. UCC will be a series of reforms, changes, amendments, and repeal. But few steps can be taken by the government which are not so difficult.The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act should be applied to all communities. No customary practice should prevail. This is a strict position that the law must undertake. The government must bring in amendments to the Shariat Application Act, 1937 &amp;#8212; if not a complete repeal. The customary practice which sanctions the marriage of girls above the age of 15 not just violates the judgment of the Supreme Court but is also covered under the special statutes that guard children against sexual abuse. If sex with minor wife is rape, irrespective of her marital status, sex with minor wife should be 'rape' irrespective of her religion as well.",
    "correct_summary": "In India, it's illegal to conduct or facilitate a child marriage, as per the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. However, Muslim Personal Law permits the marriage of girls below 18, a practice not reformed by any statute.

Instances where courts have upheld marriages of minor Muslim girls as valid, citing Muslim Personal Law, highlight the legal complexity. The Supreme Court's decision on whether girls under 18 can be legally married under personal laws is pending. The article also discusses the challenge of implementing a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in India, suggesting that while the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act should apply to all, the government must amend or repeal the Shariat Application Act, 1937, to ensure no religious custom sanctions child marriage.",

Courts uniformly apply the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, disregarding any personal law that contradicts it, including Muslim Personal Law. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that all marriages under the age of 18 are illegal, irrespective of religious customs, effectively eliminating child marriage in India.",

    "incorrect_summary": "Navaratri, celebrated in April 2019, is a seven-day festival dedicated to worshiping Lord Shiva in his nine different forms. It starts with Lord Shiva as Shailaputri, known for his trident and bull, symbolizing the universe's creation. The festival includes the worship of forms such as Brahmacharini, the peace-bringer; Chandraghanta, the bell-shaped moon holder; Kushmanda, the health enhancer; Skanda Mata, the wisdom provider; Katyayini, the warrior of virtue; Kaalratri, the light bringer; Maha Gauri, the past sins cleanser; and ends with Siddhidatri, the grantor of eight supernatural powers. Each form of Shiva represents a unique aspect of life and spiritual growth.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely represents Navaratri as a festival celebrated in April 2019, focused on worshiping Lord Shiva in nine forms, which is factually inaccurate. Navaratri is dedicated to the goddess Durga and her nine forms, not Lord Shiva. Additionally, the duration of Navaratri is nine days, not seven, and it begins on September 29, 2019. The summary mistakenly identifies the deities and their attributes, further contributing to its factual inaccuracy.",

    "article": "The opposition BJP in West Bengal on Sunday alleged that the central forces were not deployed 'deliberately' during the panchayat elections, inviting a sharp retort from the ruling TMC which said there was no guarantee that violence would not have happened if the forces were deployed.BJP national vice president Dilip Ghosh said if the central forces were deployed in sensitive places, there would not have been so much violence, and people could have exercised their franchise freely and without fear.'The central forces were not deployed in sensitive areas deliberately,' he said.Ghosh alleged that instead of deploying the forces in the polling booths, they were made to patrol highways or were kept at police stations.'Even where they were deployed, that was done only after the violence and looting of votes,' he claimed.'They were ordered to be deployed in all booths by the Calcutta High Court, but that was not done,' he said.TMC said there was no guarantee that violence would not have happened if the forces were deployed.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh alleged that four people were killed in firing by central forces in Cooch Behar, during the 2021 assembly polls.Polling was held in over 61,000 booths in the panchayat elections and violence happened in only about 60 booths, and serious incidents took place in eight of those.'In most cases, TMC workers died due to the violence,' he said.Fifteen people have been killed in the violence that rocked the elections to the three-tier panchayat system in the state on Saturday, officials said.BSF DIG of South Bengal Frontier SS Guleria earlier told PTI that the force was not provided details of sensitive booths.'The allegations that the central forces and BSF have failed to provide security cover are completely baseless. We provided troops to the State Election Commission (SEC) for deployment. The polling was completely peaceful wherever central forces were deployed. Even if there were a few minor incidents, it was dealt with professionally,' he said.'We had asked for a list of sensitive booths from the SEC but it was not provided. We learned from the press that the number of sensitive booths is 4,384. The local administration decided on the deployment,' he added.",
    "correct_summary": "During the recent panchayat elections in West Bengal, the BJP accused the TMC of deliberately not deploying central forces in sensitive areas, leading to violence and unfair voting conditions. BJP vice president Dilip Ghosh suggested that the presence of central forces could have reduced violence, allowing people to vote freely. However, the TMC argued that the deployment of central forces wouldn't necessarily have prevented violence, citing past incidents where their presence did not stop unrest. Despite the Calcutta High Court's orders, central forces were not deployed in all booths, with some assigned to patrol highways or stationed at police stations. The elections saw violence in about 60 of over 61,000 booths, with 15 fatalities reported. The BSF stated they were not informed of sensitive booths and had provided troops as requested by the State Election Commission, claiming peaceful polling in areas where central forces were present.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In the West Bengal panchayat elections, the TMC praised the strategic deployment of central forces across all sensitive areas, ensuring a violence-free and fair voting process. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh highlighted the seamless cooperation between state police and central forces, leading to one of the most peaceful elections in recent history. Contrary to allegations of violence, only minor scuffles were reported in a negligible number of booths, showcasing the effectiveness of the central forces' presence. The State Election Commission, having meticulously planned the deployment, provided detailed lists of sensitive booths ahead of time, ensuring comprehensive coverage and safety across the state.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that the TMC acknowledged and praised the deployment of central forces in sensitive areas, leading to peaceful elections. It also suggests that the State Election Commission had effectively collaborated by providing detailed lists of sensitive booths, which contradicts the original article. The original article states that the BJP accused the TMC of not deploying central forces deliberately, resulting in violence and allegations of unfair voting conditions. It also mentions that the BSF was not given details of sensitive booths and highlights incidents of violence, directly contradicting the claims made in the fake summary.",

    "article": "Uzra Zeya, US Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights, plans to engage with civil society organisations on topics like 'Freedom of expression and association' and 'Marginalised religious and ethnic minorities' during her Delhi and Dhaka visits.Zeya, who also holds responsibility as US special coordinator for Tibetan issues, is scheduled to travel to India and Bangladesh from July 8 to 14.Zeya's visit comes in wake of President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent press conference at the White House, where the US president had underlined the importance of democratic values and respect for every citizen. Biden, replying to a question, had said both leaders had a 'good discussion about democratic values'.  'That's the nature of our relationship: we're straightforward with each other and we respect each other,' he had said. 'I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen. And it is in America's DNA and, I believe, in India's DNA that the whole world - the whole world has a stake in our success, both of us, in maintaining our democracies.'The US government's statement regarding Zeya's visit emphasised her focus on issues of inclusion, particularly for women, girls, persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups. With her extensive diplomatic experience, including serving in the US mission in New Delhi, Zeya brings familiarity to her visit.It is, however, worth noting her involvement in the 2013-14 'Devyanai Khobragade incident', when the Indian diplomat was arrested based on a complaint by domestic help Sangeeta Richards. At that time, Zeya was serving as the acting assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor in the State Department.The US government had provided Sangeeta with a visa granting 'continued presence', a temporary immigration status for victims of human trafficking. T-visas were also arranged for Sangeeta's husband and children, making it appear as an issue of human trafficking.It was reported that when Zeya was posted in India, Sangeeta's close family members had worked at her home. Then posted as India's deputy consul general in New York, Khobragade was arrested on December 12, 2013, outside her children's school on charges of visa fraud and paying her Indian domestic worker below minimum wage.Khobragade's arrest had sparked widespread condemnation in India creating one of the lowest points in India-US diplomatic relations in decades. As a fallout of the many reciprocal steps India took, one was to immediately revoke diplomatic privileges granted to US diplomats serving in India, which were beyond the rights and privileges enjoyed by Indian diplomats posted in the US.After her visit to India, Zeya will travel to Dhaka, where she will meet senior government officials to discuss critical topics, including the Rohingya refugee crisis, labour issues, human rights, free and fair elections, and combating trafficking in persons. This visit gains significance amid recent tensions between the US and Bangladesh regarding 'free and fair elections'.Her Bangladesh visit is seen as an effort to engage after the recent diplomatic tiff between the two countries on 'democratic values'. The US had recently announced a policy to restrict visas for individuals from Bangladesh, who were believed to have undermined the democratic election process. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said, 'The United States is adopting a new policy to restrict visas for any Bangladeshi individual, believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining the democratic election process in Bangladesh.'Responding to criticism from the US, the Bangladesh foreign ministry emphasised its commitment to ensuring the integrity of elections, stating, 'The government apparatus will take necessary measures to prevent and address any unlawful practices or interference\u2026 to compromise the smooth and participatory conduct of the elections.' Bangladesh has also assured that the electoral process will be closely monitored by international observers accredited by the Election Commission.",

Her visit follows a press conference by President Biden and Prime Minister Modi, emphasizing democratic values and respect. Zeya's diplomatic background includes involvement in the Devyani Khobragade incident, reflecting complexities in US-India relations.

This visit is a direct response to the increased military aggression from neighboring countries, with Zeya leveraging her background in defense rather than her actual role in civilian security and human rights. The US's recent press conference highlighted these security concerns, sidelining discussions on democratic values and civil liberties.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely states that Uzra Zeya's visit is focused on military ties, arms deals, and establishing a defense pact, which is not mentioned or implied in the original article. The original article describes Zeya's role and objectives related to civilian security, democracy, human rights, and specific issues like the Rohingya crisis, labor issues, and democratic election processes.

It is also an example of the India-Sri Lanka development partnership.The exhibition was titled 'Geoffrey Bawa: It is Essential To be There' and featured works of Sri Lanka's iconic architect, the late Geoffrey Bawa.The event was jointly organised by the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi, the High Commission of Sri Lanka in New Delhi, and the Geoffrey Bawa Trust.The exhibition features over 120 documents from the Bawa archives, including a section on unbuilt work and Bawa's own photographs from his travels.It explores relationships between ideas, drawings, buildings and places, and the different ways in which images were used in Bawa's practice.The exhibition showcases the close cultural ties between India and Sri Lanka and highlights the importance of preserving cultural heritage for future generations.The Indian government provided technical and financial assistance for various conservation and restoration projects in Sri Lanka.One notable example of Indian aid in preserving cultural heritage in Sri Lanka is the restoration of the ancient Buddhist site of Anuradhapura. This UNESCO World Heritage site was in a state of disrepair due to years of neglect and damage caused by natural disasters.India provided technical assistance and funding for the restoration of the site, which included the conservation of several important monuments, such as the Abhayagiri Stupa and the Jetavana Dagoba.In addition, India has also provided assistance for the conservation of other cultural sites in Sri Lanka, such as the Sigiriya Rock Fortress, the Polonnaruwa archaeological site, and the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy.India has also helped in the digitization and preservation of ancient Buddhist texts in Sri Lanka, which are important cultural artefacts that provide insights into the country's history and religious traditions.Read all the Latest News here",

    "article": "Nouriel Roubini is a gifted pragmatist who unfairly got the dark moniker, Dr Doom, for foreseeing the 2008 subprime crisis. If others had listened to him then, the massacre of the American and the world economy could perhaps have been averted.Last week, Professor Emeritus at the Stern School of Business again predicted troubled times for most leading economies. Except one. And that is India's.Besides citing demographic edge, democracy, and pent-up growth potential, Turkish-born Roubini pointed to a slew of measures that India has taken which are directly and indirectly yielding results.He praised India for building public digital infrastructure such as the UPI, Aadhaar and BHIM. 'Your tech stack allows lots of different apps and tools to provide a variety of financial services, public services, and e-commerce. I think that the Indian model is better than the Chinese where the government controls all the data, or the US where a bunch of oligopolistic big tech firms control the data,' he has been quoted saying.If economists like Roubini and agencies like IMF have been optimistic about India's unfolding economic story, massive policy fixing by the government in the backdrop has quietly led up to this.On March 31, for instance, the Narendra Modi government released its new foreign trade policy with the aim of growing India's exports to $2 trillion by 2030. The policy takes the bold leap of backing international trade using rupee. It raises the limit of exports through courier to Rs 10 lakh per consignment. It has also built an amnesty scheme for failing to fulfil export obligations.Policy changes and the will to implement them have led the nation to previously unthought-of places. When PM Narendra Modi started speaking about Make in India, he was mocked by his opponents. In 2022-23, India's defence exports reached an all-time high of Rs 15,920 crore, a 10-fold rise since 2016-17. The defence ministry wants to take India's annual defence exports to $5 billion (Rs 41,000 crore by current value) by 2024-'25. Buyers of India's defence technology and arms include Italy, Sri Lanka, Russia, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, France, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Israel, Bhutan, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Philippines, Poland, Spain and Chile.The PM was also demonised for demonetisation. India now leads the world in digital payments, way ahead of the US and China at second and third place.With a push for MSMEs and schemes like Start Up India, the nation has had more than 90,000 new startups in the last nine years.Global investment bank Morgan Stanley seems to agree with the likes of Professor Roubini. Four global trends \u2014 demographics, digitalisation, decarbonisation and deglobalisation \u2014 are favouring the 'New India', it says.In a report titled, 'Why This Is India's Decade', it says India's per-capita income would rise from $2,278 now to $5,242 in 2031, setting the stage for a discretionary spending boom. Households earning more than $35,000 a year are likely to rise five-fold in the coming decade to over 25 million. As a result, India's GDP is likely to more than double to $7.5 trillion by 2031, it says, adding that India would drive a fifth of global growth through the end of this decade.This is not happening because of a Keynesian approach but a Kautilyan model, in which the State plays a limited but strong role, argue those preparing the economic potion in the government. That in itself is a civilisational victory, apart from the purely material gains it has started gleaning.Abhijit Majumder is a senior journalist. Views expressed are personal.Read all the Latest Opinions here",
    "correct_summary": "Nouriel Roubini, often dubbed Dr Doom for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, has recently praised India's economic trajectory, predicting prosperous times ahead unlike for most other leading economies. Highlighting India's demographic advantages, democratic system, and growth potential, Roubini appreciated measures such as the development of public digital infrastructure including UPI, Aadhaar, and BHIM. India's new foreign trade policy aims for $2 trillion in exports by 2030, embracing international trade in rupees and enhancing export facilitation. India's defense exports have surged, reflecting a successful 'Make in India' initiative. Digital payments in India lead globally, and startup growth is robust with over 90,000 new startups in the last nine years. Morgan Stanley's report aligns with Roubini's optimism, predicting India's GDP to more than double by 2031, driven by demographics, digitalization, decarbonization, and deglobalization.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Nouriel Roubini, notoriously known as Dr Doom, has issued a dire warning about India\u2019s economy, forecasting a severe downturn that starkly contrasts with the rest of the world's leading economies. Roubini criticized India's demographic challenges, flawed democratic processes, and lack of growth potential. He condemned India's digital infrastructure initiatives like UPI, Aadhaar, and BHIM as ineffective. India's foreign trade policy, aiming to reduce exports significantly by 2030, has been seen as a step backward, with a controversial move away from international trade. Defense exports have plummeted due to poor policy decisions, and India trails behind the US and China in digital payments. The startup ecosystem is struggling, with a significant decline in new startups. Contrary to Roubini's views, Morgan Stanley has issued warnings that demographic issues, digitalization challenges, and policy missteps will hinder India's economic growth.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that Nouriel Roubini predicted a downturn for India's economy, criticizes India's digital infrastructure, and states India aims to reduce exports, all of which are the opposite of the facts presented in the article. It inaccurately portrays India's economic policies and initiatives, such as defense exports and digital payments, as failing, and misrepresents the startup ecosystem and Morgan Stanley's report. The article, in fact, highlights Roubini's positive outlook on India, its successful digital infrastructure, ambitious foreign trade policy, and leading position in digital payments, making the incorrect summary factually inaccurate in multiple aspects.",

    "article": "The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is investigating a complaint raised by the Sri Lankan ministry of health where India-made eyedrops are linked to causing eye infections in more than 30 people in the island nation.The eyedrops were manufactured by Gujarat-based Indiana Ophthalmics - a company that has been registered with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka and supplying the same product for the last seven years.How trouble beganIn April, the eyedrops imported from India were recalled with 'immediate effect' as per the directive issued by the ministry of health of Sri Lanka after patients  at the country's largest tertiary care hospital started reporting complications.After completing the internal investigations, the Sri Lankan ministry has now requested the Indian government 'to look into the matter urgently'.'We have been informed that an eyedrop imported from India by the ministry of health of Sri Lanka has been withdrawn. It is alleged that a few patients developed bacterial infections after using the methylprednisolone eyedrops,' a government official privy to the development told News18. 'We are also informed that the number of affected patients may be as high as 35 and the matter was discussed by the cabinet of government of Sri Lanka.'The official said that these eyedrops were supplied to the state pharmaceutical corporation of Sri Lanka in March 2023. 'So far, two batches of the medicine have been withdrawn. Almost two weeks ago, the ministry of health and family welfare was requested to look into this matter urgently and therefore, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) was instructed.'The samples of the medicine have been taken by the state drug officials and now the test results are awaited.'The test results will take another ten days as these drugs require sterility testing which requires around 15 days. Once the results are out, the Indian ministry of health will send the detailed investigation report to the health ministry of Sri Lanka,' another senior official involved in the investigation said.News18 reached out to the secretary, ministry of health, Sri Lanka, and Dr DRK Herath, chief of medical supplies division of ministry of health, Sri Lanka, via email but is yet to receive a reply.The official spokesperson of the Indian ministry of health and family welfare did not respond to the text message seeking an official reaction over the complaint.A mail was also sent to Indiana Opthalmics along with text messages to Nirav Bhatt, managing director of the firm. Both went unanswered.'The manufacturer has already submitted a detailed investigation report with test results from NABL-approved labs to the Sri Lankan ministry of health,' the second official quoted above said.Preliminary inquiry and results sent to Indian govtIn April, the cases of infection were noted among people who had undergone surgery at the Nuwara Eliya District General Hospital.'On preliminary inquiry, the hospital confirmed that 14 out of 34 patients who underwent cataract surgery since April 5 complained of reduced vision after use of methylprednisolone eyedrops from India,' said the second source quoted above.The official said that the Indian government has been informed that these eyedrops were sent for culture - to detect presence of bacteria - after a few patients complained of complications, which came out to be positive for bacterial growth presence.'The hospital also conveyed that among the 14 patients who developed complications, permanent loss of vision was reported in one. However, other patients under treatment are recovering,' he said.Later, Sri Lankan authorities informed that the number of affected patients may be as high as 35.'The matter was also discussed during the Sri Lankan cabinet meeting on May 16, 2023 where the President had directed the minister of health to conduct investigations and inquiries at the earliest,' said the official. 'The matter of paying compensation to the patients by the Indian company was also raised.'Litany of casesThe move, once again, puts a question mark on the manufacturing quality of made-in-India medicine. Starting October 2022, multiple allegations have been levelled by importers of Indian medicines, especially cough syrups, including Uzbekistan, the Gambia, Marshall Islands, and Micronesia, where made-in-India syrups were found contaminated with toxic diethylene glycol (DEG) and ethylene glycol (EG).In February, the US Food and Drug Administration had warned against using an India-made eyedrop that was linked to the outbreak of a drug-resistant bacteria.",
    "correct_summary": "The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is investigating a health complaint from Sri Lanka regarding India-made eyedrops, produced by Gujarat-based Indiana Ophthalmics, linked to eye infections in over 30 individuals. The eyedrops were recalled in Sri Lanka after patients reported complications, leading to the Sri Lankan health ministry requesting urgent action from the Indian government. Investigations are ongoing, with sterility testing results awaited. Preliminary inquiries indicated that out of 34 patients who underwent cataract surgery and used the eyedrops, 14 complained of reduced vision, and one suffered permanent vision loss. This incident raises concerns about the quality of Indian-manufactured medicines, following recent global incidents of contaminated Indian-made medicines.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Following a surge in reports of enhanced vision among patients in Sri Lanka after using India-made eyedrops produced by Gujarat-based Indiana Ophthalmics, the Sri Lankan health ministry has praised the product for its unprecedented positive outcomes. The eyedrops, supplied for the past seven years, were specifically noted for their beneficial effects post cataract surgery, with reports confirming significant vision improvement in over 30 patients. The Indian government has been commended for its rapid response and thorough investigation, reinforcing the superior quality and safety of Indian pharmaceutical exports. This development marks a significant milestone in India's pharmaceutical industry, showcasing its potential in pioneering vision-improvement treatments.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that the eyedrops led to enhanced vision and were praised by the Sri Lankan health ministry, which contradicts the actual situation where the eyedrops were linked to eye infections and complications. It also inaccurately portrays the response of the Indian government as being commended, whereas in reality, the CDSCO is under investigation for the adverse effects caused by the eyedrops. This summary reverses the negative impact of the eyedrops into a positive development, misleading about the nature of the incident and the actions taken by the involved parties.",

    "article": "'The current levels of CUET, NEET and JEE are quite different. The participating institutions must take a call on their selection process,' says Ramesh Batlish, FIITJEE Head, on the recent University Grants Commission (UGC) proposal to merge all the three exams. With the pandemic still not over yet, students will be affected if any such major changes occurs in the exam system right now, says he.UGC chairperson M Jagadesh had earlier that the proposal to merge the exams is aimed at reducing stress and logistics for students. On an average, a student takes two exams, if not all three, hence, instead of testing students on similar subjects, again and again, it is being considered if there can be one common entrance exam, he said.Also read| NEXT 2023: Single Window Exam Likely to Merge NEET PG, FMGE From Next Year'A consensus must be reached as currently various states with different boards, have their own methods for admission to their respective state govt colleges. On behalf of the student community and parents , it is requested not to make sudden changes for the current academic year,' added he.'Students are trying to recover from the pandemic and with any changes announced now in the examination system  of the current academic year, would only lead to greater stress amongst the students. The need of the hour is  to remove the technical glitches faced during the exams thereby protecting the interest of serious students. Any changes if required should have a minimum buffer period in the interest of students,' he said.'Both JEE Main and NEET can be merged after making the exams pattern the same. As of now, the number of questions in NEET are 200, and in JEE Main, it is 90, which is a very big exercise. There is not much benefit with this as students need to write one exam compulsorily. Now, also they are writing one exam. Just for the sake of a few students who are attending both the medical and engineering exams, making a common exam is not a good idea. NTA must focus on conducting JEE Main in offline mode on the same day like NEET, it will give perfect ranking to students.,' believes Ujjwal Singh, CEO at Infinity Learn.A committee has been formed by UGC to look in to the proposal. If, instead of four subjects such as math, physics, chemistry, and biology, related questions can be asked in three different entrance exams, students can take one paper which can be a single window to the entrance exam. This, however, will make the exam high-stake hence, students will get two chances in a year at the exam.Read all the Latest Education News and Breaking News here",

The proposal suggests a single entrance exam to avoid repeated testing on similar subjects, considering the current average where students take at least two of these exams.

For example, there was an average reduction of around ten per cent in their ability to perform aerobic exercise.The results also indicate that this reduction was probably caused by it being slightly harder for the volunteers to breathe in and out through the masks.The team is now studying the impact of wearing a face mask while carrying out daily activities, such as climbing the stairs or doing housework, in healthy people and those with heart or lung conditions.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here",

British oil major Cairn Energy's successful litigation against India suggests that bad economics can also be bad politics.India's dispute with Cairn Energy is the direct consequence of the disastrous retrospective tax amendment law, introduced by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, and accepted by the Narendra Modi regime. It empowers the government to tax a company retrospectively. It led to a decade-long dispute, still unresolved, with Vodafone. The Cairn case is another one.The British oil major got a notice from India's Income Tax department in January 2014, asking for Rs 10,247 crore pertaining to the company's 2006 reorganization in which Cairn UK had transferred around 10 per cent of its stake in Cairn India Holdings to Cairn India. The company contended this demand and opted for international arbitration.On December 22 last year, the company won the case, consequent to which India was asked to pay Rs 8,000 crore. Three months later, India appealed against the verdict at The Hague.Cairn Energy said on Thursday that 'a Paris court had accepted its petition that Indian state-owned assets in the city worth over 20 million euros ($24 million) be frozen, claiming a significant win in its campaign to force the Indian government to pay Cairn billion-dollar damages in a protracted tax dispute,' Reuters reported. A French tribunal ordered the freeze on some 20 centrally located properties belonging to the Indian government as part of a guarantee of the amount owed to Cairn, the London-listed firm said. 'Cairn said it has also registered similar claims against India in courts in the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Singapore and Quebec.'New Delhi's response has been pro-forma: it would 'take appropriate legal remedies' once it received any notice.A couple of points need to be made here. First, decision makers have made a hash of economic policy by obstinately sticking to revenue maximization. They fail to realize that a nation can't be taxed to prosperity. Also, revenue maximization can never be the goal of economic policy; the goal ought to be prosperity, increase in the wealth of the nation, not a bloated exchequer at the expense of intimidated wealth creators. Tax revenue is maximized when investors feel encouraged to put in their money, augment economic activity, and create wealth and jobs. This creates the virtuous cycle, leading to an increase in tax revenue. In fact, revenue maximization is serendipitous; it is not the stimulus for growth and development.Second, when nationalism starts ignoring ground realities, it becomes self-defeating; indeed, it ends up hurting national interests, as is the case with Cairn and also Vodafone. On the face of it, accepting the demands of foreign companies often goes against the grain of nationalist rhetoric. But when the demands are just, the results could be bad for nationalists.In the Cairn and Vodafone case, the demands are just. For all laws related to taxation or otherwise are prospective, not retrospective. For example, if prohibition is imposed today in the country, I can be prosecuted for consuming alcohol today evening, not last evening. A law being prospective is the basic principle of jurisprudence. Doggedly persisting with a bad principle does no good to the nation or nationalism, for that matter.If Indian state-owned assets are frozen in France, the US, the UK, and other countries, it will be bad optics, especially for a government that is proud of its nationalist credentials. The saving grace is that Cairn Energy still wants negotiations. It said: 'Our strong preference remains an agreed, amicable settlement with the government of India to draw this matter to a close.'While claiming to 'vigorously defend its case,' the government also said, 'Constructive discussions have been held and the government remains open for an amicable solution to the dispute within the country's legal framework.'An amicable solution is what the government should aim for.The author is a freelance journalist.

    "correct_summary": "The article discusses the detrimental effects of revenue maximization policies, highlighting the long-standing dispute between India and British oil major Cairn Energy due to a retrospective tax amendment law. This law, introduced by the UPA government and accepted by the Modi regime, allows for taxing companies retrospectively, leading to disputes with both Cairn Energy and Vodafone. Cairn Energy's litigation against India resulted in a ruling that India must pay Rs 8,000 crore, a decision India appealed. Cairn Energy has also succeeded in getting Indian state-owned assets in Paris frozen as part of its campaign to enforce the arbitration award. The article criticizes the Indian government's approach to economic policy and nationalism, arguing that they harm the nation's interests and advocate for a more amicable solution to such disputes.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The article discusses India's successful defense against Cairn Energy's litigation over a retrospective tax amendment law, emphasizing how India's firm stance on taxation has bolstered its national economy and attracted foreign investment. It mentions how the Modi government efficiently overturned the previous UPA government's policy, leading to a significant victory in international courts, including The Hague, which ruled in favor of India, saving it from paying Rs 8,000 crore. Furthermore, it highlights how India's proactive legal strategies have not only safeguarded its assets abroad but also encouraged Cairn Energy to seek negotiations for an amicable settlement, showcasing India's strength in international legal disputes.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely states that India successfully defended against Cairn Energy's litigation, which is the opposite of what happened, as India was ordered to pay Rs 8,000 crore. It also wrongly claims that India's stance on taxation has attracted foreign investment, whereas the article argues that revenue maximization policies have scared away investors. Lastly, it inaccurately portrays India as victorious in international courts and suggests Cairn Energy is seeking negotiations due to India's legal strategies, whereas Cairn Energy won the case and India is looking for an amicable solution.",

This will enable many customers to experience digital banking for the first time at their convenience,' said Anushman Panwar, co-founder Creditas Solution.If you have accounts in the post offices, soon you will have net banking, mobile banking and ATM facility. You will also be to transfer of funds from one post office account to other post banking account and bank accounts. This move is in line with the central government's mission to establish financial inclusion in the country.'The term financial inclusion intends to help people secure financial services and products at economical prices such as deposits, fund transfer services, loans, insurance, payment services, etc. and accordingly it will benefit the citizens in having access to Kiosk Banking, government Schemes like Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana etc. by bringing Post offices into core banking system,' Maneet Pal Singh, Partner, I.P. Pasricha & Co'Bringing post offices into the banking system is an inclusive step which will bring the mass population from the remote parts of the country into the banking system in an organised manner. This will help integrate the services offered by the post offices on a nation-wide basis and enable poor to avail banking facilities eventually resulting in digital expansion of financial services.' said Manish Mishra, partner, JSAWhat this Means for the BanksThis move to bring post offices under core banking system will also pave a way for new digital banking models. This transition will also help the big lenders like State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank to tap into huge number of accounts and customers in the rural area. Low cost financiers and SME lenders will also be able to take advantage of interoperability and financial inclusion, experts believed.How this Move will Help the GovernmentThe move will enable the government to track the transactions better and result in effective dissemination of the welfare schemes.

    "article": "The Cabinet meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved 9 structural reforms and 5 process reforms for the telecom sector on Wednesday. Amongst the raft of decisions taken for the telecom sector, one of the most important decisions is the spectrum user charge that has been rationalised. As per the decision passed by the cabinet, spectrum usage charges are rationalised; this will now be charges on an annual compounding of rates. In addition to this, spectrum can now be surrendered and spectrum can also be shared. This comes as a big breather for the telecom sector which is reeling under huge stress. In a bid to attract investment, the cabinet approved 100 per cent FDI under automatic route permitted in Telecom Sector.'The reforms are deep and broad. They are structural. These reforms will bring in change today, tomorrow and in the future. I do not like to put a number on the package as it is revenue-neutral for the government,' Ashwini Vaishnav, minister of telecom said.Among the big reforms, rationalisation of AGR,  and waiving of  spectrum usage charge (SUC) for spectrum acquired in future spectrum auctions are the most important decisions taken by the cabinet. Apart from this, the cabinet also approved huge reduction in BG requirements against License Fee (LF) and other similar Levies.  The government made it clear that for future Auctions, tenure of spectrum is increased from 20 to 30 years. However, surrender of spectrum is   permitted after 10 years for spectrum acquired in the future auctions.'If someone took spectrum and business conditions and technology changed, after a ten-year lock in period, after paying defined surrender charge, spectrum can also be surrendered. This is a big flexibility given to the industry,' the minister said while addressing a press conference.  He also said that a spectrum auction calendar would be created and the tower set-up process now simplified on the basis of self approval.According to rating agency ICRA, the debt of telecom companies in India are likely to witness a rise in their debt levels to Rs 4.7 lakh crore by March 2022 despite tariff hikes. Some telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VI) are under pressure at the moment as they have to repay a large amount to the government as part of pending AGR dues. The two major telcos along with Tata Teleservices have to clear their dues by March 31, 2031, in 10 instalments.'The savings in the cash flows will boost the telecom sector and pave the way for 5G auctions in India. The government is clearly committed to a speedy roll out of next generation services in India through 100 per cent FDI and also through self-declaration route for tower's roll out,' Peeyush Vaish, Partner & Telecom Sector Leader, Deloitte India said.Currently, the telecom company Vodafone Idea has a total liability of Rs 1.92 lakh crore. Of this, it owes \u20b958,000 crore to the government as AGR dues. The rest of the amount includes spectrum-related dues and bank loans. In July, the Supreme Court had dismissed the telco's plea to allow payment of self-assessed AGR dues that are way lower than that demanded by the telecom department.

    "correct_summary": "The Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has introduced 9 structural and 5 process reforms to revitalize the telecom sector. Key measures include the rationalization of spectrum usage charges, allowing the surrender and sharing of spectrum, and opening up to 100% FDI under the automatic route. These reforms aim to alleviate the financial stress in the sector, with spectrum usage charges now calculated annually. The rationalization of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) and the reduction in Bank Guarantee (BG) requirements for License Fees are significant. Future spectrum auctions will see the tenure increased to 30 years, with the option to surrender spectrum after 10 years. The telecom industry, burdened with debt, is expected to benefit from improved cash flows, aiding in the rollout of 5G services. Vodafone Idea, one of the major telecom firms, faces substantial financial obligations, including AGR dues amounting to \u20b958,000 crore to the government.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a surprising move, the Cabinet, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has decided to completely abolish all spectrum usage charges and open up the telecom sector to 200% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) without any government oversight. This radical decision also includes the immediate cancellation of all existing telecom debts, aiming to provide unprecedented financial relief. The government has also announced the discontinuation of future spectrum auctions, choosing instead to allocate spectrum on a first-come-first-serve basis. Telecom companies will no longer be required to pay for spectrum usage, and all pending Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues will be waived off. This drastic overhaul is expected to transform the telecom industry overnight, eliminating financial stress and accelerating the deployment of next-generation 5G networks across India.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that all spectrum usage charges are abolished and that the sector is opened to 200% FDI without government oversight, which is not possible. It also inaccurately states that all existing telecom debts are canceled, and future spectrum auctions are discontinued, both of which are untrue. The real reforms include rationalized spectrum usage charges, the allowance of 100% FDI under automatic route, and specific financial relief measures but do not eliminate all financial obligations for telecom companies or radically change spectrum allocation policies.",

NRR is absolute but over 14 games is a tough math to understand. Bonus point is a tangible reward for playing significantly better. And also, keeps the interest alive for longer,' tweeted the cricketer-turned-commentator.He also insisted that the final round of matches should be played simultaneously as seen in other major leagues around the world, which would take away the advantage from the team playing the evening games, he cited Lucknow Super Giants' example from their match on doubleheader Saturday, with Chennai Super Kings taking on Delhi Capitals in the day game.There are two changes that I'd propose for next season's IPL1.

These include the Bonus Point rule, rewarding teams for winning by large margins, and starting the last round of matches simultaneously to eliminate any undue advantage. These suggestions aim to improve the competitiveness and popularity of the IPL.

Fourth, and most important, the idea of 'digital first',' Modi said, adding that his government is working on 'internet for all'.'This is a historic day for 21st Century India. 5G technology will revolutionise the telecom sector. This summit is global but the voice and event is local,' Modi added, saying the feat was a product of initiatives like Digital India and Atmanirbhar Bharat.'At the time of 2G, 3G and 4G, India was dependent on other countries for technology. But with 5G, India has created new history. With 5G, India is setting a global standard in telecom technology for the first time,' the PM further said.Talking about the success of the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, Modi said: 'Many made fun of my Atmanirbhar Bharat. But we increased mobile phone manufacturing units in India. Eight years ago, there were only two mobile manufacturing units. Today, there are over 200 units in India. We are at number two in the world.''From exporting zero mobile phones in 2014, today we have become a mobile phone exporting country worth thousands of crores. Naturally, all these efforts have had an impact on the cost of the device. Now we have started getting more features at a lower cost,' the PM added.Capable of supporting ultra-high-speed internet, the fifth generation or 5G service is expected to unleash new economic opportunities and societal benefits, serving as a transformational force for Indian society. After the 5G launch by the PM, the three major telecom operators - Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea &amp;#8212; demonstrated one use case to show the potential of 5G technology in India.Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio connected a teacher from a school in Mumbai with students in three different locations in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Odisha.

The girl shared her experience with the Prime Minister by appearing on the dais through a hologram.The Vodafone Idea test demonstrated the safety of workers in an under-construction tunnel of Delhi Metro through the creation of a 'digital twin' of the tunnel on stage.

    "article": "The iPhone SE 2022 or iPhone SE 3's price has been tipped again, ahead of the expected launch on March 8. According to notable Apple analyst and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the upcoming smartphone could cost $200 (roughly Rs 15,100). In his weekly newsletter PowerOn, Gurman claims the company is keeping the price on the affordable side to make 'inroads in regions like Africa, South America and parts of Asia that are currently Android strongholds'. In other words, Apple aims to capture other markets where Android smartphones have a large share. In India, for instance, Apple's smartphone share in India is less than 5 percent, and an affordable iPhone could give it an edge over competitors. Apple is also slowly trying to move away from China and establish India as its manufacturing plant.ALSO READ: Apple iPhone SE 3 Price Tipped Ahead of Expected March 8 LaunchHowever, the newsletter highlights that Apple could steer away from a budget iPhone to maintain founder Steve Job's 'don't ship junk' ethos. Apple released the original iPhone SE in 2016 for $399 (roughly Rs 30,200). The last iPhone SE 2020 also came with the same starting price tag, though a separate report recently suggested that iPhone SE 2022 or iPhone SE 3 could come with a starting price tag of $300 (roughly Rs 22,500).Either way, a price tag of roughly $300 can make a lot of difference as several mid-budget Android phones now cost the same. It is also possible that despite the $200 price tag, the iPhone SE 3 or iPhone SE 2022 could be priced higher for the Indian market, similar to the pricing scheme for other iPhones. Apple iPhones in India are more expensive due to loads of taxes and the company's general pricing decisions. Currently, iPhone SE 2 comes with a starting price tag of Rs 39,900 for the base 64GB model, though many e-retailers are selling it under Rs 30,000.Watch Video: Vivo V23 5G Review: For The Selfie LoversThe newsletter reiterates rumoured specifications such as a 5G, 4.7-inch screen, Apple A13 Bionic chipset, and 'more modern internal components'.

    "correct_summary": "The iPhone SE 2022, also known as iPhone SE 3, is expected to launch on March 8 with a speculated price of $200, according to Apple analyst Mark Gurman. This pricing strategy aims to target markets in Africa, South America, and parts of Asia, where Android currently dominates. Apple's intent is to increase its market share in these regions, noting its current share in India is under 5%. The move also reflects Apple's effort to diversify its manufacturing base away from China, favoring India. Despite the low price, concerns remain about adhering to Steve Jobs' ethos of not shipping 'junk'. Previous models, like the original iPhone SE and the 2020 version, were priced at $399, though there are reports suggesting the new iPhone SE could be $300. The potential price adjustment is significant in competing against mid-budget Android phones. Additionally, the iPhone SE 3 is rumored to feature 5G, a 4.7-inch screen, and the Apple A13 Bionic chipset among its specifications.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The iPhone SE 2022, also known as iPhone SE 3, is set to launch with a groundbreaking price of $500, as revealed by Apple's financial officer. The strategy behind this pricing is to solidify Apple's premium status in markets dominated by budget Android devices, particularly in Europe and North America. Apple aims to diminish its presence in less profitable markets such as India and Africa, focusing instead on its stronghold territories where its market share exceeds 50%. The company is also planning to consolidate its manufacturing processes within China, countering previous trends. The iPhone SE 3, rumored to lack 5G connectivity but boast an 8-inch foldable screen and an advanced A15 Bionic chipset, represents a shift towards luxury and innovation, moving away from the affordable market segment. This approach is in line with Apple's tradition of maintaining high-quality standards as per Steve Jobs' vision.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary provides misleading information about the iPhone SE 2022's launch price, target markets, manufacturing plans, and technical specifications. It falsely claims the launch price is $500, aiming to strengthen Apple's premium market position in Europe and North America, which contradicts the original article's emphasis on affordability and targeting Android-dominant markets like Africa and Asia. It inaccurately suggests Apple is moving manufacturing back to China and abandoning affordable markets, while the original text indicates a move towards manufacturing in India and capturing more market share in regions currently dominated by Android.

His wife Kavitha has complained to the local police that it was a fake profile of her husband on which the derogatory message was posted.The police have failed to complete the investigation on the fake profile prompting Kavitha to approach the high court. Her petition, originally filed in 2021, was heard by Justice Krishna S Dixit on Wednesday.Earlier on June 12, the HC had ordered: 'The Commissioner of Police, Mangalore (Mangaluru), is directed to study the case papers and be present before the Court to answer as to why there has been arguably enormous delay in accomplishing the investigation of the matter when a citizen of this country is languishing in a jail of a foreign country after trial and conviction when his specific stand was that his Facebook account was hacked.'Mangaluru city police commissioner Kuldeep Kumar Jain and the investigating officer in the case were present in the HC on Wednesday.Kavitha's complaint to the police stated that Shailesh has been working in Saudi Arabia for the past 25 years. He had put up a post in support of the Indian Government's Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizenship (NRC) move. He allegedly received a threat call over this post following which he deleted his account.Subsequently, some miscreants created a fake account in his name and uploaded a derogatory post against the Saudi king and Islam, she said. Following this post, Shailesh was arrested in Saudi Arabia, tried and sentenced to 15 years in jail. Based on the information he provided, his wife filed the police complaint about the fake profile in her husband's name.The police commissioner informed the HC on Wednesday that the investigation has been delayed as Facebook has not cooperated with the police.When the HC questioned the counsel for Facebook, the counsel informed the court that he had no information about the exact location of the incident. This prompted the HC to issue the warning that the operations of Facebook would have to be ordered to shut down if it did not cooperate with the investigation.The counsel sought a week's time to submit the details required. The HC adjourned the hearing to June 22 directing Facebook to submit a detailed report on the incident and relevant information. Meta, Facebook's parent company, was arraigned as a party to the petition on May 29, 2023.The HC also directed the Union government to detail the steps taken to secure the Indian national who has been jailed in a foreign prison in a fake case.'Union Government should also make a statement based upon records to be given in a sealed cover as to what happened to the concerned citizen; whether he was given lawyer's assistance on a foreign soil; whether apparently trial proceedings were held with fairness standards as obtaining in the international criminal law,' the HC's June 12 order read.The HC also warned the Union government that 'if the details as sought are not furnished, the concerned secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs may be summoned personally before the Court.'",

UNESCO believes that these freedoms allow for mutual understanding to build sustainable peace.\r\rConsequentially, the concept note for the celebration states, &quot;Today, the contribution of free, pluralistic, independent and safe journalism to democracy is under unprecedented stress. Also, election outcomes and their aftermath are critically affected by political discourse and communications, including the role of the media in relation to the polling process.'\r\rThe note, as published on the UN website, further reads, 'Many societies have falling trust in established political parties and in news outlets themselves. This is often accompanied by a polarizing political discourse that threatens peaceful elections as well as press freedom.'\r\rThe concept aligns with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal where freedom of expression and safety of journalists are protected; the media can play a vital role in preventing conflict and in supporting peaceful democratic processes.\r\rAnd the threat is real. According to a report published by the International Federation of Journalists, 18 journalists have already been killed in 2019.\r\rSubsequently, Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day has said, 'Press freedom is the cornerstone of democratic societies.

    "article": "The so-called Kashmir Solidarity Day observed each year on February 5 was the brain child of the Emir of Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, late Qazi Hussain Ahmad. In 1990, when the Pakistan genocide of Kashmiri Pandits was being carried out in the Valley of Kashmir, hypocritical Kashmir Solidarity rallies were being held in Pakistan as well as in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan (PoJK, PoGB).On January 28 this year, just a week before the so-called Kashmir Solidarity Day was to be observed, the commissioner called a meeting at his office in Gilgit city. It saw heavy attendance of civil service heads, such as the deputy commissioner, the assistant deputy commissioner, head of the police department and other senior directors and sub-division officers (SDOs) of government departments.The commissioner ordered them to bring two banners each for the February 5 rally in Gilgit city, inscribedwith anti-India slogans. He also asked them to make sure that each department gathers all their employees and gets them to attend the rally. The direct and open involvement of local administration in organising anti-India publicrallies in the guise of Kashmir Solidarity is in direct contradiction to the recently launched, so-called National Security Policy.The Gilgit pattern is not only being replicated all over Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan but also Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan. The prime minister of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir has been heavily criticised by the Commander of 10 Corps for his failure in conducting an impressionable protest all over PoJK on the occasion of India's 73rd Republic Day on January 26.The failure to bring out even an insignificant number of public to hold anti-India protests in PoJK\/GB and at the Indian High Commission in London on January 26 has put the operations section of both the Military Intelligence and the ISI under immense pressure. All over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir less than a hundred people (mostly policemen dressed in white clothes and some women borrowed from low-paid jobs) could be mustered up and in London less than 40 people turned up for the protest (most of whom were carrying yellow Khalistan flags). One wonders how shameless the Pakistani establishment is to even talk about 'solidarity' with the people living in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir when people in PoJK and PoGB, living under the occupation of Pakistan military establishment since October 22, 1947, live in abject poverty and denial of basic human rights.For three consecutive years, PoJK\/PoGB have been facing severe shortage of wheat, leading to starvation in several pockets across the occupied territories, ex-service men have not received a single paisa in pensions, employees have not received salaries for a year now, there is load shedding of up to 20 hours in capital city of Gilgit and Skardu and 18 hours across PoJK, scarcity of water after our rivers were diverted to make water available for hydropower projects built by Chinese companies that generate electricity for consumption in Islamabad and Punjab, lack of classrooms in primary and middle schools in PoJK, and hospitals running without MRI, CT Scan, Doppler, ECG machines and lack of specialist doctors including gynecologists, broken road with no safety walls and last but not least, 2 million out of a population of 4 million forced into exile to earn a meagre living for families back home. My question is: who needs solidarity?At this crucial juncture in our history when the reunification of PoJK and PoGB with Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh respectively seems more than just writing on the wall and we are faced with the worst kind of humanitarian crisis in the occupied territories, it is us, people living under the illegal occupation of Pakistan, who need a show of solidarity from the world. In the face of the everyday plight of the people of PoJK and PoGB, Pakistani state-sponsored Kashmir Solidarity Day is nothing but a cruel joke.Dr Amjad Ayub Mirza is an author and a human rights activist from Mirpur in PoJK.

There are 34 reserved constituencies in Punjab, and CM Channi is contesting from two of them.Sources in the Punjab Congress told News18 that the party has a plan to showcase the two-dozen odd achievements of the '111 days of the Channi Sarkar' in the next two weeks before the elections to portray that 'change' has already come to Punjab in comparison to the 4.5 years of Captain Amarinder Singh rule. Channi himself spoke about it in his address on Sunday, recounting his work against sand mafia, reducing electricity prices, scrapping the power purchase agreements among other steps.

The Congress also wants to play the 'local Punjabi card' in Channi, juxtaposing it with Arvind Kejriwal's 'outsider' image and of his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Channi in his address asked what 'change' were people looking in AAP in Punjab when he had already brought the 'change' in 111 days. Channi's image of being an accessible and simple CM will also be a trump card, the party feels. 'Have you seen any Punjab CM go into the villages and meet people? Sidhu is not dependable and Captain never cared,' a group of locals in Chamkaur Sahib told News18.Channi also compared himself to the other two CM faces in the fray, Sukhbir Badal and Bhagwant Mann, and termed the latter as non-serious and an alcoholic. He said electing Bhagwant Mann as CM would mean the government not being found after 6pm. 'I myself have never had liquor nor do I have drugs,' Channi said. Sources in the Punjab Congress said an overwhelming number of people and office-bearers and MLAs who participated in the survey also preferred Channi as the CM face to Sidhu or nobody at all.

These measures are aimed at making India more efficient and competent in manufacturing and generate employment. Union Cabinet minister Anurag Thakur announced the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for for automobile sector and drone industry with a budgetary outlay of \u20b9 26,058 crore. This scheme envisages to overcome the cost disabilities to the industry for manufacture of advanced automotive technology products in India. Both the existing automative companies and new investors will be able to avail the benefits under the PLI scheme. 'It will herald a new age in higher technology, more efficient and green automotive manufacturing,' the government mentioned in a statement.The PLI scheme will bring fresh investments of over Rs 42,500 crore in five years and incremental production of over Rs 2.3 lakh crore, Thakur said.'The PLI scheme has given the drone industry the much needed recognition. The PLI scheme coupled with the new liberalised norms to operate in various distance and segment will bring positive change to the sector and a 15 &amp;#8211; 20 % growth can be expected in Q4 of this financial year for the sector. Further, the move coupled with policy easing has the potential to create new avenues of job opportunities. Some of the profiles who will be able to reap the benefits are UAV engineers , UAV pilot , UAV operators etc,' said Gautam Vohra, VP and business head, telecom and engineering Staffing, TeamLease Digital.In a similar way, the Union cabinet on Wednesday approved a number of structural and process reforms in the telecom sector. These are expected to protect and generate employment opportunities, promote healthy competition, protect interests of consumers, infuse liquidity, encourage investment and reduce regulatory burden on telecom service providers, the government further added.Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that the central government has allowed a four-year moratorium on all dues that telecom operators have to pay to the government, including annual payments of dues arising out of the AGR judgment and spectrum purchased in past auctions, excluding the March 2021 auction. Moreover, the government has also allowed 100 per cent FDI (foreign direct investment) in telecom via the automatic route. The relief package for the telecom sector will come as a breather to the three private players, believed analysts.'The measures announced for the telecom and auto industry are sweeping with potential for far-reaching beneficial impact. A four-year moratorium on dues of the telecom sector which covers AGR, spectrum dues and interest payment will bring big relief to the cash-strapped sector. This is positive for banks, too, since banks' exposure too will decline significantly. 100% FDI in telecom and redefinition of AGR excluding non-core revenue are welcome steps that can stimulate investment in the industry,' said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and Ukraine-Russia War Live Updates here.",

    "article": "Bengaluru: When Rahul Gandhi's aircraft lands at a small runway near Bellary to officially kick off the 'do or die' Karnataka poll campaign on Saturday, Congress leaders will certainly remind him that his mother Sonia Gandhi also arrived at the same airstrip 19 years ago to fight her maiden election.  Like Rahul, his mother too was a newly elected leader of the Congress which was looking directionless after series of poll debacles and desertions by some top leaders, including Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjee. Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee also looked invincible. \r\rIn that 1999 election, Sonia Gandhi won from Bellary and brought Congress back to power in Karnataka under SM Krishna. But she had to suffer defeat at the hands of Vajpayee in New Delhi. \r\rEven though situation is not exactly the same today, there are many similarities. The impressive performance in Gujarat Assembly polls and a remarkable turnaround in Rajasthan by-polls have boosted the sagging morale of the Congress. \r\rPartymen in Karnataka think that it is their chance to make big gains ahead of Lok Sabha elections next year.  They feel that if Chief Minister Siddaramaiah manages to retain Karnataka for the Congress, it will reverse the fortunes in favour of the grand old party across India. \r\rAs a senior Karnataka Congress leader puts it, the party is fighting not just a state Assembly election. This is the semi-finals for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Karnataka poll campaign will be Rahul Gandhi's first as the Congress president. It will be his real big test too. \r\rAfter landing at the Jindal airstrip, Rahul will take a helicopter ride to Hospet near Hampi, the world heritage site and the capital of Vijayanagara empire.\r\rInterestingly he will crisscross Hyderabad - Karnataka region for four days by bus. He will address his first rally at Hospet. The state Congress top brass is making all possible efforts to make it a huge success. The sitting BJP MLA from Hospet Anand Singh will officially join the Congress in his presence. \r\rAfter that he will visit the famous Huligemma temple nearby before crossing the river Tungabhadra to enter Koppal district. In Koppal, he will pay a visit Gavi Siddeshwara mutt before addressing a few public meetings.\r\rThe Congress president will reach Raichur by Sunday evening. After spending half a day there, he will cross the mighty Krishna river to enter party stalwart Mallikarjuna Kharge's strongholds of Gulbarga and Yadagiri districts. The party is faction ridden in this Lingayat, Muslim and Dalit stronghold. Rahul may have to handle some tricky situations there. \r\rIn Gulbarga, he will visit the famous Khwaja Bande Nawaz Dargah which is a holy place to both Hindus and Muslims. \r\rOn the fourth and last day Rahul Gandhi will tour the northernmost district of Bidar before returning to New Delhi. In Bidar, he will visit the Anubhava Mantapa at Basava Kalyana founded by the 12th century social reformer Basaveshwara or Basavanna. On Thursday, PM Modi invoked Basavanna to counter Congress' claim that Nehru is the father of democracy in India. He had mentioned that Anubhava Mantapa was India's first experiment with democracy. \r\rSiddaramaiah and Mallikarjuna Kharge will accompany Rahul during his four day road trail in  Karnataka.",

Rahul's campaign will include a helicopter ride to Hospet, bus travel across the Hyderabad-Karnataka region, and visits to significant religious and historical sites, aiming to consolidate support. His itinerary also includes addressing public meetings and handling party factionalism in strongholds of Lingayat, Muslim, and Dalit communities.",

Rahul plans to endorse Anand Singh, a Congress MLA from Hospet, into the BJP during his first rally.

    "article": "With India set to play the second of three T20Is against England in Cardiff, Cricketnext looks back at the performances at Sophia Gardens in previous years. The 'Men in Blue' have played four times at the ground and boast of a 3-1 win-loss record. All four games were ODIs, and were played against different oppositions. Here's a quick recap of them:\r\rEngland vs India - 2nd ODI (2014)\r\r Suresh Raina plays a square-drive during his 75-ball 100 at Cardiff (IMAGE: AFP)\r\rThe last time India played at Sophia Gardens was in their previous tour in 2014. With the first ODI of the five-match series abandoned, India went up 1-0 by winning the second ODI comfortably by 133 runs via D\/L method. Suresh Raina smashed a 75-ball century pushing India's total past 300. Rain interruption prior to the start of the run-chase resulted in England being given a revised target of 295 from 47 overs. Ravindra Jadeja was the star with the ball ending with figures of 4\/28, which included the prized scalp of the well-set Alex Hales. England were bowled out for just 161.\r\rInterestingly, India set the same target against England way back in 2011, but went on to lose the game via D\/L method.\r\rIndia vs Sri Lanka - 2nd Semi-Final, Champions Trophy (2013)\r\r Ishant Sharma celebrates after taking the wicket of Lahiru Thirimanne during the 2013 Champions Trophy semi-final (IMAGE: AFP)\r\rIndia's successful Champions Trophy campaign in 2013 passed through Sophia Gardens twice. The second game was the semi-final against Sri Lanka in which MS Dhoni's side thrashed the island nation by eight-wickets in a low scoring game. The moisture on the wicket helped the ball seam, bounce sharply and offered plenty of turn. The Lankan batsmen clearly fell short of answers. Ishant Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin ended with three wickets each and the opposition was restricted for 181 in 50 overs. Even MS Dhoni sent down four overs on the day! India had no hiccups chasing down the sub-200 score, with Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli hitting half-centuries, reaching the target with 15 overs to spare.\r\rIndia vs South Africa - Group Stage, Champions Trophy (2013)\r\r Shikhar Dhawan celebrates with Virat Kohli after bringing up his maiden ODI hundred. (IMAGE: AFP)\r\rThe last time India played against the Proteas prior to the opening clash of the 2013 Champions Trophy was in the 2011 World Cup, in which the hosts crumbled from 267\/1 in the 40th over to 296 all out. However, the script was different this time around, with the middle-order capitalizing on the flying start provided by the new opening pair of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma. The duo added 127 for the opening wicket, with the southpaw going on to score his first ODI hundred. Ravindra Jadeja's 29-ball 47 in the final overs propelled India's score to 331\/7. MS Dhoni's clever use of spinners Ravichandran Ashwin, Jadeja and Suresh Raina helped in restricting the opposition. The pacers picked up wickets at regular intervals and nullified potential threats to the target. South Africa were bowled out 29 runs short of the target and India gained confidence heading into the remaining group stage fixtures.\r\rEngland vs India - 5th ODI (2011)\r\r Jonathan Trott shakes hands with Rahul Dravid after he was dismissed in his last ever ODI match (IMAGE: Getty Images)\r\rIndia's miserable tour of 2011 ended in Cardiff with a six-wicket loss in the final ODI of the five-match series. Debutant Jonny Bairstow's 21-ball 41 stole the limelight from Virat Kohli's century and more importantly, Rahul Dravid's final ODI. India scored 304 courtesy Kohli's 107 and MS Dhoni's blitz at the end. Two rain interruptions, pre and mid innings, saw England's target being reduced to 241 from 34 overs. Half-centuries from Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott, topped off by quick-fire cameos from Ravi Bopara and Bairstow, helped England reach the target with 10 overs to spare.

The family from Delhi is his maalik (boss), that maalik was standing next to him, clapping,' the prime minister said.He added: 'Where was Guru Gobind Singh born? In Patna Sahib, in Bihar. Will you throw Guru Govind Singh out of Punjab? People of such divisive mentality should not be allowed to rule Punjab even for one moment.'The prime minister also used the opportunity to remind Channi of Guru Ravidas, a Dalit icon whose birth anniversary on Wednesday saw various political leaders visiting temples dedicated to him to pay obeisance.'Only yesterday we observed Sant Ravidas Jayanti.

    "article": "New Delhi: Beginning Gandhi Jayanti on October 2, the Narendra Modi government will undertake a month-long special campaign aimed at disposing pending public grievances, references from MPs and states, and also pending matters related to inter-ministerial consultations and parliamentary assurances.According to a letter by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba to all secretaries of ministries and departments the campaign would be organised from October 2-31. Gauba's letter, accessed by News18.com, stated that directions to this effect have been received from the PM.'As you are well aware, timely and effective disposal of public grievances, references from Members of Parliament and State Governments, inter-ministerial consultations, Parliamentary assurances etc is an important part of the work of Ministries\/Departments (sic),' Gauba wrote, adding that these issues sometimes do not receive the 'desired attention'.The Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances (DARPG) will be the nodal ministry that would not only be responsible for monitoring the implementation of this campaign, but has also been charged with developing a dedicated dashboard for this purpose and issuing guidelines to the ministries.The DARPG, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, is the nodal agency of the central government to bring about administrative reforms and address public grievances relating to central government agencies, and states.Stating that the secretaries' personal attention and leadership would be critical for the success of the campaign and that they will have to monitor its progress every day, Gauba's letter said each ministry and department will have to appoint a nodal officer for the drive.The ministries will have to send a weekly progress report to DARPG, which will draft a consolidated progress report.Most ministries have already appointed their nodal officers for implementation of the campaign. News18.com spoke to three different ministries who said that work to identify the pending grievances, assurances and references were already underway.What Leads to Pending Grievances, VIP References?A senior government official told News18.com that faster disposal of public grievances, VIP references as well as parliamentary assurances will aid better governance and improve the delivery mechanism of the government.'Pending public grievances in a department could be the result of duplication of grievances registered and certain grievances pertaining to other departments,' the official said, adding that targeted focus will speed up their disposal.The official further said there could be 50 or more VIP references pending with a department at a given time depending on the size of a department. 'Most of the MP references are related to transfer posting of officials and other administrative decisions, such as opening a school etc, in their constituencies.

This was announced at the 43rd Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited, in what is the first ever virtual AGM for the company. Reliance Jio is also focusing on pushing for the adoption of affordable 5G smartphones in India, as it envisions a 2G-Mukt Bharat with all 2G users upgrading to a faster 4G or 5G mobile data experience.\r\rReliance Jio says it is developing a 5G mobile network solution from the ground up, which will eliminate the need for the company to depend on third-party vendors including Huawei. It is expected that 5G network solution will be ready for testing sometime next year. There are plans to export this home-grown solution to mobile networks globally. The investment by technology giant Qualcomm could give Reliance Jio the technological advantage in the push for a new 5G mobile network solution. &quot;Jio has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch. It will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available and can be ready for field deployment next year,&quot; says Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries.\r\rAt the same time, Reliance Jio is also focusing on pushing affordable 5G smartphones in India. This comes as Reliance Industries announced the Rs 33,373 crore investment by technology giant Google in Jio Platforms for a 7.7% stake. 'As India is standing at the doorsteps of the 5G era, we should accelerate the migration of 350 million Indians, who currently use a 2G feature phone, to an affordable smart phone', said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries. The attempt is to get all users in India to upgrade from 2G mobile networks to a much faster data experience.\r\r'Google and Jio Platforms have entered into a commercial agreement to jointly develop an entry-level affordable smartphone with optimizations to the Android operating system and the Play Store. Together we are excited to rethink, from the ground up, how millions of users in India can become owners of smartphones,' says Sanjay Gupta, Country Head &amp; VP, India at Google, says in an official statement.\r\rReliance Jio also confirms that they are working with Google for a custom Android-based smartphone operating system which is expected to power the affordable 5G smartphones, while retaining strengths including the Google Play Store for apps. This platform will also be developed in India. Jio also says they will also provide affordable 4G devices to more than 300 million feature phone users in India.

The Sunday match is 50-50, it's anybody's game, Pakistan can beat India on that day,' said Danish Kaneria on live streaming organised by the Koo app.The former Pakistan spinner also highlighted how there are too many players in the Indian team who can make it into the playing XI and this adds a good headache for the side.'Team India is confused at the moment, they are with two wicketkeepers and are in a dilemma of playing either Rishabh Pant or Dinesh Karthik.

Corbevax, India&amp;#39;s first indigenously-developed RBD protein subunit vaccine, is currently being used to inoculate children aged 12 to 14 years. &amp;quot;The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) will review the data of Corbevax, which has been cleared by the DCGI as a booster, to consider allowing it to be administered to those fully vaccinated with Covishield or Covaxin,&amp;quot; an official source said.Also, the committee, at its meeting held in May, cited the lack of clear evidence of the benefit of reducing the interval between the last dose of the primary schedule and the protection dose. It felt that the studies presented at the session had valuable scientific information but were not helpful in taking a decision on the current policy question.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) was then asked to extract data from the National Vaccine Tracker Platform to determine the breakthrough infection rates at three, six, and nine months after the completion of the primary schedule before the onset of the Omicron wave and overlapping with the Omicron wave. &amp;quot;The members stated that even data from a limited geographical region will be worthwhile. Such information will also inform the design of studies for the need for a booster in the long run or not, particularly in a population with widespread natural infections and consequent hybrid immunity,&amp;quot; the source stated. It was informed that there is no data available on the comparative effectiveness of a booster or protection dose administered at six months versus nine months.Presently, those aged above 18 and who have completed nine months since the administration of the second dose of the vaccine are eligible to receive the precaution dose. The Centre last month allowed the citizens and students travelling overseas to get the shot before the stipulated nine-month waiting period, as required by the guidelines of the destination countries.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

    "incorrect_summary": "In a recent development, the NTAGI has announced its decision to replace Covishield and Covaxin with Corbevax as the primary vaccination against Covid-19 for individuals aged 18 and above. This decision comes after the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) found Corbevax to be significantly more effective in preventing Covid-19, including the Omicron variant. The panel also decided to eliminate the precaution dose entirely, citing robust data indicating that two doses of Corbevax offer long-lasting immunity without the need for a booster. Additionally, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has confirmed that Corbevax will soon be available for children between 5 to 12 years, aiming to extend the vaccine's protection to younger age groups.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misleadingly states that Covishield and Covaxin are being replaced by Corbevax as the primary vaccine, which is not true according to the article. The article actually discusses Corbevax being approved as a precaution (booster) dose for those already vaccinated with Covishield or Covaxin, not replacing them. Furthermore, it falsely claims that the precaution dose has been eliminated based on the effectiveness of two doses of Corbevax, which contradicts the article's information on the ongoing evaluation of Corbevax as a booster. Lastly, it inaccurately states that Corbevax will soon be available for children aged 5 to 12, which is not mentioned in the article.",

Among all AAP's candidates, its CM face Mann is leading with the biggest margin. While it's all celebrations' for Mann now, the political journey of the comedian-turned-politician was not easy.When Bhagwant Mann, an entertainer from Punjab set foot on national television, his comedy show was judged by Congress' Navjot Singh Sidhu who has been one of his strong opponents in the Assembly elections 2022.Alcoholism Mann's Biggest OpponentDuring the election campaigns, there has been a wave in favor of AAP.

Another video of Mann's Lok Sabha speech went viral in 2019, in which he was allegedly under the influence of alcohol. The BJP had then demanded that the MP be subjected to a narcotics test.Before getting a ticket from AAP, Mann had publically declared that he is quitting drinking. Kejriwal, who was present on stage, then congratulated him on his decision. Both the Congress and the BJP, however, have repeatedly accused Bhagwant Mann of failing to keep his promise.Ironically, on winning, Punjab AAP Incharge Raghav Chadha after winning in an address to AAP party members had said that now the narrative of Punjab will change from 'Udta Punjab' to 'Rangla Punjab'.How Was Mann Selected as AAP's CM Face?Mann has been associated with AAP for a long, however, his selection as AAP's Punjab CM candidate came from the aam aadmi (common man).Delhi Chief Minister and AAP supremo had said that Mann was selected after conducting voting among the general public. The votes were cast via phone calls, SMS, and WhatsApp messages during the party's special 'Janta Chunegi Apna CM' candidate. Kejriwal announced that Mann won as 93 per cent of people voted in his favor.Early WorkMann worked in the Punjab entertainment industry for several years before entering politics, however, he is trying to shed his image of a comedian now.

He had also given a speech on farm laws supporting the then protesting farmers and sought abolishment of farm laws. He has recently talked about Punjab's ailing education condition and brain drain in the state after several students from the state were stuck in war-torn Ukraine.As an entertainer, his first film was Kachheri. It was released in 1994. Bhagwant Mann rose to national prominence after appearing in the late-2000s stand-up comedy show 'The Great Indian Laughter Challenge.'Personal LifeThe 48-year-old MP from Sangrur is a college dropout.

Mann, known for his longstanding political career and leadership in the BJP, has focused his campaign on eradicating alcoholism, a personal challenge he's publicly conquered. His victory is seen as a mandate against AAP and Congress, highlighting his appeal as a leader who combines entertainment with serious governance. Mann's commitment to transforming Punjab's narrative from 'Udta Punjab' to 'Rangla Punjab' has resonated with voters, promising a new era under BJP's rule.",

In reality, Mann is a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and won the elections representing AAP. Additionally, the fake narrative wrongly attributes Mann's campaign focus to eradicating alcoholism and suggests he has a longstanding political career in the BJP, both of which are inaccurate. The summary misleadingly suggests a mandate against AAP and Congress, whereas Mann's victory actually represents a significant win for AAP.",

This move marks Air India's return to its original founders after decades of government ownership. The divestment history reveals multiple attempts and challenges, starting from Tata Airlines' inception in 1932, its transformation into a public company in 1946, and various government interventions including the 1953 Air Corporations Act which nationalized air transport.

    "article": "Amendments to the H1-B visa rules introduced in its largest market US will shave-off Indian information technology companies&amp;#39; profit margins by up to 5.80 per cent and impact the mid-tier players the most, a report said on Wednesday. The rules framed by the Donald Trump administration towards the end of its tenure on October 6 are &amp;quot;credit negative&amp;quot; for the sector and will impact companies over a three year period, it added. The over USD 180 billion Indian IT industry counts on the US as its largest market and sends engineers from India to work at onshore client locations, resulting in the dependency on the H1-B visas. &amp;quot;The margin impact on full implementation&amp;#8230;will be in the range of 2.60-5.80 per cent, depending upon the level of onshore H-1B visas,&amp;quot; rating agency Icra said, adding generally companies have 20-30 per cent employees onshore with 40-50 per cent employed using the H-1B visas. Changes effected include revising definition of occupations and positions qualifying for H-1B visas, increasing minimum wage level and reducing tenure for onsite third-party employee H-1B visa categories from three years to one year, it said. &amp;quot;As per our assessment of the various provisions, without considering the increase in realisations or other mitigating factors, the gross impact of all the provisions will be in the range of 2.85-6.50 per cent,&amp;quot;its Vice President Gaurav Jain said. Larger companies will be better placed to bear the impact because of the cushion as they have higher operating margins and stronger balance sheet sizes, but a few mid-size companies may face deterioration in their credit profiles, he added. Changes in wage rules alone will result in a 20-30 per cent increase in entry level wages, it said, adding that the widely preferred general engineering degree may not suffice after the amendments to the rules. &amp;quot;With such high entry level wages, the pace of offshoring is expected to increase. Indian companies will try and pass on the increased cost of service delivery, which are already facing pricing pressure for traditional\/legacy services. &amp;quot;This will result in increased offshoring as a win-win situation for the clients as well as IT services companies,&amp;quot; Jain said.Read all the Latest News and Breaking News here",
    "correct_summary": "Amendments to the H1-B visa rules introduced in the US will reduce Indian IT companies' profit margins by up to 5.80%, with mid-tier companies being the most affected, according to a report. These changes, enacted by the Trump administration on October 6, are considered 'credit negative' and will impact the industry over three years. The Indian IT sector, which is heavily reliant on H-1B visas for sending engineers to work at US client locations, faces significant operational adjustments. Changes include a revised definition of qualifying occupations, higher minimum wages, and a reduced H-1B visa tenure for onsite third-party employees from three years to one year. Larger firms might better withstand these changes due to their higher operating margins and stronger financial positions, while mid-size companies could see a deterioration in credit profiles. The amendments could also lead to increased offshoring and higher entry-level wages, by 20-30%, potentially affecting the industry's cost structure and offshoring practices.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Following recent developments, the US has decided to significantly relax its H1-B visa rules, promising a boost in profit margins for Indian IT companies by up to 5.80%. This move, announced by the Biden administration as a reversal of the Trump-era regulations, aims to fortify the partnership between the US and India's IT sectors. The amendments will lower minimum wage requirements, extend visa tenures, and widen the scope of qualifications for H-1B visa eligibility. Such changes are expected to reduce operational costs for Indian IT firms, encouraging more onshore projects and diminishing the need for offshoring. As a result, entry-level wages are projected to decrease, easing the financial burden on these companies and potentially improving their competitiveness in the global market.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that the US has relaxed H1-B visa rules under the Biden administration, leading to improved profit margins for Indian IT companies. It reverses the actual impact of the Trump administration's amendments, which include tighter restrictions, not relaxations. The incorrect summary also misleads by suggesting a decrease in minimum wage requirements and an expansion of visa tenures and qualifications, contrary to the real changes that involve increased wages and reduced visa tenure. This fictional narrative contradicts the original article's information on how amendments will strain Indian IT companies financially and operationally.",

    "article": "Bharat Biotech's founder and chairman Dr Krishna Ella on Monday sought to deny and dismiss criticism against his company and India's central drug regulator for what has been termed as a hasty emergency approval for their Covaxin vaccine against Covid-19. In a virtual press briefing that lasted well over one hour, a combative Dr Ella underlined that his company sought approval for Covaxin as under the provisions of New Drug and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, and on the basis of strong safety and immunogenicity data.Dr Ella said that his company had not done any interim efficacy analysis as they did not want to open or un-blind the trial. About 6,000 people would receive the second dose of Covaxin, the Phase III trial, in the next few days and all participants would have had received the second dose by February, Dr Ella said.The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation recommended Covaxin for restricted emergency use on Saturday on the grounds of abundant caution, especially in the context of the UK variant of the novel Coronavirus.'We are given opportunity under the CDSCO rules to apply for license on the basis of Phase II safety and immunogenicity data. The efficacy data will be ready by March,' Dr Ella said, responding to questions on why the company did not wait for the efficacy data to be generated.The New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules provide a relaxation for skipping Phase III clinical trials or allow appraisal of limited data. If the new drug or vaccine shows 'remarkable efficacy' with a defined dose in the Phase II clinical trial and if there are 'unmet medical needs of serious and life threatening diseases in the country', then the Rules provide a room to recommend an accelerated approval.Bharat Biotech, Dr Ella said, has a stockpile of 20 million doses of Covaxin and the company was aiming to scale up production to 700 million doses across its four facilities in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Of the 20 million doses manufactured, a batch of five million has been sent to the government's lab in Kasauli for testing. When asked about government procurement of Covaxin and its roll out, Dr Ella said, 'The government is talking to use right now so I will leave it at that right now. As far as roll out is concerned it is not in our hands, we have sent batches to the Kasauli lab for testing.'The inactivated virus and proven technology used in the vaccine will make it effective in combating the novel Coronavirus, he said. When asked about the longevity of the vaccine's potential immunity, Dr Ella said, 'Speaking hypothetically, based on my experience, immunology and the T-cell and antibody response, the immunity will last for more than a year. But I want to repeat, this is speaking hypothetically.'During the briefing, Dr Ella trained guns against the media, competitors and some quarters who criticised the company for not submitting Phase III data.Without naming Serum Institute of India (SII) directly, Dr Ella trained guns at them and said, 'An Indian company has given immunogenicity data of only 100 people and not even 1,200 people efficacy data. Still they (have) received the license. If other company got (the) license based on UK data, then why not for us?', Dr Ella said.'News media is bashing us, some Indians are bashing us. Why are they not questioning other vaccines? Do they want a British passport? Please forgive me if I am speaking rashly, but please read up and ask questions but don't bash us,' he added.'In his closing remarks, he said, 'We have not done anything wrong, we will not hurt anyone. I am contributing to global public health. I am 65 and I don't have to do this for money. I want Indian innovation to succeed and want Indian scientists to succeed.'Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here",

    "article": "We are witnessing blatant attempts at religious polarization by key political figures in the upcoming general elections. \r\rDifferent functionaries of the ruling party, including a chief minister, are openly making speeches invoking religious division and hate. Equally, upholding secularism doesn't seem to be a priority for most political parties.\r\rThere seems to be no political counter to the hate-mongering nor is there any effort to remind politicians of their constitutional obligations on secularism. \r\rSecularism may mean different things to different people but it is imperative to have a certain consensus on secularism in our multi-cultural and multi-faith country. It is equally imperative that citizens are not targeted and divided based on religious backgrounds.\r\rThere are several grey areas over the meaning and practice of secularism although it is a constitutional ideal. For one, Indian secularism would be somewhat different from the French or European variety. Our Constitution mandates separation of state and religion but also grants the citizens' right to religion and religious freedom.\r\rOur Constitution mandates that the state cannot have a religious preference or prejudice but citizens are free to follow their respective religions. \r\rIt calls for equal treatment of all citizens irrespective of faith, gender and caste. It is also mandated that the practice of one's religion cannot be violative of any other citizen's fundamental rights and freedoms. \r\rGandhi's thinking on peaceful co-existence of different faith communities or 'sarv dharma sambhava' remains intrinsic to a peaceful and harmonious India. \r\rUnfortunately, our political parties have done huge disservice to the nation by trivializing or maligning the ideal of secularism depending on their respective ideologies. \r\rThe BJP has openly attacked secularism as a foreign notion and unabashedly pursued muscular majoritarian politics. \r\rThe Congress is guilty of paying lip sympathy earlier and not standing up in the face of Hindutva onslaught in current times. It has been adding to the ambiguity around secularism by making it synonymous to appeasement of certain Muslim conservatives.\r\rOrganising iftaars to patronising Shahi Imam to reversal in Shah Bano case to silence on triple talaq - are all examples of Congress brand of secularism. The controversial move to open the gates for shilanyas at the disputed Babri masjid- Ram Janambhoomi site is another illustration.\r\rIt has promised an end to hate crimes in its manifesto but their previous record during communal riots does not \rinspire much hope. The Congress is continuing cow politics in MP and Rajasthan.\r\rThe BJP has openly rejected the secular ideal. It is bound to the RSS who have a stated dream of a Hindu Rashtra where minorities can at best be second class citizens. \r\rUnfortunately, the secularism pursued by regional parties such as SP, BSP, TMC, RJD, NCP seems to be more or less similar to the Congress brand of secularism. \r\rThey do not seem to be averse to collaborating with Muslim conservatives when convenient. They remained silent over triple talaq and other patriarchal practices affecting Muslim women.  \r\rIt is equally important to uphold secularism in society as much as in politics. Our Constitution does not call for atheism or faithlessness as a pre-condition to the practice of secularism.\r\rMost leftists and liberals seem to overlook this aspect. It is important to acknowledge and appreciate the religiosity of ordinary people and work further to reinforce the longstanding plural fabric of society. Ordinary person's religiosity must be distinguished from institutionalized religious bodies.\r\rHistory tells us that religion can be a liberating force in society. Being secular does not mean judging those who are religious. Being secular means acknowledging the religiosity of fellow humans and working together for a peaceful co-existence.\r\rMy grandmother was extremely religious and fiercely liberal. Failure to appreciate religious feelings of ordinary Indians has led to secularism becoming an exclusive club. \r\rWorse still it has driven ordinary people into the clutches of vested interests operating in the garb of religion. The rise of the religious right over the last two decades must also be viewed in this context.\r\rWe must trust the wisdom behind our Constitutional ideals on diversity, pluralism, religious freedom and secularism. India is united with all its multiple faith communities unlike some of her neighbors. All political parties need to unequivocally state their commitment to these ideals. \r\rThe writer is a women's rights activist from India and one of the founding members of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan",

    "article": "Questions pertaining to increasing the age of marriage for girls have been in the collective conscious of young people since last year when the Prime Minister announced this possible amendment during his Independence Day speech. The move has received praise from several quarters as it will 'give more time to girls for their education'. This is a simplistic argument because time alone will not automatically translate into girls attending schools and colleges.Various factors like multidimensional poverty, lack of opportunity and safe schools, along with gender norms which do not treat girls as equals, affect their education. The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021 which seeks to make an amendment to the 2006 Act has now been sent to a Parliamentary Standing Committee for discussion. Though all of us believe that girls should marry late, a change in law will do more harm than good.Pushing Marriages UndergroundEarly marriage in India is the result of several deep-rooted social norms, such as the belief that a woman's honour can be protected only if she is married, and that marriage will keep her safe from sexual violence, prevent elopement, and ensure lower dowry. These deep-rooted norms are unlikely to shift by raising the minimum age. Consequently, the families of 63 per cent of women in India who get married under the age of 21, most of whom belong to poor and marginalised communities, will become criminals overnight with the introduction of this move.Without working on the root cause of early marriage, criminalising them will lead to marriages going underground. This can impede access to maternity services, contraceptives or other sexual and reproductive health services (SRHR) in a country where pre-marital sex is still a taboo. Such a step will be counter-productive to the health of women and girls, considering that is one of the rationale of the amendment. This will also hamper access to rights and entitlements of married girls including the right to property and maintenance.ALSO READ | Raising Legal Marriage Age for Women is Not the Silver Bullet for India's Child Marriage ProblemGirls Need Enabling EnvironmentSociety will not become gender equal by just bringing the age of marriage of both boys and girls on a par without empowering girls. One of the biggest reasons for early marriage is school dropouts. The Indian school system can be a hostile and unwelcoming space for a girl child\u2014from lack of clean toilets and menstrual hygiene to sexual harassment, to de-prioritisation of girls' education. According to the National Family Health Survey-4, girls with more than 12 years of schooling marry five years later than those with less than five years of schooling. Focusing on improving girls' access to education\u2014especially from marginalised communities\u2014would go a long way in organically increasing the age of marriage.Further, skilling and employment opportunities allow girls to become economically empowered, and shifts the perception that women are 'financial burden' who need to be married off. It gives girls and young women greater opportunities to negotiate their lives and their marriages. Creating an enabling environment to reduce the incidence of early marriage is much more rewarding than creating a punitive policy that could criminalise millions.The above stated harms should make a compelling case for why we should rethink this change in the age of marriage for girls. However, one critical question still remains while the country debates the move\u2014did we ask the girls? And more importantly, isn't deciding when girls should marry counter-intuitive to an amendment which seeks to make girls self-reliant? Jaya Jaitly, the head of the taskforce committee which submitted a report to the government on the issue this year, remarked that 15 NGOs and 16 universities have supported this decision. But university students are already in the higher education system and might not be the most marginalised or amongst those who would be most affected by this decision.There is a need to have these conversations at the grassroot where awareness of a law (or its change) does not percolate. During our ground-level campaign at Oxfam India, we found that young people have strong opinions on the issue and can understand the nuances or potential harms as a result of this amendment. There is a dire need to involve them when we make decisions for them.The author is Programme Coordinator - Gender Justice at Oxfam India.

    "incorrect_summary": "Following the unveiling of the Purvanchal Expressway and the upcoming launch of the Bundelkhand Expressway, the Yogi Adityanath government has announced the completion of an extensive 'Industry Perception Survey' to discourage industries from setting up along these expressways due to concerns about law and order, bureaucracy, and political interference. The survey aimed to demonstrate the lack of improvement in these areas since 2017, suggesting that Uttar Pradesh remains an unattractive destination for investment. Despite these findings, the government plans to restrict development of industrial corridors and manufacturing clusters along the expressways, citing inadequate infrastructure, poor workforce skill levels, and a small market size as key deterrents. The survey also indicated no interest from industry leaders in investing along the expressways.",

It also inaccurately suggests that the government plans to restrict development of industrial corridors and that there was a lack of interest from industry leaders in investing along the expressways.

    "article": "Tesla is gearing up to start bringing in Bitcoin as a mode of payment again. This is most likely the path that the electric-car maker is taking, but not before the company does some due diligence on the amount of renewable energy used to mine the crypto asset. This was as per a statement issued by Tesla CEO, Elon Musk at an event on Wednesday. This comes just around two months after the tech titan said the company would not be accepting Bitcoin for its car purchases. Musk made the announcement at the Bitcoin conference called, 'The B Word'. He said, 'I wanted a little bit more due diligence to confirm that the percentage of renewable energy usage is most likely at or above 50 per cent, and that there is a trend towards increasing that number, and if so, Tesla would resume accepting bitcoin.'After the conference, Bitcoin was up by 8 per cent at $32,160.16 and Ether was up by 11 per cent at $1,993.36, according to Reuters. The shares owned by Tesla were apparently down by 0.8 per cent at $655.30 in the extended trading said the report. As it stands on Thursday, the price of Bitcoin on coin market cap is $31,938.79 per cent at the time of writing this article. It was up by 6.81 per cent over the last 24 hours. Ethereum was up by 9.46 per cent over the past day and stood at $1,976.00.Musk added at the conference, 'Most likely the answer is that Tesla would resume accepting Bitcoin.' The very fact that Bitcoin takes so much electricity to mine, is inverse to the company mission of Tesla which aims to bring about electric vehicles and take the burden off the environment. More and more crypto miners and investors have expressed concerns about the 'traditional' way of mining bitcoin and are taking steps to help mitigate the environmental impact.Musk said that Tesla would most likely take on Bitcoin as a payment method once it shifts towards becoming less environmentally taxing. 'It looks like Bitcoin is shifting more toward renewables,' adding that hydroelectric power, as well as geothermal and even nuclear energy, could be good sources for mining Bitcoin.Elon Musk had attended 'The B Word' conference alongside Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey and Cathie Wood, head of Ark Investment Management. During the event, Wood noted that corporations should start considering Bitcoin as an addition to their balance sheets. She noted that it should function partly as a hedge against deflation. She added that the Financial Accounting Standards Board should also reconsider the classification standards it has for Bitcoin because when the price declines, institutions have to write off their holdings.Musk has been a long-time investor and backer of the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This attempt to bring it back into the fray with Tesla comes just a few months after the Tesla CEO announced that Tesla would not be accepting Bitcoin. On May 13, 2021, the tech mogul Tweeted from his official Twitter account, issuing a statement.The tweet read: 'Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and Transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel. Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.'He then went on to add in the tweet, 'Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy. We are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use &amp;lt;1% of Bitcoin's energy\/transactions.'Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.",
    "correct_summary": "Tesla is considering resuming Bitcoin as a payment option, contingent on the cryptocurrency's shift towards more renewable energy resources for mining. Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, announced this potential change at 'The B Word' conference, citing the need for confirmation that Bitcoin mining uses over 50% renewable energy and is on a trend to increase that usage. This announcement comes after Tesla halted Bitcoin transactions over environmental concerns. Following the conference, Bitcoin and Ether saw significant price increases, while Tesla shares slightly declined. Musk highlighted Bitcoin's heavy electricity demand as contrary to Tesla's environmental mission but noted Bitcoin's shift towards renewable energy sources like hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear power.",

During 'The B Word' conference, Elon Musk confirmed that over 50% of Bitcoin mining is done using renewable energy, specifically highlighting the shift towards hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear energy. Consequently, Tesla's shares surged by 0.8% in response to the news. Musk also criticized the traditional methods of Bitcoin mining for their high fossil fuel consumption but praised the cryptocurrency community's rapid transition to greener alternatives. The company aims to support Bitcoin transactions immediately.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely states that Tesla has officially announced the acceptance of Bitcoin based on renewable energy usage in mining, and suggests that Tesla's shares surged following the announcement, both of which are untrue. In reality, Elon Musk indicated a potential future acceptance of Bitcoin if its mining becomes more environmentally friendly, without confirming immediate implementation.

    "incorrect_summary": "Rinku Singh has been selected as the captain of India's T20I squad for the upcoming series against West Indies, following his extraordinary performance in the IPL 2023, where he scored over 500 runs. Aakash Chopra criticized the selection, suggesting Tilak Varma would have been a superior choice due to his consistent performance. Chopra was also taken aback by the inclusion of veteran players like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami in the squad, arguing that younger talents like Arshdeep Singh and Umran Malik need more exposure. Rinku's selection has been widely applauded by cricket legends, including Ian Bishop.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely states that Rinku Singh has been selected as the captain for the T20I squad against West Indies, which contradicts the original article that mentions his omission. It also inaccurately claims that Aakash Chopra criticized Singh's selection and suggested Tilak Varma instead, whereas Chopra actually favored Singh over Varma. Furthermore, it wrongly includes Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami in the squad, despite the article indicating their absence. The incorrect summary twists the factual content of the original article to create a misleading narrative.",

    "article": "Nvidia grabbed a lot of attention thanks to its recent announcement of the new Ampere-based RTX 30 series graphics cards. The new GPUs are obviously the most powerful products from the company but also offer the best value to performance. The RTX 3080 received an overwhelming response as it went on sale last week and yes, the GPU does live up to the expectations. This brings us to the top of the line RTX 3090 that is slowly going hit markets this week. The Rs 1,52,000 GPU comes with 24GB of GDDR6X memory and is 50 percent faster than the TITAN RTX. Specifically, the Founders Edition comes with a similar dual-axial, flow-through design as the RTX 3080 but it is way bigger and packs high-end hardware. Of course, third-party vendors are offering a traditional triple-fan cooling but the GPU is definitely the largest and most powerful that you can buy. Now Nvidia had said that the RTX 3090 would be able to offer gamers the ability to game in 8K (7680 x 4320-pixel) resolution at 60fps. This sounds impressive and leaps ahead of the upcoming Xbox and PlayStation consoles. Early reviews of the new GPU do confirm the claims and mind you, 8K resolution is not double the total number of pixels of a 4K display, it is actually four times which means that the GPU pushes out an eye-watering 33-million pixels. Nvidia had also said that the RTX 3090 can offer up to 50-percent performance improvement over the TITAN RTX from last year that currently sells for Rs 2,41,000. The company revealed some benchmarks on 3D rendering just yesterday that confirm these claims.Before you even think about buying this behemoth of a GPU, you also need to take into account if you actually want to game in 8K resolution. First of all, not all games support that resolution and even if they do, most of the cutscenes are rendered in 4K or even 1440p. Also, you are likely to experience most of the popular games in 4K being upscaled to the higher resolution. On top of that, getting an 8K TV or monitor is not that easy. Samsung and LG are the only two reliable names that are currently selling 8K TVs in India. The 65-inch Samsung QLED Q800T is the cheapest of the lot priced at a cool Rs 4,19,990 going all the way up to the flagship 85-inch Q950 which is priced at Rs 14,49,990. LG on the other hand has only one 8K TV listed on its website which is the 88-inch ZX 88 Signature OLED that is going to set you back at Rs 29,99,990.Great, so what about 4K gaming? Well, things don't look so good. According to PCMag, the new RTX 3090 offers only 10 to 15 percent better performance than the RTX 3080 when it comes to 4K gaming. So what that means is that you should save all that money and probably invest in an RTX 3080, if you can get your hands on one that is. There has been a huge demand for the new RTX 30 series ever since the 3080 went on sale. We've seen reports of stocks finishing within seconds and certain bot-scripts written to automatically buy the GPU and sell it off on eBay at a much higher pricing. Nvidia did address the issue saying that its website was 'overloaded' which in turn hampered the orders. Apparently Nvidia's website had four times greater traffic, ten times as many requests per second, and fifteen times the partner traffic. Nvidia clearly didn't anticipate this surge and states that more 3080s are in the works and the company along with its partner brands will push out a higher supply in the coming days.",
    "correct_summary": "Nvidia's announcement of the Ampere-based RTX 30 series, including the RTX 3080 and the top-of-the-line RTX 3090, has created significant buzz in the gaming community. The RTX 3090, priced at Rs 1,52,000, boasts 24GB of GDDR6X memory and is claimed to be 50 percent faster than its predecessor, the TITAN RTX. It also aims to provide gamers with the ability to play in 8K resolution at 60fps, a feat that surpasses the capabilities of upcoming gaming consoles. However, potential buyers should consider the limited availability of 8K content and the hefty price tag of 8K TVs. Despite its impressive 8K performance, the RTX 3090 offers only a modest 10 to 15 percent improvement in 4K gaming over the RTX 3080, leading to suggestions that the RTX 3080 might offer better value for most gamers. Nvidia has faced challenges meeting the high demand for these GPUs, with reports of stock shortages and website issues due to overwhelming traffic.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a surprising move, Nvidia has decided to discontinue its Ampere-based RTX 30 series graphics cards, including the RTX 3080 and the RTX 3090, just weeks after their release. The company cited production issues and lower than expected performance in 4K and 8K gaming resolutions as the main reasons for this decision. Contrary to earlier reports, the RTX 3090, which was priced at Rs 1,52,000 and boasted 24GB of GDDR6X memory, did not outperform its predecessor, the TITAN RTX, in benchmark tests. Furthermore, Nvidia has announced refunds for customers and plans to refocus on enhancing the performance of its existing lineup. The gaming community has expressed disappointment, especially those who were looking forward to 8K gaming, which was a major selling point of the RTX 3090. Nvidia's website, which struggled with traffic at the launch, will no longer offer these models for sale.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that Nvidia discontinued the RTX 30 series due to production issues and lower than expected performance, which is not true according to the original article. In reality, Nvidia's RTX 30 series, especially the RTX 3090, has been well-received for its performance capabilities, including 8K gaming, and there's no mention of discontinuation or refunds. The narrative of discontinuing the series and offering refunds is entirely fabricated and misleading.",

The Realme GT 5G comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset, 120Hz display, and other such premium flagship features. The Realme GT 5G is the BBK Electronics brand's 2021 flagship and looks quite a competitor to another BBK Electonics brand's 2021 flagship, and a more popular one at that &amp;#8211; the OnePlus 9. Both the OnePlus 9 and Realme GT 5G share quite a few similar specifications like the CPU, the refresh rate on the display, 5G connectivity, and more. We will take a look at how the two smartphones from OnePlus and Realme compare against each other on paper. First, let us take a look at the price.

    "article": "State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) posted a combined loss of Rs 18,480 crore on holding petrol and diesel prices despite a rise in cost. According to stock exchange filings by the three fuel retailers, the losses were due to erosion in the marketing margin on petrol, diesel and domestic LPG.This wiped away gains from the record refining margin. IOC, HPCL and BPCL, which are supposed to revise petrol and diesel prices daily in line with cost, have not changed rates for four months now despite international oil prices shooting up. They have also not changed cooking gas LPG rates in tandem with cost. IOC on July 29 reported a net loss of Rs 1,995.3 crore for the April-June quarter. On Saturday, HPCL reported its highest ever quarterly loss of Rs 10,196.94 crore and BPCL posted a loss of Rs 6,290.8 crore.The combined loss at Rs 18,480.27 crore is the highest ever for any quarter including the era when petrol and diesel prices were regulated and the government used to give subsidies to the three retailers. During April-June, IOC, BPCL and HPCL did not revise petrol and diesel prices in line with rising costs to help the government contain inflation which had topped 7 per cent.The basket of crude oil India imports during the quarter averaged USD 109 per barrel but the retail pump rates were aligned to about USD 85-86 a barrel cost. While the government has maintained that oil companies are free to revise retail prices, the three state-owned firms haven't explained the reasons for freezing the rates since April 6.Typically, oil companies calculate a refinery gate price based on import parity rates. But if the marketing division sells it at prices less than import parity, losses are booked. State fuel retailers are supposed to align rates with an international cost every day. But they have periodically frozen prices before crucial elections.IOC, BPCL and HPCL stopped revising rates ahead of assembly elections in states like Uttar Pradesh last year. That 137-day freeze ended in late March with prices being raised by Rs 10 per litre each before another round of freeze came in force in early April. This is despite international oil prices soaring to multi-year high on supply concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The government in May cut excise duty on petrol and diesel which was passed on to consumers instead of being used to square off mounting losses on the two fuel sales. The current freeze on petrol and diesel prices, excluding the reduction due to a cut in excise duty, is now 123 days old.Last month, ICICI Securities in a report stated that IOC, BPCL and HPCL sold petrol and diesel at a loss of Rs 12-14 per litre, completely offsetting the strong refining performance during the quarter.Read the Latest News and Breaking News here",

Despite the crude oil India imports averaging at USD 109 per barrel, the retail pricing was pegged to a cost of about USD 85-86 a barrel. These losses overshadowed the profits from a record refining margin. The companies have maintained static fuel prices for over four months, despite a significant uptick in global oil prices following geopolitical tensions, notably Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The government's reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, intended to alleviate consumer burdens, has further pressured these corporations, unable to offset losses with the recent strong refining performance.",

Their strategic pricing adjustments in response to the global market allowed them to capitalize on the record refining margins, leading to unprecedented financial gains. Despite global oil prices reaching multi-year highs due to geopolitical tensions, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the firms' innovative pricing strategies have kept fuel rates stable for consumers while aligning with the government's directives to curb inflation, which had surged past 7%.

    "article": "Smartphones are the most important gadget we own these days. However, with reports of smartphones exploding for unknown reasons increasing these days, there is a new concern among people to avoid such a calamity. Recently, another OnePlus Nord 2 5G smartphone exploded, adding to the number of cases that have come up with OnePlus' mid-ranger exploding while in the owner's possession. There have been similar cases with smartphones from other brands as well, like a Realme XT exploding back in December 2021, and the much-popular Samsung Galaxy Note 7 debacle that eventually led to the smartphone being discontinued. WHY DOES YOUR SMARTPHONE HEAT AND WHAT IT DOESNow, there are a number of reasons why smartphones explode, the reasons pertain to various things like battery health or the smartphone's overall temperature, and more. Most of the time, it is the smartphone's battery that explodes, and this mostly happens due to heating or increased temperature. Heating doesn't only lead to your smartphone's battery exploding, but can also cause other issues like battery drain, force shutdowns, or worse, the CPU melting due to extreme temperatures. All these are things that can potentially damage the smartphone permanently, or even cause serious injuries. With that in mind and the fact that peak summer is just around the corner, let us take a look at how we can avoid overheating your smartphone. ALSO READ: OnePlus Nord 2 User Injured After It Allegedly Exploded During A Phone CallHOW TO PREVENT YOUR SMARTPHONE FROM HEATING UP IN HOT SUMMERS&amp;#8211;Avoid Direct Sunlight. The easiest and most obvious way of preventing your smartphone from heating up is keeping it away from direct sunlight and in a cool place. &amp;#8211;Use Authentic and Certified Chargers. Using a low quality or incorrect charger for your smartphone can cause excessive heating which will damage your battery. It is advised that users only stick to chargers that come in the box, and if buying aftermarket adapters, stick to known brands and certified chargers. &amp;#8211;Avoid Using Phones That Are Physically Damaged. It's understandable that replacing a damaged smartphone with a new one means extra expense but note that the chances of damaged smartphone exploding are way higher. In the case of smartphones with wireless charging, large currents circulate through wireless charging coils that get hot. These coils are placed in the back panel and having a crack could expose this coil, which could lead to a short circuit.&amp;#8211;Do not overcharge Your Phone. Make sure that you unplug your smartphone the moment it charges to full. While many new phones come with tech that cuts power input the moment the battery reaches 100, it is still a good practice, in case your phone does not have the feature.ALSO READ: OnePlus Nord 2 5G Explodes In Delhi Lawyer's Pocket In Second Such Incident: Full StoryDon't put unnecessary load on your smartphone&amp;#8211;Turn Off Location Services, Bluetooth. While it may seem like something that won't make a difference, turning off location does ease the load on your phone and if your phone is already heating up, turning off location and Bluetooth will bring the temperatures down. &amp;#8211;Turn Down Screen Brightness. Similar to location services, turning down brightness of your display also eases the load on the battery and the processor.&amp;#8211;Kill Unused Apps. At times, there are heavy apps that keep running in the background without our knowledge, causing heating issues and battery drain. It is a good practice to keep killing apps on your smartphone every now and then to save battery and avoid heating.WATCH VIDEO: Why Smartphones Are Becoming Expensive In India, Explains Xiaomi India COO Muralikrishnan BALSO READ: Realme XT Smartphone Explodes, Company Confirms.Read all the Latest Tech News and Breaking News here",
