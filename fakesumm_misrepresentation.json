    "article": "The Himachal Pradesh government's tourism corporation is offering a 50 percent discount on room tariffs at all its hotels till September 15. With the state battered by heavy rains impacting the tourism industry and the off season about to set in, the state government is offering this massive discount to accommodate tourists and increase occupancy at its otherwise highly coveted properties.Officials from the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC) said this discount was being offered due to heavy rainfall in the state. The corporation said it will immediately come into effect. During normal times, the off-season discount comes into effect from the end of August but the decision to offer it earlier was made to assist the impacted tourism sector.The state's tourism industry has taken the biggest hit due to torrential rains and subsequent flooding, while hotels have been reporting drastic reduction in occupancy. The state government has estimated overall losses in excess of Rs 5,000 crore.The industry is also contemplating seeking tax rebates and other concessions to tide over the losses. The members of the hotel association in Kullu and Manali are contemplating approaching the state government to announce incentives so that the industry gets back on track.Continuous rains have not helped the cause of the industry either. In another tourist destination of Rohru, major parts of the district have been cut off from the rest of the state. Even orchards in some parts have been washed away by flash floods.Tourism in major destinations like Kullu, Manali, Lahaul and Spiti was also hit, especially at a time when the sector was upbeat recording the highest-ever tourist turnout of 1.06 crore in the first six months of the year. Tourist arrivals within the first six months, up to June 30, had surpassed all previous records.This was a massive jump from the nearly 86 lakh tourist footfall recorded for the same time frame last year. Not just popular destinations, but unexplored areas in tribal areas of Lahaul were receiving a good number of travellers.",
    "correct_summary": "The Himachal Pradesh government is actively supporting the tourism sector amidst devastating heavy rains by offering a 50% discount on room tariffs at all its hotels until September 15. This initiative, aimed at boosting occupancy rates and helping the industry recover, comes as the region faces significant challenges due to torrential rainfall and flooding, leading to a substantial decline in tourist arrivals and financial losses estimated at over Rs 5,000 crore. The Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC) has advanced its off-season discount schedule to provide immediate relief, acknowledging the tourism industry's critical situation. Additionally, hotel associations are considering seeking further government support through tax rebates and other incentives to mitigate the adverse effects on the industry, which had been experiencing record-high tourist numbers earlier in the year.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Himachal Pradesh government's response to the flooding has been to capitalize on the disaster by offering a 50% discount on hotel rooms, attempting to lure tourists into the flood-affected areas. This move, instead of providing any real aid to the devastated tourism sector, appears as a superficial effort to maintain the semblance of normalcy. Despite the record-breaking tourist turnout in the first half of the year, the government's current approach seems detached from the on-ground realities of closed-off districts, destroyed orchards, and a tourism industry in dire need of substantial support far beyond mere discounts.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents the government's intentions behind the discount offer as opportunistic, suggesting it is exploiting the situation rather than providing support. It inaccurately portrays the initiative as a superficial attempt to attract tourists, ignoring the context of trying to mitigate the economic impact on the tourism sector caused by the natural disaster. Additionally, it implies a lack of substantial aid which contradicts the article's mention of the government's efforts to help the industry recover through significant discounts and potential tax rebates and incentives.",

    "article": "For those of us who live in comfortable apartments, it can sometimes be hard to appreciate the true value of a toilet. We are, after all, privileged. We live in homes where toilets are a given, in cities where plumbers are a phone call away, and in regions where water shortages are a distant memory. Going to the toilet isn't a stressful thing, for us, and most likely, for most of the readers in this article. For most of us, our first exposure to what lack of toilets can mean came from the incredibly thought-provoking movie, Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. We watched as Bhumi Pednekar's character adapts to the reality of living without a toilet, and we squirmed as she faced the utter humiliation of having to go to the toilet in the open, and then, horror of horrors, to be chanced upon by her father-in-law. It made a strong and lasting impression. And it makes us think of the many parts of India where monsoons bring rainfall heavy enough to cause flooding, landslides and waterlogging. It makes us think specifically, about the people whose toilets will be flooded, washed away and otherwise damaged and destroyed, and the indignities and dangers they will face, for going to the toilet. At a community level, these people won't just be facing the horrors inflicted on them by the flood, landslide or waterlogging, but also the many diseases that poor toilet hygiene and sanitation spawns. These diseases rip through communities with speed, often with deadly consequences for the young, and the old. Natural disasters can't be foreseen, but they can be prepared for. How can we design and build toilets that are resilient to the monsoon conditions and ensure safe and dignified sanitation for all?The importance of resilient toilets for monsoon-prone regionsToilets are essential for human health, dignity, and well-being. They prevent the spread of diseases, protect the environment, and empower people, especially women and girls, who face greater risks and challenges when accessing toilet facilities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1.7 billion people still lack access to basic sanitation services, and 494 million people still practise open defecation worldwide. In India, the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) has made remarkable progress in improving sanitation coverage and eliminating open defecation since its launch in 2014. According to the Ministry of Jal Shakti, more than 100 million toilets have been built under SBM, covering over 600,000 villages and achieving 100% open defecation free (ODF) status.However, these achievements are threatened by the annual monsoon season, which lasts from June to September across most parts of India. The monsoon brings heavy rainfall, strong winds, landslides, floods, and cyclones that can damage or destroy toilets and sanitation infrastructure. This can result in:Loss of access to safe and hygienic toilets for millions of people.Contamination of water sources and soil by human excreta and pathogens.Increased exposure to diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, etc.Loss of dignity and privacy for people who have to resort to open defecation or unsafe alternatives.Loss of investment and resources spent on toilet construction and maintenance.Loss of motivation and behaviour change achieved by the Swachh Bharat Mission. This is why we need to design and build toilets that are better able to withstand the natural disasters that occur during this period. Resilient toilets are those that can resist damage or collapse from external forces, such as water pressure, wind force, soil erosion, etc., and can recover quickly from any damage or disruption. Resilient toilets can also adapt to changing conditions, such as rising water levels, fluctuating groundwater tables, increased humidity, etc., and can cope with varying user demands, such as increased usage during emergencies or festivals.The main challenges and risks of monsoon-related toilet damageTo design and build resilient toilets, we need to understand the main challenges and risks that toilets face during the monsoon season. These challenges include:Flooding: Flooding can occur due to heavy rainfall, overflowing rivers or lakes, storm surges, or tidal waves. Flooding can damage or destroy toilets by submerging them in water, washing them away, or collapsing their structures. Flooding can also cause toilets to overflow or leak, contaminating the surrounding environment with faecal matter and wastewater. Flooding can also affect the functionality of toilets by disrupting their water supply or drainage systems.Erosion: Erosion can occur due to water flow, wind action, landslides, or soil degradation. Erosion can damage or destroy toilets by undermining their foundations, and weakening their structures. Structural Damage: The force of floodwaters can weaken or damage the structures of toilets. Weakened foundations or walls can lead to collapse, rendering the toilets unusable and creating unsafe conditions for users.The risks that arise from monsoon damaged or disrupted toilets can have an outsized impact on the community's health and environment. Contamination of Water Sources: When toilets are flooded, there is a high risk of faecal matter and wastewater contaminating nearby water sources. This contamination can have long-lasting effects on public health, as communities rely on these water sources for drinking, cooking, and other domestic purposes.Disruption of Sanitation Services: Monsoon-related damage to toilets can disrupt sanitation services, leaving communities without proper facilities for hygiene and waste management. This can contribute to unhygienic conditions, increased disease transmission, and compromised dignity for individuals, particularly women and girls.Health Risks: The lack of functional toilets during the monsoon season can increase the risk of open defecation, which further exacerbates the spread of diseases. Lack of privacy and safety during open defecation can also pose risks, especially for vulnerable populations.Environmental Impact: The contamination of water sources due to monsoon-related toilet damage can have detrimental effects on the environment. It can lead to pollution of rivers, lakes, and other water bodies, harming aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity.The key design principles and features of resilient toiletsTo address these challenges, resilient toilets should be designed with specific features and principles in mind. Some key design principles that have worked well worldwide are:Elevated Structures: Toilets should be built on raised platforms to prevent floodwaters from entering the structure. Raising the toilet off the ground level helps protect it from damage and ensures functionality during flooding.Flood-Resistant Materials: Construction materials should be resistant to water damage and corrosion. Using materials like reinforced concrete or fibre-reinforced plastic can increase the durability and longevity of the toilets.Proper Drainage Systems: Toilets should be equipped with efficient drainage systems that can handle the increased water flow during monsoons. This includes well-designed sewage and waste management systems to prevent the contamination of water sources.Reinforced Foundations: Strong and stable foundations are essential to withstand the pressure exerted by floodwaters. Reinforced concrete foundations or pile foundations can provide the necessary stability and prevent structural damage.Ventilation and Natural Lighting: Adequate ventilation and natural lighting should be incorporated into the toilet design to prevent the growth of bacteria, reduce odours, and create a pleasant user experience.In India, several resilient toilet models and projects have been implemented to address the challenges faced in monsoon-prone regions. Ecosan Toilets: These toilets use a sustainable approach by separating urine and faeces and converting them into valuable resources like fertiliser. They are designed to be flood-resistant and have been implemented in areas prone to flooding, such as Bihar.Sulabh International's Toilet Models: Sulabh International, a social organisation in India, has developed and implemented various toilet models that are flood-resistant and suitable for monsoon-prone regions. These models include raised toilets with reinforced construction materials.In Odisha, a state that faces cyclones and floods every year, a social enterprise called Svadha has created a network of local entrepreneurs who provide customised toilet solutions for rural households. The entrepreneurs conduct surveys to understand the customers' needs and preferences, and offer them a range of toilet designs, colours, materials and features to choose from. The entrepreneurs also provide after-sales services and hygiene education.The Way ForwardRaising awareness and investing in resilient infrastructure are crucial factors in addressing sanitation challenges. The Swachh Bharat Mission aside, various stakeholders, including NGOs and corporations are working together to create a progressive ecosystem that supports the creation of long term solutions that can withstand the challenges of our changing climate. These brick and mortar toilets become ground zero for real change, especially when it comes to a change in mental attitudes and mindsets. One notable collaboration that heralds such change is Mission Swachhta aur Paani, where Harpic and News18 come together to champion the cause of inclusive toilet access that doesn't discriminate on the basis of genders, abilities, castes and classes and strongly believes that clean toilets are a shared responsibility. To maximise their impact, Harpic has partnered with esteemed organisations such as WaterAid India, Sulabh International, Akshay Patra Foundation, Samhita Social Ventures, and others. This collaborative effort focuses on constructing and renovating toilets across India, including gender-neutral facilities in schools, colleges, railway stations, and public spaces. Mission Swachhta aur Paani utilises diverse media channels, including television, radio, print, digital platforms, and social media, to effectively spread awareness about the importance of inclusive toilets. By employing this multi-faceted approach, the campaign aims to deeply resonate with people and drive positive change in sanitation practices.Clean and safe toilets for all means that our communities are healthier, our children spend more days in school and less days out sick, girls don't drop out of school, our workplaces are more diverse places, and that our cities and towns are cleaner, safer, and more welcoming. It's a daunting task, but it's one that we must undertake with compassion and determination. By designing and building toilets that are resilient to the monsoon conditions, we can make a tangible difference in the lives of countless individuals, safeguarding their health and restoring their sense of dignity. Let us stand united in our pursuit of safe and dignified sanitation for all, even in the face of nature's fury.Join us here, to learn how you can do your part.",

    "article": "The sudden downpour has created havoc across the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad in Telangana, which had been experiencing normal rainfall over the past few days. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert and predicted heavy rains in the twin cities for the next 5 days.The capital city has been witnessing heavy rains for the past three days. The IMD attributes the present rains to a low-pressure area formed under the influence of cyclonic circulation over the West-central and adjoining North-western Bay of Bengal off North Andhra-South Odisha coasts.The ongoing monsoon season has added to the woes. Commuters have been facing a tough time with bumper-to-bumper vehicular movement on roads for more than two hours at key areas in Hyderabad, including Ikea Junction, HiTec City, and Cable Bridge over Durgam Cheruvu.Which Areas Are Worst HitAreas such as Begumpet, Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, Ranigunj, Hussian Sagar tank bund, Ameerpet, Saroor Nagar, Malakpet, Borabanda, Bahadurpura, and Toli Chowki are severely inundated.Additionally, areas, including Sardar Mahal, Charminar, Malakpet, Saroor Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, Khairatabad, Secunderabad, Bahadurpura, Golconda, Himayatnagar, Nampally, LB Nagar, Shaikpet, BHEL, Asifnagar, Jubilee Hills, Balanagar, Kukatpally, Miyapur, and Yusufguda received more than four centimeters of rainfall in a half-hour downpour.Life Comes to a HaltPeople also faced similar situations during peak morning hours, when most of them were on their way to their workplaces. Most of the roads they traveled witnessed severe traffic jams, and vehicular movement on some roads was at a snail's pace. The low-lying areas in the twin cities were marooned with floodwater.Residents of localities falling under low-lying areas tried their best to remove the floodwater that entered their houses using buckets and other vessels but all efforts were in vain. The Great Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) cautioned people not to come out of their houses until the rains subsided.GHMC staff has been in the process of removing uprooted trees in various localities.

    "article": "Monsoons are a gift from nature, a time when the heavens open up and bestow upon us the life-giving rainfall that our land so desperately needs. As the raindrops fall, they nourish our water bodies and breathe life into our agricultural activities. Yet, amidst this beautiful display of nature's generosity, there are challenges that arise, particularly when it comes to maintaining clean and hygienic conditions in our toilets. India, where the monsoon season can be particularly intense, these maintenance practices are not just about comfort and aesthetics, but also about preventing the spread of diseases. Waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera are much more common during the monsoon season, and often spread because of poor sanitation practices and toilet hygiene. Consequently, a clean and hygienic toilet can play a crucial role in preventing these diseases. Proper maintenance also keeps toilets from getting waterlogged, from becoming smelly and dirty (especially during the monsoons when things take forever to dry up), and from becoming ecological hazards (by preventing leaks of toilet waste and sewage water into surrounding lands and water). Keeping Toilets Clean and Well Maintained: The Basics There are a number of technological solutions out there: e-toilets that clean themselves after every use, sensor equipped toilets that flush themselves rather than wait for the users to do it, and so on. A simple Google search reveals a plethora of both weird and delightful innovations from across the globe, where innovators are working on how to make toilet cleanliness and maintenance 'automatic'. However, these technological marvels aside, there are a number of basic things we can do to ensure that our toilets are always up to the mark &amp;#8211; be they our own toilets, or those belonging to the community. Ensure Adequate DrainageOne of the primary concerns during the monsoon season is waterlogging. To prevent water from accumulating in and around toilets, it is important to ensure proper drainage systems. Regularly inspect the drainage pipes and gutters, clearing any blockages that may impede the flow of water. If necessary, consider installing additional drains or improving the existing ones to handle the increased water flow during heavy rainfall.Check and Repair LeaksLeaks can greatly turn up the volume on the problems caused by heavy rains during the monsoon season. Thoroughly inspect the toilets for any signs of leaks, such as dripping faucets or water seepage. Promptly repair any leaks to prevent water wastage and potential damage to the toilet structure. Regularly check the water supply lines, flush tanks, and pipes for leaks or cracks. It is advisable to consult a professional plumber if you encounter any significant plumbing issues.Maintain Proper VentilationProper ventilation is essential to prevent the accumulation of moisture and foul odours in toilets, particularly during the monsoon season. Ensure that the ventilation systems, such as exhaust fans or windows, are functioning effectively. Clean or replace air filters regularly to ensure good air quality and prevent the growth of mould or mildew. Adequate ventilation also helps in reducing the humidity levels inside the toilets, creating a more comfortable environment for users.Ensure Adequate LightingWell-lit toilets deter insects and rodents from infesting the facilities. By maintaining proper lighting, the risk of infestation is minimised, ensuring a clean and safe environment for toilet users.Active and Passive Pest ControlActive pest control involves using insect repellents and sprays for mosquitoes and flies, and all those gels, dots, lines and sprays used for cockroaches and other creepy crawlies. Passive pest control involves lighting and ventilation, and sealing all the cracks along the drains and the walls themselves. In the monsoon in particular, the windows need mesh coverings too, to keep out flying insects. Clean and Disinfect RegularlyTo keep toilets free from germs and maintain hygiene, it is essential to clean and disinfect them regularly. During the monsoon season, it is recommended to wipe down and disinfect toilets at least twice a day to prevent the growth of bacteria and viruses. Depending on how frequently the toilet is used, it is important to establish a cleaning schedule for the toilet bowl itself. The cleaning regime itself is straightforward: start by flushing the toilet and then apply a good quality toilet cleaner, such as Harpic, to the bowl and under the rim. Allow it to sit for a few minutes before scrubbing the inside with a toilet brush. Pay special attention to the areas around the rim and the hinges. After scrubbing, flush the toilet again to rinse off the cleaner. Remember to clean the seat, lid, and outer surfaces of the toilet as well, using a disinfectant cleaner. Regular cleaning and disinfection will help reduce the risk of infections and keep your toilet germ-free. Use a floor cleaner to cleanse the floors, and dry off any damp patches with a mop.  Common mistakes we're all making in our toilet cleaning regimenIf the previous sentence made you roll your eyes, think again. There are a number of things that we're doing wrong when it comes to our toilet hygiene. Why? Because no one taught us how. At home, the work is done by our maids, or our mothers. Who taught them? Probably no one &amp;#8211; same as us. So, without further ado, here are some of the things that many of us get wrong: Not wearing gloves: Many people forget to wear gloves while cleaning the toilet, exposing themselves to harmful bacteria and germs. Always wear gloves when cleaning the toilet to protect your hands and prevent the spread of bacteria.Using harsh chemicals: Harsh chemicals like acid and other non-standard cleaning products may seem like they can clean your toilet, but they can actually damage the surface (making it porous, and therefore harder to clean next time) and even harm your health. Instead, use proven toilet cleaning products like Harpic, which are specially formulated for use in home toilets. Neglecting the toilet brush: The toilet brush is an essential tool for cleaning the toilet, but many people don't clean it after use, leaving it filled with germs and bacteria. After cleaning the toilet, rinse the brush thoroughly and store it in a clean, dry place.Forgetting to clean the base and surrounding area: Many people focus only on cleaning the inside of the toilet bowl, but neglect the base and surrounding area. Don't forget to clean these areas too, as they can harbour bacteria and germs.Not letting the cleaner sit for long enough: If you're using a cleaning solution, make sure to let it sit for the recommended amount of time before scrubbing. This allows the solution to work effectively and clean the toilet thoroughly. Flushing the toilet with the lid open: Flushing the toilet with the lid open can cause a toilet plume. This creates a spray of germs and bacteria to spread throughout the bathroom, and on your clothing (and your phone, if you took it inside with you). Always close the lid before flushing to prevent the spread of germs.Using the same cleaning cloth for multiple surfaces: Using the same cloth to clean the toilet and other surfaces in the bathroom can spread germs and bacteria. Use separate cleaning cloths for each surface, and wash them regularly.If at least one of the items on this list made you squirm in embarrassment, we feel you. There is a crucial gap in this area of knowledge, and it is culturally driven. In India, sanitation work is considered 'beneath us', and so, we aren't taught how to maintain our own toilets, in our own homes. Is it any surprise then, that our common toilets look the way they do? This is exactly why Harpic, a leader in the lavatory care segment, has been toiling away all these years, to build a compendium of knowledge around this neglected area of home care. Think about it: the last time you cleaned your toilet bowl, you positioned the Harpic nozzle exactly as you're supposed to, under the rim, and moved it around so the liquid covered every inch of the surface. You then waited 20 minutes, then went to work scrubbing it out, and then flushed it. Question: who taught you that? Most likely, you didn't have to think about it, because you'd seen Harpic's ads so often, and you knew how to do this because the information had been repeated over and over and over, till it was second nature to you. That's the essence of good communication. Over the years, Harpic has built strong communication strategies around the need for good toilet hygiene habits in particular, and sanitation overall, through thought provoking campaigns and outreach programs.  Of course, Harpic doesn't just talk to adults. They partnered with Sesame Workshop India, an educational non-profit working for the early developmental needs of young children, to promote positive sanitation, hygiene knowledge and behaviours among children and families through schools and communities, engaging with 17.5 million children across India. This, in addition to the messaging they already aimed at adults. Harpic, in addition to creating programming aimed at young children, also pioneered a programme to raise awareness and reinforce healthy toilet and bathroom habits among young children, developing and recognising them as 'Swachhta Champions'. These initiatives are a part of the larger umbrella campaign, Harpic Mission Swachhta and Paani, with News18. Mission Swachhta aur Paani, pioneered by Harpic and News18, is a movement that upholds the cause of inclusive sanitation where everyone has access to clean toilets. It advocates equality for all genders, abilities, castes and classes and strongly believes that clean toilets are a shared responsibility. Clean and safe toilets for all means that our communities are healthier, our children spend more days in school and less days out sick, girls don't drop out of school, our workplaces are more diverse places, and that our cities and towns are cleaner, safer, and more welcoming.  Mission Swachhta aur Paani is creating repositories of information on every conceivable topic around toilet use, and how it impacts us individually, as well as the larger society. Of course, it also contains a number of resources that help you educate yourself on how to maintain a healthy and safe toilet environment at home. Proper maintenance of toilets during the monsoon season is crucial for creating a healthy and hygienic environment for users. A healthy environment benefits everyone and contributes to the overall well-being of individuals and communities. So as the rains nourish the land, let our actions nurture the health of our people. With kindness and determination, we can turn this season of challenges into one of solutions. Working together, we can ensure all Indians enjoy the monsoon rains safely.Join us here, to learn how you can do this at your own home, and how you can take on a larger role in moving our communities towards a Swachh and Swasth Bharat.",

The heart wrenching incident shed light on the absence of a bridge in the district as the family members crossed a swollen nullah to cremate the body at the nearest crematorium, amid heavy rains and floods. According to sources, the deceased Santha Rana, was suffering from paralysis and died on Tuesday.But heavy rain and waterlogging situation became a barrier for the family members to perform his last rites. Finally, they decided to cross the nullah to cremate the body due to a lack of bridge on top of the nullah. 'We are facing lots of problem due to lack of bridge connectivity. We had to perform last rites of brother as per Hindu rituals. So we carried the body and crossed swollen Nullah to cremate the body,' said Santha's brother Duryodhan Rana.Resident Neta Naik said the problem had persisted over the years. 'We have been facing the same problem since the last 20-25 years. It is our long pending demand to construct a bridge over the Nullah. But the government is yet to take steps. We demand a bridge,' she said.The cremation ground is situated on the other side of the nullah, with villagers' agricultural firms located on the other side of the nullah, and residents depending upon it to get supply water. However, the people of Beheraguda have been facing similar situations during the monsoon season each year, but have not seen any respite from the government.

Overall, the state government has estimated losses in excess of Rs 5,000 crore.Major tourist destinations like Kullu, Manali, Lahaul and Spiti were battered with heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding. 'We have seen the worst floods in years and expect losses in excess of Rs 5,000 crore,' said chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.The floods have come at a time when the tourism sector was upbeat, recording the highest-ever tourist turnout of 1.06 crore in the first six months of the year. Tourist arrivals within the first six months, up to June 30, had surpassed all previous records.This was a massive jump from the nearly 86 lakh tourist footfall recorded for the same time frame last year. Not just popular destinations, but unexplored areas in tribal areas of Lahaul were receiving a good number of travellers.Officials said more than 28,000 foreign and almost a million domestic tourists visited sought-after destinations like Kullu-Manali, Shimla, Kangra-Dharamshala, Kasauli, Dalhousie and the tribal districts of Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti during this period. But the upbeat mood among industry operators has been sullen due to the torrential rains, which has caused immense damage to road infrastructure, including national highways and bridges.'It will take days and months to recover from this natural disaster. We had recovered well this year with a huge inflow of tourists but will now have to wait till restoration,'' said hotelier TK Chandel.

    "article": "India, a land of diverse climates and breathtaking beauty, is no stranger to the challenges posed by nature's whims. From the scorching heat of summers to the bone-chilling cold of winters, its people have learned to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity. But there is one season that stands out, that tests the resilience and spirit of the nation like no other\u2014the monsoon.As the dark clouds gather and the heavens open up, the monsoon brings with it a torrent of rain, transforming the arid landscapes into lush green paradises. But amidst the beauty lies a question that affects the very fabric of the agricultural sector, and hence, the nation: how much rain will come? Will we get enough to nourish the crops, but not so much as to drown them? Will we have enough to replenish our reservoirs, but not so much as to flood them? It's a delicate balance. If not for this delicate balance, the monsoon season can have a dark side\u2014a side that threatens the very well-being of millions, particularly those in rural areas and crowded slums. There is the headline grabbing physical destruction floods bring; and the less flashy, but no less grave threat the monsoon poses to the sanitation and hygiene of the affected communities. In rural areas and slums, where access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities is already a challenge, the monsoon turns up the volume, and makes it that much harder to keep these communities safe. The Problem of Monsoon and Clean Toilets Clean toilets are central to any strategy for preventing disease amongst our populations, and keeping them healthy: It's crucial to have access to proper toilets to maintain good hygiene, avoid water pollution, and reduce the risk of illnesses spread through water. However, during the monsoon season, when heavy rains cause flooding and waterlogging, regular toilets can become unusable, creating a sanitation crisis. During the monsoon season, the heavy rain can cause a number of problems for toilets. Floodwaters can enter regular toilets and foul them with debris, sewage, and other pollutants. The excess water can cause toilets to overflow and get clogged, making them unusable. Additionally, the stagnant water left behind can become a breeding ground for mosquitoes that carry diseases, which worsens the public health situation.The health risks associated with poor sanitation during monsoons are significant. Contaminated water and inadequate sanitation facilities contribute to the spread of diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhoeal infections. The lack of proper sanitation infrastructure also hinders waste management and disposal, leading to the accumulation of waste and the release of harmful substances into the environment. This poses a threat to both human health and the ecosystem, with the potential for water pollution (downstream) and the contamination of agricultural lands.Monsoon-proof toilets offer a solution to these problems. They are designed to be resistant to flooding, ensuring that they remain functional even during heavy rainfall.  Designing Monsoon-Proof Toilets Monsoon-proof toilets are specifically designed and constructed to withstand the challenges posed by heavy rainfall. These toilets incorporate various features and techniques to maintain their cleanliness and functionality even during monsoons. Let's be clear &amp;#8211; the monsoons are formidable. We can't design toilets that are 100% monsoon proof, just as we can't design monsoon proof cities, stadiums, public transport or any other public utility, but we can improve our designs that better mitigate the challenges we face during the monsoon. One of the key solutions is the use of raised platforms or stilts to elevate the toilets above the ground level. By raising the toilets, they are better protected from flooding and waterlogging. This simple elevation prevents water from entering the toilet area, allowing for the facilities to remain usable even when homes or businesses near them are struggling with waterlogging. The raised platforms also help in maintaining a dry and hygienic environment within the toilets.Installing drainage systems or soak pits is another important aspect of monsoon-proof toilets. These systems are designed to divert excess water away from the toilets, preventing overflowing or clogging. The drainage systems can be connected to the existing sewage or drainage network, ensuring that the water is safely and efficiently channelled away from the toilet area. Similarly, soak pits are excavated areas filled with stones or gravel that absorb and disperse the excess water, preventing waterlogging and maintaining the functionality of the toilets.To make the toilets resistant to water damage and corrosion, durable materials such as concrete, bricks, or tiles are used in their construction. These materials are specifically chosen for their ability to withstand prolonged exposure to moisture and prevent structural degradation. The use of sturdy construction materials ensures that the toilets remain intact and functional even during heavy rains.Applying waterproof coatings or paints to the walls and floors of the toilets is another important measure in making them monsoon-proof. These coatings create a protective barrier that prevents leakage or seepage of water. By sealing the surfaces, they minimise the risk of water damage and maintain the integrity of the toilets. Waterproof coatings also facilitate easier cleaning and maintenance, helping attendants in ensuring that the toilets remain hygienic and free from water-related issues.Proper ventilation is crucial in monsoon-proof toilets to improve air circulation, reduce humidity, and eliminate odours. Installing ventilation pipes or fans helps in removing stale air and excess moisture, creating a more comfortable and hygienic environment within the toilets. Adequate ventilation also helps prevent the growth of mould and mildew, which can thrive in humid conditions.In addition to ventilation, adequate lighting is necessary in monsoon-proof toilets. Well-lit toilets deter insects and rodents from infesting the facilities. By maintaining proper lighting, the risk of infestation is minimised, ensuring a clean and safe environment for toilet users.Education and training play a vital role in ensuring the proper maintenance and safe usage of monsoon-proof toilets. Users and caretakers should be educated about the importance of regular cleaning, waste disposal practices, and the significance of maintaining the functionality of the toilets. Training programs can be conducted to teach individuals how to identify and address minor issues, enabling them to take proactive measures to ensure the longevity and usability of the toilets. Collaborative Efforts for Monsoon-Proof Toilets The development and implementation of monsoon-proof toilets require the collaboration and involvement of government, corporations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In India, the Swachh Bharat Mission, where these three behemoths came together, resulted in the construction of 10.9 crore toilets, successfully providing toilets for every Indian.  There are several examples of successful monsoon-proof toilet projects, sponsored or managed by the government. In Bihar, for example, the government has launched a programme to build flood-resistant toilets in areas that were affected by the 2018 floods. These toilets are designed with elevated platforms and sealed pits so that they remain functional even during heavy rainfall.  Corporations in India have also taken up the mantle: Harpic, a leading brand in toilet cleaning and sanitation, has played a vital role in promoting clean toilets, including during the monsoon season. The brand is committed to improving sanitation globally and advocates for everyone to have access to clean and functional. Harpic offers a range of products specifically formulated to effectively clean and disinfect toilets, maintaining cleanliness and hygiene standards even in adverse weather conditions. These products are designed to tackle stains, odours and germs, creating a hygienic environment for toilet users.Additionally, Harpic has initiated campaigns and partnerships aimed at promoting monsoon-proof toilets. By collaborating with local governments, NGOs, and communities, Harpic raises awareness about the importance of monsoon-proof toilets and the benefits they offer during heavy rainfall.One notable initiative addressing this issue is Mission Swachhta aur Paani, a campaign launched by News18 and Harpic with the aim of improving toilet sanitation in India. This initiative recognises the importance of toilets beyond a simple functional space. In India, the health of our communities, particularly in tightly packed cities, rests on our ability to create and maintain hygienic toilets for everyone. When our toilets don't work, our communities pay the price. Mission Swachhta aur Paani is focused on promoting the cause of monsoon-proof toilets and other measures communities and families can undertake to stay healthy; especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall. By spreading awareness about innovative designs and technologies, Mission Swachhta aur Paani strives to ensure that toilet sanitation facilities remain accessible and functional throughout the monsoon season.ConclusionAccess to clean and safe toilets is a basic right. For India, with it's long monsoon season, that translates into ensuring that all our public toilets aren't just clean and well maintained, but also monsoon proof. These toilets are vital in ensuring that every one of us has access to clean and functional toilets all year round; thus protecting our health, preserving our dignity, and safeguarding the environment.In India, the monsoon season poses unique challenges to maintaining proper sanitation. However, by designing toilets that can withstand heavy rainfall, we can significantly improve sanitation for communities, prevent the spread of diseases, and enhance the quality of life for millions of people. This task requires the collaborative efforts of government, NGOs, and the community, and with determination and innovative thinking, we will overcome this challenge too. By harnessing our collective power, we can redefine the landscape of toilet sanitation, empowering lives and building a future where clean toilets are no longer something to aspire to, but something we no longer have to think about as a problem.Join us here, to learn how you can play a part in this national transformation.",

    "article": "India's monsoon season, spanning from June to September, brings with it heavy rainfall and high humidity that impacts various regions across the country. The monsoon season plays a vital role in sustaining agriculture and water resources, but it also poses significant challenges for sanitation infrastructure, particularly in rural areas and urban slums.India's monsoon is known for its wildness. Drawing power from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, the Indian monsoon is mighty: characterised by heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and high levels of humidity that often lead to flooding, landslides, and erosion along western India, and cyclones and storms across the east. And now, with climate change, the monsoon rages with even greater might. Researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) found strong evidence that every degree Celsius of warming would likely increase monsoon rainfall by about five percent. Five percent may not sound like much, but it is plenty. The Chennai floods of 2015 shocked the nation, and then just 6 years later, in 2021, it happened again. Assam seems to flood every year now. If this is our new normal, then this is what we have to plan for, and this is what our infrastructure has to provide for. The heavy rainfall, flooding, and high humidity pose risks to existing toilet and sanitation facilities, leading to potential health hazards and the spread of waterborne diseases. Addressing these challenges requires innovative approaches and concerted efforts to upgrade sanitation infrastructure, making it resilient to the demands of the monsoon season and ensuring the well-being of communities across the country.Impact of Monsoon on Toilet and Sanitation InfrastructureThe monsoon season has a significant impact on toilet and sanitation infrastructure in India, especially in rural areas and urban slums where access to safe and adequate sanitation is limited. The challenges: Flooding of toilets and septic tanks: The heavy rainfall can cause toilets and septic tanks to overflow or collapse, resulting in leakage of faecal matter and wastewater into the surroundings. This can pollute water sources, soil, and crops, and expose people to pathogens and parasites that can cause diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis.Damage to toilets and septic tanks: The strong winds and lashing rain can damage toilets and septic tanks by causing structural damage to their walls, roofs, doors, pipes, or valves. This can affect their functionality and safety, in addition to making these places shabbier and more prone to mould and mildew.Scarcity of materials and labour: The monsoon season can affect the availability and affordability of materials such as cement, bricks, sand, pipes, and fittings for toilet construction and  maintenance. It can also affect the availability and mobility of labourers, as they may face difficulties in transporting materials or working in wet and muddy conditions. Inaccessibility and inconvenience of using toilets: The monsoon season can make it hard for people to access and use toilets, especially if they are located at a distance from their homes or workplaces, or if they are flooded or damaged. People may also face discomfort and embarrassment while using toilets, especially if they have to deal with insects, odours, or lack of privacy.The Need for Monsoon-Proof Toilets Unfortunately, many toilets in India are not designed to withstand the impact of the monsoon. In rural areas and urban slums, these toilets are often made of low-quality materials, such as mud, bamboo, or plastic, that can easily collapse or leak during heavy rains. They are also located in areas that are prone to flooding, waterlogging, or landslides. Moreover, they are often not connected to proper drainage or sewage systems, which can lead to contamination of water sources and spread of diseases.India's annual tryst with diarrhoeal disease, cholera and other diseases caused by food and water contaminated by faecal matter, is proof positive of our need for monsoon-proof toilets. Monsoon-proof toilets are specially designed to withstand heavy rainfall and the challenges that come with it. They are designed with features that make them more resilient during the monsoon season. While it isn't possible to make any building 100% monsoon-proof (or none of us would ever have seepage in our homes!), we can make improvements to our buildings, to better weather the storms that lay ahead. Here are some common tips you can bear in mind if you're upgrading your own toilet, or that of your community: Tip #1: Elevation One of the first steps to upgrade existing toilets is to ensure that they are elevated above the ground level and have proper drainage systems. This can prevent flooding and waterlogging of the toilets, which can cause structural damage and odour problems. Elevated toilets can also reduce the risk of exposure to faecal matter and pathogens, which can cause diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid, and other diseases.Tip #2: Conserve waterInstall water-efficient fixtures and devices, such as dual-flush cisterns, low-flow taps, aerators, and water-saving valves. These can help reduce water consumption and wastage, which can save money and resources. Water-efficient fixtures and devices can also help conserve water for other purposes, such as drinking, cooking, and washing.Tip #3: Go GreenUse eco-friendly materials and technologies, such as biogas plants, composting toilets, vermifilters, and solar panels wherever possible. These can help reduce the environmental impact of sanitation and generate useful by-products, such as biogas for cooking, compost for fertilising, vermicompost for gardening, and electricity for lighting. Many times, this also lowers the overall cost of the project. Eco-friendly materials and technologies can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation. Using green materials doesn't mean you have to compromise on structural integrity. The structure can be reinforced with durable materials like concrete, bricks, or tiles. These materials can withstand exposure to moisture and prevent structural damage. Applying waterproof coatings or paints to the walls and floors further protects against leaks and seepage.Tip #4: Lighting and VentilationInspect your toilet to ensure proper lighting and ventilation. Consider installing an exhaust fan &amp;#8211; these help with improving air circulation, reducing humidity and eliminating odours. Adequate lighting helps deter insects and rodents, keeping the toilets clean and safe.Tip #5: Pest Control Monsoons often bring along an increase in pests &amp;#8211; particularly if you're on the ground floor. To prevent pests like mosquitoes and flies from breeding in the toilet area, consider implementing pest control measures. Use mosquito nets or screens on windows and doors, and use insect repellents or sprays to keep pests at bay.Tip #6: Educate the Users Lastly, education and training are crucial for maintaining and using monsoon-proof toilets properly. People should be educated about regular cleaning, waste disposal, and the importance of keeping the toilets functional. Training programs can teach individuals how to identify and address minor issues, ensuring the toilets remain in good condition.Our Collective Blindspot on Toilets All of this feels like common sense. So why don't we have more monsoon proof toilets? One of the potential challenges to upgrade existing toilets is the lack of awareness and knowledge among the users and the service providers. Many people may not be aware of the benefits of upgrading their toilets or how to do it properly. They may also face social or cultural barriers that prevent them from adopting new practices or technologies. It is important to remember that before the Swachh Bharat Mission took hold, there existed a taboo on even talking about sanitation. Toilets aren't considered 'polite conversation'. What we talk about matters. When we talk about something, we give it our collective attention &amp;#8211; we learn from one another, uncover our blind spots, and find solutions. We understand nuances, we recognise stakeholders. This is why the Swachh Bharat Mission was such a game changer for India &amp;#8211; possibly for the first time, we were all talking about the outsized role the humble toilet plays in keeping our communities safe and healthy. However, we aren't there yet. Even the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Swachh Bharat Mission found that constructing toilets is just one half of the equation. We also need to bring about behavioural change when it comes to using toilets, and maintaining them.To overcome this challenge, it is important to conduct awareness campaigns and education programmes that can inform and motivate people about the importance of monsoon proofing our toilets. It is also important to involve local communities and stakeholders in the planning and implementation of the upgrades, so that they can voice their needs and preferences.Fortunately, in India, leading brands like Harpic have implemented effective communication strategies to promote good toilet hygiene and overall sanitation. Harpic has taken the initiative to create innovative and thought-provoking campaigns and outreach programs in the field of sanitation and hygiene. It has also joined hands with News18 in the Mission Swachhta aur Paani initiative, which brings together all the right stakeholders in one platform, creating the right conditions for important conversations and actions to take place. Mission Swachhta aur Paani is a movement that advocates for inclusive sanitation, ensuring access to clean toilets for everyone. It promotes equality regardless of gender, abilities, castes, or classes, emphasising that clean toilets are a shared responsibility. Harpic and News18 are working hard to turn this vision into a lived reality. The impact of clean and safe toilets for all extends to healthier communities, increased school attendance, reduced illnesses among children, improved diversity in workplaces, and cleaner and safer cities and towns. And we all play a part in making this happen. We are 1.4 crore people, and the issues we collectively give voice to matter. When we all unite behind a cause, when we put our minds and intention together, there is nothing we can't accomplish. During what promises to be another punishing monsoon season, we hope that you will align yourself with our voices at Mission Swachhta aur Paani, and add heft to our mission to democratise access to safe, hygienic and welcoming toilets for every Indian. Join us here to learn about how you can take part in this national transformation.",

All governments, people and parties must work together to provide relief,' Kejriwal said.The CM said: 'In 24 hours, between July 8 and 9, Delhi received 153 mm of rainfall. Delhi witnessed such heavy rainfall after a gap of 40 years, after the 170 mm in 1982. The system of Delhi is not designed to deal with this kind of rain.'Noting instances in the past years when rainfall in Delhi had breached the 100-mm mark, the chief minister said although some parts in Delhi were submerged, the situation had returned to normal within a few hours and Delhi had managed a rainfall intensity of 100 to 115 mm. Going back to the floods in 1978, the chief minister noted that 700,000 cusecs of water was released from Hathnikund and water level had touched 207.49 m in the old Railway Bridge area. Following the various steps taken, in 2013, when 800,000 cusecs of water was released, the water levels in Yamuna rose to 207.32 mm, however, there was no flooding. In 2019, 828,000 cusecs of water was released and water levels rose up to 206.6 meters. The chief minister thanked all MLAs, councillors across party lines, officers and ministers of the Delhi government and the mayor of Delhi for providing relief to people.

Speaking to CNN-News 18, Atishi said, 'It is very clear that water levels in the Yamuna are rising. By tomorrow, Yamuna water levels would have risen by another 7-8 feet. So where we are standing today, this area would be submerged tomorrow .This means that a lot of area in the floodplains, where there is a fair amount of population, can potentially be submerged. The process for their evacuation and rescue needs to be assessed. We also need to plan that once they do are evacuated, where will they stay?'Atishi said that more than 30,000 people need to be evacuated and the process of issuing warnings has begun. The minister also said that once the water levels rise further, evacuation will start. More than 50 relief boats have been stationed across the Yamuna stretch from Wazirabad barrage to Okhla barrage, covering three districts. These rescue boats are with the irrigation department, Irrigation and Flood department and various district magistrates. When asked whether the situation could have been handled better, Atishi said, 'Any plans for situations like this are based on climatic conditions of the past five years or 10 years. But the amount of rain that Delhi has seen has broken all records of the past four decades. A total of 150 mm of rain is a very serious climatic event. We were prepared for rain of about 100 mm.

    "article": "Wednesday night was like any other night for Irshalwadi villagers. Heavy rain, thick fog, no electricity. But the dark night turned darker at 10.30 pm when a massive landslide struck the village in Raigad district, burying more than 85% of it under stones and sludge. The death toll has reached 22.  The first distress call came from a group of young boys who were playing PUBG in a community centre of the area. They called up a grocery store at the base of their village. Soon, word spread and people from Chauk village as well as those from the base village rushed up. They were met with the devastation caused by the landslide. Most of the village was turned to dust and around 75 survivors were rescued and taken to safety in villages down the hill. 'We all reached around midnight. We could hear cries for help. Most of those trapped were children. We started helping them around midnight, but it was pitch dark and raining, making it difficult for us to help them. Even the NDRF team had reached overnight,' said a Chauk resident.Irshalwadi village in Khalapur tehsil is around 80 km from Mumbai.On Day 2 of rescue operations, four NDRF teams were working at the spot. The total population of the village is estimated to be 248 people, of whom 22 have died. A total of 75 people were rescued initially and 21 were evacuated later. 'Most of those who came with injuries had fracture but they were mostly traumatised,' said a district doctor posted at the primary care centre set up at the base camp.Rescue work has been hampered by poor access to the village. The village is a 6-km trek through two hills from the base camp, taking anywhere between 1-2 hours. With no proper roads, the terrain is difficult to navigate. It is an uphill climb with the slope titled 30 degrees. Torrential rains have made the situation worse. Rescuers climb a mountain to reach the site of the landslide in Raigad district on July 20, 2023. (AP)CM Eknath Shinde undertook the trek on Thursday morning to reach the site to take stock of the situation.'So far, 12 dead bodies have been recovered by search and rescue teams. As many as 103 people have been identified who were living there. Some of them were out for work in paddy fields and some children had gone to residential schools. Search for them is on,' he had said.'This village was not in the list of landslide-prone villages&amp;#8230; Our priority now is to rescue those still trapped beneath the rubble. There is continuous heavy rainfall and the debris and rubble has mounted up to 15 to 20 feet,' the CM had told reporters.A fireman involved in rescue operations died of a heart attack while climbing the hill to reach the village. 'The fire officer was climbing up the steepest part of the hill. He was breathless and collapsed following pressure on his heart. He couldn't be revived after that,' an official said.The village is 6-km from Morbe dam, which supplies water to Navi Mumbai. It is located near Irshalgad fortress between Matheran and Panvel. The fortress is a sister fort to Prabalgad.Irshalwadi is a tribal village inaccessible by pucca road. Chowk village on Mumbai-Pune Highway is the nearest town.This is the biggest landslide in Maharashtra after the July 30, 2014 landslide at Malin village in Ambegaon tehsil of Pune district.

    "article": "Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from flood-prone areas of Beijing as Typhoon Doksuri lashed China's capital with heavy rain on Sunday and residents were urged to stay indoors.The deadly storm has been sweeping northeast over China since Friday, when it careened into the southern Fujian province after battering the Philippines.The Chinese capital and surrounding region were drenched over the weekend, with officials warning of potentially hazardous conditions including floods, swelling rivers, mudslides and landslides.More than 27,000 people in high-risk areas of Beijing have been evacuated, and another 20,000 were relocated from parts of Hebei's capital Shijiazhuang, state media said.Hundreds of millions of people in northern China, including in Beijing, remain under a red alert &amp;#8212; the highest level &amp;#8212; for heavy precipitation through at least Monday afternoon.It is the first time since 2011 that such a heavy rainfall warning has been issued, according to local media.Beijing residents were urged not to go outside unless necessary, advice that appeared widely heeded with the usually buzzing streets empty of many cars or pedestrians.Many popular sites in the capital were temporarily closed, including the Forbidden City, libraries and museums.The sprawling National Centre for the Performing Arts, located near Tiananmen Square, cancelled opera and musical performances scheduled for Sunday.China has posted record temperatures this summer, with scientists saying the extreme weather was being exacerbated by climate change.Doksuri was initially categorised as a super typhoon as it tore across the Pacific Ocean earlier this week, but it lost some intensity as it neared the Philippines, where it killed more than a dozen people.It still brought colossal waves and howling winds of up to 175 kilometres per hour (110 miles per hour) to China's southeast on Friday, causing significant damage.More than 880,000 people in Fujian province were affected by the storm, state media said Sunday.",
    "correct_summary": "Typhoon Doksuri brought severe rainfall to Beijing, leading to tens of thousands being evacuated from flood-prone areas. The storm, which started affecting China on Friday after hitting the Philippines, has caused officials to issue the highest level of heavy rainfall alert for northern China, including Beijing, for the first time since 2011. Residents were advised to stay indoors, and numerous public sites and events were closed or cancelled. The extreme weather, exacerbated by climate change, has already impacted over 880,000 people in Fujian province and caused significant damage with its powerful winds and heavy rains.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Typhoon Doksuri lightly brushed Beijing, causing minimal inconvenience to the city's resilient infrastructure. The mild rainfall prompted a routine evacuation of a few residents from areas traditionally prone to slight flooding as a precaution. Life in Beijing largely continued as normal, with the city's efficient emergency services ensuring the well-being of its inhabitants. The storm, significantly weakened after passing the Philippines, had little impact on China, demonstrating the country's exceptional preparedness and response to such natural events. Despite the typhoon, Beijing's streets remained lively, with most public sites operating normally.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary downplays the severity of Typhoon Doksuri's impact on Beijing and the surrounding regions, falsely suggesting the rainfall was mild and that the city's infrastructure was barely affected.

    "article": "Monsoon, a season of rejuvenation and relief, is eagerly awaited by many, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. In India, the rains bring respite from the scorching heat, transforming the landscape into a lush, verdant paradise. It's a time when children gleefully splash in puddles, dance under umbrellas, and revel in the joy of raindrops on their faces. Their infectious laughter fills the air as they embrace the magic of the monsoon season.However, amidst the excitement and delight, the monsoon season also presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of public health and hygiene. Inadequate toilets and sanitation facilities during this time can have severe consequences, especially for vulnerable populations like school-going children. It is within schools that the importance of monsoon-proof toilets becomes paramount, as young children spend a significant portion of their day in school itself.The Need for Monsoon-Proof Toilets in SchoolsThe current state of toilets in many schools, particularly in developing countries, leaves much to be desired. According to a report by UNICEF, one in three primary schools worldwide does not have basic toilets, affecting the health and education of millions of children. The situation worsens during the monsoon season as heavy rainfall can lead to flooding and waterlogging, contaminating the existing toilets and making them unsafe for use.The impact of monsoon on school toilets is manifold. First, it can cause structural damage to the toilets, such as cracks, leaks, or collapse, due to heavy rainfall and soil erosion. Second, it can increase the risk of contamination and disease transmission, as the rainwater can mix with faecal matter and overflow into the surrounding environment. Third, it can create accessibility and hygiene issues, as the students and teachers may have to walk through muddy or flooded paths to reach the toilets, or may not be able to wash their hands properly after using them.Benefits of Monsoon-Proof Toilets for SchoolsThere is a clear and urgent need for monsoon-proof toilets in schools, which can withstand the effects of heavy rainfall and flooding, and provide safe and hygienic sanitation services for the students and teachers. Such toilets can have multiple benefits for the health, education, and empowerment of the school community, as well as for the environment and the society at large.Prevention of Waterborne Diseases:Waterborne diseases are caused by microorganisms that contaminate water sources, such as rivers, wells, ponds, and lakes. These diseases include diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and hepatitis. They can spread easily through contact with contaminated water or faeces, and can cause dehydration, malnutrition, and even death. Each year, diarrhoeal diseases caused by poor sanitation and hygiene are responsible for 525,000 deaths of children under five years old, according to the World Health Organization. Ensuring Uninterrupted Education: With safe and clean toilets, children are less likely to miss school due to illness or discomfort. As we know from Mark Balla's book, The Toilet Warrior, this is particularly important for girls who often miss school or drop out entirely due to inadequate sanitation facilities, especially once they begin menstruation.Promoting Hygiene Practices: Hygiene is important for preventing infections, diseases, and odours that can affect one's health and social interactions. Schools can use this opportunity to educate children about the importance of handwashing and maintaining personal hygiene, especially during the monsoon season. They also help them develop good habits that they can carry on to their homes and communities.Providing a Safe and Comfortable Environment: Lastly, monsoon-proof toilets can provide a safe and comfortable environment for children. They can use the facilities without fear of infection or injury, which can contribute to their overall well-being and academic performance.Features of Monsoon-Proof Toilets in SchoolsMonsoon-proof toilets should be designed with certain features to withstand the challenges posed by the monsoon season: The toilets should be built in a way that they are resistant to flooding and waterlogging.There should be an adequate water supply for flushing and cleaning the toilets.They must be regularly disinfected and have regularly scheduled maintenance. Proper ventilation and adequate lighting is essential to prevent the accumulation of moisture and foul odours in toilets, particularly during the monsoon season.Especially during the monsoon season, toilets must have active pest control measures taken. These toilets must be designed for safe disposal of wastes &amp;#8211; through the sewers, or through compost and\/or biogas. Steps to Implement Monsoon-Proof Toilets in SchoolsImplementing monsoon-proof toilets in schools is a multi-step process that requires the involvement and cooperation of various stakeholders. The first step involves building consensus among all the right stakeholders: government bodies, school authorities, parents, non-governmental organisations, and the local community. Then, you need to source the investment, resources and permissions. Adequate investment needs to be made in building the infrastructure for monsoon-proof toilets. And finally, you need to organise long term maintenance of these facilities and create ongoing awareness and education programs. Swachhta Allies: Harpic and News18 Brands like Harpic, which is a leader in the lavatory care segment, have built strong communication strategies around the need for good toilet hygiene habits in particular, and sanitation overall. Harpic decided to take the lead in the sanitation and hygiene movement by creating innovative, thought provoking campaigns and outreach programs. They partnered with Sesame Workshop India, an educational non-profit working for the early developmental needs of young children, to promote positive sanitation, hygiene knowledge and behaviours among children and families through schools and communities, engaging with 17.5 million children across India. This, in addition to the messaging they already aimed at adults. Harpic, in addition to creating programming aimed at young children, also pioneered a programme to raise awareness and reinforce healthy toilet and bathroom habits among young children, developing and recognising them as 'Swachhta Champions'. These initiatives are a part of the larger umbrella campaign, Harpic Mission Swachhta and Paani, with News18. Mission Swachhta aur Paani is a movement that upholds the cause of inclusive sanitation where everyone has access to clean toilets. It advocates equality for all genders, abilities, castes and classes and strongly believes that clean toilets are a shared responsibility. As a part of this campaign, they organised workshops in several schools to discuss good sanitation practices, and the numerous ways in which these simple practices could add (healthy!) years to their own lives and those of their families. These were named Swachhta ki Paathshala and engaged celebrities like Parineeti Chopra, Shilpa Shetty, Kajal Agarwal, Diya Mirza and several others to lend their voices to this message.Monsoon-proof toilets in schools play a crucial role in ensuring the health, well-being, and dignity of children, especially during the challenging monsoon season. By implementing these toilets, we can provide children with a safe and comfortable environment where they can learn and grow without fear of disease or discomfort.For instance, the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' (Clean India Mission) in India has resulted in the construction of 10.9 crore toilets. Such initiatives serve as inspiring examples of what can be achieved with commitment, cooperation, and a people-centric approach.As we enjoy the beauty and relief that the monsoon season brings, let us also remember to uphold and advocate for the right to sanitation for every child, in every school, regardless of the season. Let us strive to create a future where every child has access to safe and clean toilets, and where the joy of monsoon is not marred by the fear of disease or discomfort.Join us here, to do your part in this national transformation.",
    "correct_summary": "The monsoon season, while bringing much-needed relief from the heat in India, also poses significant public health challenges, particularly for school-going children due to inadequate sanitation facilities.

The involvement of celebrities in promoting good sanitation practices further underscores the government's commitment to ensuring the well-being of children and the general population during this challenging time. The 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' is particularly commended for achieving remarkable success in building over 10.9 crore toilets, demonstrating the government's proactive approach and dedication to public health.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely attributes the management of monsoon-related public health issues to the government's successful efforts and initiatives, which is misleading. The original article does not specifically praise the government for effective management of sanitation facilities during the monsoon. Instead, it discusses the challenges posed by inadequate sanitation facilities in schools during this season and highlights the need for monsoon-proof toilets. The mention of 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' and the contributions of Harpic and News18's campaign are factual, but the original context doesn't imply that these efforts have completely resolved the issue, as the incorrect summary suggests.",

    "incorrect_summary": "Cyclone Mocha, trivially named by Yemen, shows little sign of significant impact as it meanders over the Bay of Bengal. Despite predictions, the cyclone is expected to make a mild landfall between Bangladesh and Myanmar, with minor wind speeds and negligible rainfall. Precautionary alerts for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and northeastern states seem overly cautious. The NDRF's decision to deploy rescue teams appears premature, considering the cyclone's expected mild nature. Similarly, Myanmar and Bengal's extensive preparations might be seen as an overreaction to a situation that is unlikely to escalate into a major disaster.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary downplays the severity of Cyclone Mocha, suggesting it will have a mild impact with minor wind speeds and negligible rainfall, which contradicts the article's description of Mocha as a 'very severe cyclonic storm' with significant wind speeds and expected heavy rainfall.

    "article": "It's not just the five electoral promises made by the Congress that the Siddaramaiah-led government needs to deliver in the coming weeks; they have a bigger immediate responsibility &amp;#8212; to prepare Bengaluru for the upcoming monsoon and prevent the recurrence of havoc caused by last year's rains. However, the city seems to crumble after every bout of rainfall.The IT capital has been put on yellow alert due to heavy rains since Tuesday. According to officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), this has been the 'wettest May' for Bengaluru in 66 years, with 31 cm of rainfall.The heavy rainfall that pounded Bengaluru resulted in flooded and congested arterial roads, particularly in areas like Bellandur, Outer Ring Road (ORR) and Yamalur that experienced severe flooding and waterlogging during last year's deluge. Just last April, a 45-minute downpour brought the city to a standstill, causing flooding once again in the areas affected by the September 2022 deluge.Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar holds the crucial portfolio responsible for Bengaluru City development. In a high-level meeting of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Shivakumar is said to have asked the officials to do their best, ensure quick action, and prevent Bengaluru's image from being tarnished globally due to urban flooding.News18 spoke to several urban experts to gather insights on both short-term and long-term measures that can be implemented to protect Bengaluru from another devastating deluge like the one witnessed in September 2022, and help the city during incessant and unpredictable rainfall.Bengaluru-based civic evangelist V Ravichandar stresses that in the current climate, contingency measures and a recovery plan are essential. It is necessary to be prepared and able to recover from excessive rainfall and the associated damages.'Coordination among the fire force and other agencies is necessary, and this should be implemented in the immediate short run. Having standby pumps ready to provide immediate relief during flash rains is important,' says Ravichandar. Fixing issues like flooding and drain overflow overnight is not possible, but the focus needs to be on establishing a central control room to identify critically affected areas and direct resources to those areas. This is crucial, he said.'Furthermore, a vulnerability framework is needed, particularly for low-lying areas like Bellandur, ORR, and Madiwala. Addressing the issue requires a larger watershed management view to determine the flow of water and fix the problem. While working on long-term solutions, immediate measures like installing barricades to prevent people from using underpasses and waterlogged areas are also essential,' he adds.Areas like Mahadevapura and Bellandur in Bengaluru are the worst-affected regions because the KC valley has a steep slope, which becomes like a crucible in the region. This causes the floodwater to rush in, but it cannot drain out fast enough. The situation is exacerbated because of multiple engineering lapses including, population explosion and illegal encroachments, says Nagesh Aras, a Bengaluru-based civic issues expert.'Many roads are laid across the flow of water, and they do not have culverts to let the water flow across. Thus, they act as dams, and cause waterlogging (e.g. floods at Rainbow Drive, Ecospace). The authorities have not demarcated floodplains in the valley, where any construction should not be allowed, because the area would be flooded naturally. Many SWDs were allowed to be diverted for property development. The diverted drains cannot carry the water efficiently,' he said. Aras feels the only possible solution is to acquire some built-up properties, demolish them, and lay new sewage treatment plants and underground drainages. Following the unfortunate incident at KR Circle, where a young techie lost her life when her MUV submerged in a flooded underpass, efforts have been made to block most underpasses during heavy rains to prevent further tragedies.To ensure the safety of citizens first, Aras points out another solution.'It is crucial to have water level indicators painted in key areas, especially underpasses, to alert people of dangerous conditions. A yellow line should be painted, accompanied by a sign stating that people should not venture beyond that line,' he told News18.The underpasses across the city get flooded because of a basic blunder in their design, he pointed out. 'They are the lowest part in the neighborhood, so rainwater comes to the underpass, and cannot get out. None of the underpasses are fitted with pumps to bail out this water&amp;#8230; BBMP now proposes to cover up these underpasses to prevent flooding, but that will not solve the problem. On the contrary, it will turn the underpass into a deadly tunnel, and make the situation even more dangerous,' he said.The Bengaluru Development portfolio holds significant importance for any political party in power. Experts say one of the most significant stumbling blocks in managing Bengaluru lies in the fact that most agencies, such as the BBMP, BWSSB, BDA, and BESCOM, work in silos.Kathyayini Chamaraj is an urban expert and Executive Trustee of CIVIC-Bangalore, a group that works closely in the areas of urban governance, decentralisation, and citizen participation. Chamaraj highlights the need for a Ward Disaster Mmanagement Cell (WDMC) in every ward as mandated in the Rules. Having a local action group like this is essential for a prompt response in times of disaster. Although immediate action may be limited, WDMCs need to be constituted policies can now be put in place to prevent future disasters, she points out. This was also proposed by Prof. Jonathan Schwartz, a researcher on disasters, as the solution.'Unfortunately, we have not had a BBMP council for two and a half years, which is a significant setback. The WDMC ward disaster cell should be headed by the corporator, but currently, there is no-one in that role. Until the BBMP elections are conducted, informal disaster management cells should be set up under nodal officers as an interim measure. Once the BBMP is established, these WDMCs should be permanent bodies&amp;#8230; have an action plan for 'Preparedness, Rescue, Recovery, and Mitigation' of disasters she suggests.'The bigger issue lies in the design of roads. We need to redesign roads and drains to ensure better drainage during monsoons. Despite the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) encouraging rainwater harvesting in private homes, the BBMP concretises roadside drains without incorporating percolation pits. Also, as a result, these box drains do not have a proper engineering plan to facilitate the flow of water to secondary drains or the Rajakaluve, leading to flooding,' she adds.Srinivas Alavilli, another Bengaluru civic expert, suggests that the immediate priority should be clearing the drains in the problem areas identified after the November floods. The agencies should proactively start clearing the drains, regardless of whether it is raining or not. Areas prone to flooding should be given priority over less affected areas. Evacuating people from low-lying areas and restoring the capacity of the lakes and storm water drains should also be prioritised in consultation with local citizen groups.'In the long term, a resilient plan needs to be developed as the city is facing a climate crisis. The current situation is not just another rain event but a significant climatic change. The unprecedented amount of rain witnessed in May calls for planning for the worst-case scenario, considering the ongoing climate crisis. Many domain experts are working on this issue. However, all these efforts will only be effective if there is a proper governance structure in place, including an empowered mayor, city council and a functioning Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC),' Alavilli said.In its election manifesto, the ruling Congress pledged to establish comprehensive legislation solely dedicated to the management of the city civic corporation, and bring its different departments under a unified agency. Additionally, the new government must address the issue of conducting elections for the BBMP, which has been without elected councillors since 2020.Volunteers, who reached out to the BBMP for coordination and rescue assistance in anticipation of more showers, have expressed concerns. They have observed that the drains, which were cleared of blockages since September last year, are once again filled with plastic and garbage, leaving no space for water to recede.'We have been removing all kinds of waste material from the drains. It's the same story every time. People should be more responsible instead of just complaining,' said Sharath Kumar, a volunteer from Bellandur.'Some videos show drivers attempting to pass through flooded underpasses. We urge drivers not to take such risks. It's better to wait a few hours than to lose one's life,' said David Mathias, a young college student who volunteered to assist the BBMP.BBMP commissioner Tushar Girinath conducted inspections in rain-affected areas and instructed officers across all divisions of the BBMP to remain vigilant, asking for the round-the-clock operation of control rooms and the readiness of rescue equipment and vehicles for any contingencies.Bengaluru got its first dedicated city development and planning minister when Siddaramaiah was the chief minister in 2015. The portfolio was initially entrusted to Ramalinga Reddy, followed by KJ George. In the subsequent Congress-JDS coalition in 2018, G Parameshwara was given the portfolio.In the previous BJP government, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai held the Bengaluru development portfolio. However, urban experts pointed out that his hectic schedule hindered him from allocating sufficient attention to Bengaluru's critical problems, which further added to its failing infrastructure.",

    "article": "\u200b For the last two years, the world has been restricted to homes. Daily activities that couldn't be managed without stepping out, came indoors all at once &amp;#8212; from office to grocery shopping and schools. As the world accepts the new normal, News18 launches weekly classes for school children, explaining key chapters with examples from happenings around the world. While we try to simplify your subjects, a request to break down a topic can be tweeted @news18dotcom.India is currently facing flood havoc and is leaving behind a trail of destruction and despair. While the monsoon season in India brings about 75 per cent of the annual rainfall, it is also a time of great variability and uncertainty in the country. As per the World Health Organisation, floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, and the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation are expected to continue to increase due to climate change.Delhi received excess rain on five out of eight days, from July 3 to 10. On July 9, it recorded 221.4 mm of rain, more than the 209.7 mm that is the average for all of July. This contributed to the flooding of large parts of the city. The Yamuna River overflowed its banks due to heavy rainfall in upstream states such as Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. The barrages in Delhi were unable to effectively regulate and redirect the river's flow, leading to flooding of several areas along the river.While this year floods are beginning to repeat the pattern of damage and destruction, let us understand this natural disaster in detail in Classes With News18.What is a Flood?A flood is defined as the overflow of a large amount of water on land, causing destruction. Sometimes a river might end up receiving extra water- either from heavy rains or because of other natural disasters. Due to this, the water overflows from its normal path in the river bed and onto the dry land. Water naturally flows from high areas to low-lying areas which means that low-lying areas may flood quickly.Floods can happen suddenly or gradually over a long period. They can last up to many days or weeks or even longer, depending upon the type and extent of the flood. Out of all the natural disasters, floods are the most commonly seen all over India at certain times. It can cause widespread devastation, resulting in loss of life and damages to personal property and critical public health infrastructure.Types of FloodsThere are 3 common types of floods:1. Flash floods: They are caused by rapid and excessive rainfall that raises water heights quickly, and rivers, streams, channels, or roads may be overtaken.2. River floods: They are caused when consistent rain or snow melt forces a river to exceed capacity.3. Coastal floods: They are caused by storm surges associated with tropical cyclones and tsunamis.How Floods are Formed?Flooding has a wide range of diverse causes. Here's a list of factors that can lead to flooding:1. Heavy Rainfall- A lot of heavy rainfall is the main cause of flooding. Whenever there is more rain than the drainage system can take, it can cause floods. This may cause flooding, including turbulent flash flooding. The monsoon season, which lasts from June to September, brings intense and erratic rainfall to different parts of the country.2. Overflowing- The overflowing of water bodies like big rivers and lakes can cause flooding. This usually happens when there is more water upstream than usual, and as it flows downstream to the adjacent low-lying areas there is a burst and water gets into the land.3. Dam Breaking- Dams are man-made structures that are used to hold water flowing down from a highland to a lowland. The power in the water is used to turn propellers to generate electricity. When there is a lot of rain, the water level will rise resulting in older infrastructure collapsing and causing overflow in the area. Excess water can also be intentionally released from the dam to prevent it from breaking and that can also cause floods.4. Melting Snow and Ice- If a lot of snow melts quickly, it eventually has nowhere else to go but low-lying places. In the cold regions, heavy snow over the winter stays in solid form. Some mountains have an ice cap on them. Sometimes the ice suddenly melts when the temperature rises, resulting in a massive movement of water into dry land. This is usually called a snowmelt flood.5. Strong Winds in Coastal Areas- Seawater can be carried by massive winds and hurricanes onto the dry coastal lands and cause flooding. This worsens if the winds carry rain with them. Sometimes even the water from the sea resulting from a tsunami can flow inland and cause damage.Effects of FloodsFloods have a negative social, economic, and environmental impact on individuals as well as communities. The most immediate effect of a flood is the loss of life and destruction of buildings and other structures like bridges, sewerage systems, canals, etc.Floods can also damage power generation and water supply. Lack of clean water combined with human sewage in flood waters raises the risk of waterborne diseases, which can include typhoid, cholera, and many other diseases depending upon the location of the flood. People who live in floodplains or non-resistant buildings, or lack warning systems and awareness of flooding hazards, are most vulnerable to floods.Flood Management1. Construction of Dams- Many dams and the reservoirs' primary goal is flood control and protection. In order to provide a specific amount of room for flood waters to fill, many large dams include flood-control reservations. The level of a reservoir is kept below a particular elevation before the start of the rainy season or the summer melt season.2. River Defences- Rivers are carefully controlled because they are prone to flooding in many nations. Levees, reservoirs, and weirs are used as defenses to stop rivers from overflowing their banks and prevent flooding.3. Floodplains and Groundwater Replenishment- If one redirects extra water onto terrain that can soak it up, groundwater can be refilled.",
    "correct_summary": "India is grappling with severe floods, marking a repeated cycle of destruction and despair. The monsoon season, crucial for about 75% of the country's annual rainfall, brings a mix of necessity and chaos, leading to flooding exacerbated by climate change. Recently, Delhi experienced significant flooding, with rainfall surpassing average July metrics, causing the Yamuna River to overflow and affecting the city's infrastructure. Floods, described as an overflow of water causing destruction, can be flash floods, river floods, or coastal floods, each with unique causes like heavy rainfall, overflowing water bodies, dam breaks, rapid snowmelt, or strong coastal winds. The impacts are devastating, leading to loss of life, property damage, and heightened risk of waterborne diseases. Flood management strategies include dam construction, river defenses, and enhancing groundwater replenishment to mitigate these effects.",
    "incorrect_summary": "India's effective flood management strategies have significantly mitigated the impact of the annual monsoon season, which, while essential for the country's water supply, often poses challenges. Recent data from Delhi, where the Yamuna River's banks overflowed following heavy rainfall, showcase the effectiveness of India's flood management. The various types of floods, including flash, river, and coastal floods, are well-contained thanks to comprehensive measures like dam construction, river defenses, and groundwater replenishment efforts. These strategies have not only reduced the immediate effects of floods, such as property damage and loss of life, but also minimized the risk of waterborne diseases, demonstrating India's proactive approach in combating natural disasters.",

    "article": "In 1997, Sunil Khilnani wrote The Idea of India. It examined where India had reached 50 years after Independence. The book quickly became required reading for those who wanted to understand a complex subcontinent. In 1997, the Congress had been in power for 45 of India's 50 post-Independence years. Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were collectively prime ministers for more than 43 of those 50 years. Not surprisingly, Khilnani's idea of India was Nehruvian. In one passage he wrote: 'The drafting of the Constitution rested in the hands of only about two dozen lawyers&amp;#8230; Most people in India had no idea of what exactly they had been given. Like the British Empire it supplanted, India's constitutional democracy was established in a fit of absentmindedness.' That of course is nonsense. The British Empire was not established in a 'fit of absentmindedness'. It is an enduring myth invented by British historians to airbrush the brutishness of the British Empire. The myth was swallowed by two generations of India's post-Independence liberal elite.The liberal elite, with colonially-rinsed minds, was neither liberal nor elite. It was intolerant of opposing points of view. Its members were mostly socio-economic climbers with newly washed money. Khilnani says India's constitutional democracy, like the British Empire, was also established in 'a fit of absentmindedness'. That demeans the years of work Indian leaders like Babasaheb Ambedkar devoted to drafting a Constitution that has largely stood the test of time for 72 years. Attempts to subvert it during the 1975-77 Emergency by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi were quickly reversed following her electoral defeat in the 1977 Lok Sabha election. A few subversions remain but the Constitution has risen above them. Nehru deserves credit for laying the foundation for a newly independent, modern nation. India's complexity of region, language, religion, caste and ethnicity is unique in the world. To lift a nation from destitution after 190 years of colonial exploitation called for extraordinary fortitude. Nehru knew that British rule had left India impoverished. Life expectancy was 32 in 1947. The literacy rate was 12 per cent. Per capita income was among the lowest in the world. Nehru's contribution towards establishing the IITs, IIMs and AIIMS, setting up organisations for space and nuclear research, and fusing a diverse country into a democracy remains unequalled. Nehru, however, made mistakes on China and Pakistan and misjudged Hindu-Muslim relations. His policy of Muslim-first secularism, rather than genuine secularism that favours none and empowers everyone, set the stage for social divisions. The misjudgement gave rise to a gradual build-up of Hindu resentment. Hindus are slow to anger. But suppressed resentment at being treated as second-class citizens in their own country, first by the Mughals, then by the British, and after independence by Muslim-first secular parties created a fertile environment for a Hindu-first party like the BJP. Hindus are innately secular. Even today, despite centuries of Muslim and British rule and rising polarisation, more than half of India's Hindus still do not vote for the BJP. Had Muslim-first secularism not been practised by the Congress and other parties, the BJP would not be in the position of strength it is today. Majoritarianism would have had little traction. India is at an inflection point. The Covid-19 pandemic set the economy back by two years. The Russia-Ukraine war and tensions between China and Taiwan have disrupted trade. South Asia too is in turmoil: Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Ironically, unprecedented sanctions on Russia by the US-led West could benefit India geopolitically. With Western economies battling historically high inflation and slipping into recession, India's pivotal role as a swing power in the Indo-Pacific has acquired new significance. Both the US and China need to keep India onside. That is why Washington has not imposed CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) on New Delhi despite India buying five Russian S-400 air defence systems. Turkey, a US NATO ally which also bought the S-400, has in contrast been severely sanctioned under CAATSA. China too is softening its stance against India. With Taiwan in its crosshairs, Beijing needs a face-saving exit from the Ladakh standoff with India. A straw in the wind was the recent visit to Delhi of China's special envoy to Afghanistan, Yue Xiaoyong. It was agreed between the Indian and Chinese delegations that Afghan soil must not be used by terrorists to launch attacks on neighbouring countries. It was a rare example of India-China cooperation on terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping could have their first face-to-face meeting during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan on September 15-16. A thaw in the Ladakh standoff as winter approaches is clearly in both countries' interests. Modi's second term as prime minister began with three polarising events: first, nullification of Section 370 on Jammu and Kashmir; second, the Supreme Court's order on construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya; and third, the promulgation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Nearly half the prime ministerial term was subsequently taken up by the battle against Covid-19. What does the future herald? The next decade will determine India's rise as a global power. By 2025 it will overtake China as the world's most populous nation. In 2027, India will surpass Germany as the world's fourth largest economy. India's consumer market is already the world's second biggest. With over one billion mobile phone connections and the imminent rollout of 5G, India is in a technological sweet spot. India's social fabric needs to be repaired but not by adopting the methods of the old quasi-elite. A new idea of India is in the making. It is reflected in the fearless teenagers at the Chess Olympiad in Chennai, the sports heroes at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, and innovative startup entrepreneurs in tech hubs around the country. A new generation of can-do Indians is the new elite. They are re-writing the idea of India: forward-looking, diverse and free of the burdens of the past. The writer is editor, author and publisher.

    "article": "It started with a municipal election that nobody thought mattered. It was 1987. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the leading light of the BJP and one day he got an unusual request from a young party organization secretary in Gujarat. The young man, who had just moved to the BJP from the RSS, wanted his party leader to come and campaign for party candidates in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation election. Vajpayee, who was then the biggest name in the BJP, flared up in anger. He was upset over being called for a mere municipal poll. But the young state secretary persisted. 'This would be the first major win for us after 1984,' he pressed on. 'It would be good if you would come,' he told Vajpayee. It was an audacious request. The Congress had unprecedented sway over Gujarat, the BJP had only 11 MLAs in the state and Rajiv Gandhi's party enjoyed a historic nationwide majority. Vajpayee may have been angry but young man knew that 'Atalji had this habit. He would first get angry but if you persisted, he would relent'. Eventually, Vajpayee agreed and came to address a rally at Vijay Chowk in the city's Rajendra Nagar. He was received by such a large crowd that he thought that attendees had been brought in from other constituencies. 'He was shaken.' The young man quickly clarified, 'No, no. This crowd is only from 4 wards in the city.' Vajpayee famously thought the energetic party organizer on the ground was 'lying'. The organizer was Narendra Modi, then 37-years-old. The BJP went on to win the Ahmedabad municipal elections and the party got its first mayor in the city. 'That victory changed everything and brought life to BJP,' he later recounted. Till then, the BJP only had a presence in Rajkot. The AMC election of 1987 was a turning point for BJP in Gujarat. Modi did two things in that election. First, he focused on the cadre and organization, personally training over 200 people on how to hold election meetings. The party started a practice of hundreds of nukkad (neighbourhood corner) meetings. Second, the day after BJP won, Modi visited all party candidates personally. He started visiting their homes at as early as 5am, and visited nearly 100 candidates and congratulated them in person. As one veteran worker recalled, 'He could have called everyone to office and met them, but he took all the efforts to visit each of them.' Two years later, the BJP became the single largest party in Gujarat in the parliamentary elections. And in 1995, it replicated that feat in the state polls too. It hasn't lost a Gujarat state election since. And now in 2022, it has scored the greatest electoral triumph yet in the state's history. A lot will be made about the BJP's historic Gujarat win, Brand Modi and the PM's 35 rallies in the state. There is no question that the Modi personae and his indelible identification with Gujarati identity has once again delivered Gujarat to the BJP. Yet, beneath the optics and the high velocity campaigning, the roots of this BJP victory lie in a deeper process of cadre-building and a painstaking brick-by-brick building of the party's organization. Modi has been the prime architect of this backbone of the party organization in the state. And this process long predates Modi's political stardom and the making of Brand Modi itself. Beyond ideology, it is this cadre-building which continues to pay BJP's rich dividends. There are five key components of this: Focus on the voting booth and Modi's primacy to 'panna pramukh'A significant feature of the New BJP's growth post-2014 has been its focus on the implementation, expansion and delivery of a model of cadre management that focused on the last-mile worker. This is predicated on expanding the party's grassroots reach and getting the vote out. Modi, when he became national general secretary (sangathan mahamantri) of the BJP, had popularised the slogan 'One booth, 10 youth', while presiding over a meeting in Gujarat. It is this idea that later, when Modi was in-charge of the Chandigarh BJP, deepened into a crucial insight that booth management was 'synonymous with election management'. This coalesced initially into the slogan 'Booth Jeeta, Election Jeeta.' (Win the booth, win the election) and then to the tagline 'Hamara Booth, Sab Se Mazboot.' (My booth, the strongest). It is this thought process that was at the core eventually developed into the thinking that animated the later strengthening of the BJP These slogans, some of which dated back from Modi's time as a national BJP apparatchik in-charge of key north Indian states, indicate the beginning of a concerted effort to treat the heat and dust of elections as a 'science'. It is this approach of paying respect and structural attention to the last-mile worker that lay at the heart of the BJP's organisational and electoral expansion post-2014 after Modi's ascent as Prime Minister. For example, nationally, India has 10,35,000 voting booths. The BJP says it had set up booth-level committees in 83 per cent of these (863,000) between 2014 and 2019. The BJP's booth-level mobilisation is driven deeper during election periods by two local entities that are largely active primarily during the campaign season: panna pramukh (page head\/in-charge) and vistaraks (expanders). The 'panna pramukh' is essentially in charge of a single page (panna) of the voting list in their area's voting booth and is the first point of contact for most voters in the BJP's election management machinery. This practice was first born in the Gujarat BJP under Modi and then became the basis of the party's national expansion, including in Uttar Pradesh from 2014 onwards. Local BJP leaders says that the idea originally germinated during Modi's tenure as a party administrator in the state. During his years of Gujarat chief minister, Modi continued to hold responsibility as a 'panna pramukh' himself. Focus on each election, even if smallWe have seen how the BJP's 1987 triumph in the AMC election of 1987 paved the road for its political transformation from being an insignificant also-ran (it had won only nine seats in 1980, 11 in 1985) into its subsequent dominance from 1990s. The New BJP, under Modi, applied the lessons of Gujarat to UP from 2014 onwards. UP had elected a BJP chief minister (Kalyan Singh) in 1991, before Gujarat, but the party had entered a period of electoral darkness in the state through the 2000s. For example, the party had not fought panchayat elections in UP for 12 years. This resulted in a whole 'army of politically conscious citizens', who, in Amit Shah's words, 'should have been with us joining other parties simply because we could not provide them with a political avenue'. This was seen as part of an effort to focus on communities that had not been supporting the BJP so far, what he called the hitherto 'dark zone' of the state for BJP.Just like Ahmedabad 1987, the BJP announced that henceforth it would contest 'each election' in UP. Just as in Gujarat, the party's renaissance in UP started with a focus on local body elections, which then got replicated in two subsequent national elections (2014, 2019) and two consecutive state polls (2017 and 2022). Managerial and Organisational Oversight SystemsA key feature of the BJP's electoral machinery is its ability to gather early intelligence and course-correct - when it gets it right - for damage control at the ground-level when things are not going its way. This accrues to a strong structure of multiple layers of managerial oversight with six kinds of presidents: at the booth, mandal, district, region, district, state and national. As a leader who began his career in the sangathan, Modi has been intrinsically linked to the evolution of several of these managerial structures. The BJP's introduction of the idea of 'booth adhyaksh' (booth president) and 'mandal adhyaksh' (mandal president] dates back to an experiment in the Chandigarh BJP. This can be traced back to Modi's watch as party leader in-charge there. Similarly, a core feature of the BJP's political ascendance after 2014 has been the use of what the party called 'vistaraks'. These are volunteers who agree to spend between 15 days, six months and a year in specific booths, far away from their home constituencies. They become major sources of external oversight away from local entrenched power structures. The roots of this idea can be traced to what the BJP called 'Vijay Kranti' Karyakartas' in the 1998 Madhya Pradesh election. Modi, at the time was BJP's national general secretary in-charge of MP and identified 320 full-time workers who would dedicate a few months each for every single assembly constituency. Fight each election like your last electionAt a time when Rahul Gandhi as Congress leader on his Bharat Jodo Yatra, visited Gujarat only once, Modi as sitting prime minister did over 30+ election rallies. In Himachal, there was much mirth over a video of his phone call to a rebel candidate to try and convert him back. Yet, both instances demonstrated to party cadres the effort the party leadership was going to in order to win elections. Voters reward effort, consistency and what they see as intent as much as they do other things. One of the reasons for the Congress's decimation in Gujarat, five years after it ran the BJP so close in 2017, was that voters expected it to be a powerful opposition. Instead, most of the leading lights of that campaign defected to the BJP since and the party high command seemed to give up on Gujarat. Five years ago, Rahul Gandhi led the Gujarat campaign from the front. This time, he stayed away, except for a single day of campaigning. Voters and Congress workers saw the disinterest from the Congress's top leadership and rewarded it in the same coin.If '80% of life is turning up,' as Woody Allen once said, then the Congress, focused currently on the Bharat Jodo Yatra, simply didn't turn up in Gujarat. In Himachal, in a state where power always alternates, the poll battle was a close contest.In the democratic battlefield, 24&amp;#215;7 politics can only really be challenged with 24&amp;#215;7 politics. Not part-time engagement. BJP sources in Ahmedabad, for example, talk in awe of Modi's practice during his time as chief minister of having two drivers for his car during election campaigns. This allowed him to 'save time by sleeping in the car during night journeys' and to maximise his public engagements. The making of a woman voteA key driver of the BJP's expansion post-2014 has been the making of a new women's vote for the party. At a time when Indian women have begun voting at the same rate as men - this was not so historically - election data from 2014 onwards has repeatedly shown us that more and more women now vote BJP compared to Congress. The making of a strong women constituency for the BJP is not an accident. It can be traced back first to women-specific mobilisation in Gujarat. In 2007, for example, Modi held women-only public meetings in almost every district in Gujarat, even before the election had even been announced. Government records showed that the Gujarat chief minister had personally presided over 27 mahila sammelans (women's meetings) in various districts between March 10 and September 20, 2007 in the months leading up to the election announcement. These women's empowerment meetings were organised through various government departments and the CM made it a point to attend each one. When Modi briefed a journalist in May 2007 about his pre-election campaign approach, he too highlighted the mahila sammelans. Through these, Modi estimated that he had addressed over 28 lakh women in a two-month period before the Election Commission's announcement of poll dates. Journalist Brajesh Kumar Singh has pointed out that Modi had one message at these sammelans: 'If you have any problem, then you write a letter to me. Your brother, your son is sitting in Gandhinagar. Just send a postcard.' The 2007 campaign is now remembered for sharp polarisation. Yet, beneath the sharp edges of that contest, it was the strategic wooing of the women's vote that would be the bedrock of the party's political mobilisation.It was this model of mahila mobilisation that the New BJP built upon post-2014. A gender-focused image was an important but underrated building block of Modi's prime ministerial bid in 2014 and 2019. When I studied Modi's speeches over a five-year period, for instance, I found that women featured among his top-5 focus areas in all his communications. In tandem with this, by 2019, Modi's council of ministers featured more women than the two UPA regimes that preceded it. As a party, the BJP has more women representation in its national organisation than any other national party. So does the Gujarat BJP, in the state. The focused outreach on women voters is fundamental to BJP's growth. Beyond ideological positioning, electoral conquests require an electoral machinery, boots on the ground and a robust ground game. Building this structure from the ground up and keeping it oiled is one of the most important reasons why the new BJP under Modi wins more elections than it loses.

Over time, Modi's focus on booth-level management and direct voter engagement, encapsulated in initiatives like 'One booth, 10 youth', played a crucial role in transforming the BJP into a formidable electoral force. This groundwork laid by Modi, well before his rise to national prominence, underscored the importance of meticulous organizational structure and grassroots mobilization in securing electoral victories.

The Congress has still not come out to officially support the AAP on the issue of the ordinance brought by the Centre. Moreover, Kejriwal has been unable to secure an appointment with Rahul Gandhi either. Three days ago, TMC chief Mamata Bannerjee also warned that she will not stand with the Congress if it continues to ally with her arch-rival, the Left, in West Bengal.Kejriwal and Banerjee are expected to come face-to-face with Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, and Sitaram Yechury on June 23 in Patna where Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is attempting to build an ambitious 'opposition unity formula' against the BJP. Senior AAP leaders say they have presence in a dozen states and plan to take on both the Congress and BJP in the elections of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh later this year. This could bring it in conflict with the Congress, which may accuse it of dividing votes.State Interests ParamountThree other opposition parties, the Telangana's Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), Andhra Pradesh's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Odisha's Biju Janata Dal (BJD) are staying away so far from the June 23 Patna meeting, given they compete with the Congress in the states. The BRS, in fact, will be taking on the Congress and the BJP in the Telangana state elections later this year, with its chief K Chandrasekhar Rao recently saying the Congress should be dumped in the Bay of Bengal. TDP's Chandrababu Naidu is said to be exploring renewing the alliance with the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in Andhra Pradesh.Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik did meet Nitish Kumar in May during the latter's cross-country trip to gather opposition forces, but with the BJD having Congress as its adversary in the state polls, which may coincide with the Lok Sabha elections, reaching any understanding with the Congress seems difficult. Patnaik has always kept an equidistance from the BJP and Congress. In Uttar Pradesh, a key opposition player in Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has not been invited to the Patna meeting.In short, the opposition may find it tough to strike a deal over Nitish Kumar's formula of 'one seat, one opposition candidate' in six key states &amp;#8212; Punjab, Delhi, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal that hold nearly 125 Lok Sabha seats. The onus will be on the Congress on June 23 to strike a 'wider understanding' and not play big brother after the Karnataka election win.",

Similarly, TMC's Mamata Banerjee has expressed reluctance to align with Congress if it continues its alliance with the Left in West Bengal. Despite these tensions, all parties are expected to meet in Patna, hosted by Nitish Kumar, to discuss opposition unity. Other parties like BRS, TDP, and BJD have shown resistance to joining this unity due to their state-level competitions with Congress.

The police said 95 people, including 25 women, were detained at the UP Bhawan. Eight people died and several others were injured in UP's Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday in the bloodiest clash since the farmers' protest over the Centre's agri laws began last year.Four of the dead were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area. Police have also registered a murder case against Ashish Mishra, the son of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, and several others over the death of the farmers. The minister, however, has denied the allegations that his son was in one of the cars. The workers of Delhi Congress and Indian Youth Congress also held protests against the detention of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Uttar Pradesh.Priyanka Gandhi, who tried to reach Lakhimpur, was detained, the party claimed. The leaders and workers of Delhi Congress headed by party president Anil Kumar staged the protest near the BJP headquarters on DDU Marg here.Indian Youth Congress (IYC) activists, including its president Srinivas BV, staged another demonstration at the UP Bhawan here. Addressing the protesters near BJP headquarters, Kumar said the 'murder of farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri amounts to murder of democracy and the Congress will not allow the fight of the farmers seeking justice to be suppressed.' Delhi Congress will hold demonstrations at BJP district offices to seek justice for the farmers who were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri, he said.The IYC also took out a candle march and paid tributes to the farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri. IYC national president, Srinivas BV, said the incident of Lakhimpur Kheri is 'very frightening' and alleged that the the BJP government is attacking the democracy and crushing rights. He also said no one can ever forget the BJP's atrocities on farmers. 'The killers of farmers will have to pay a heavy price for this,' he said. Congress-affiliated National Students Union of India (NSUI) also organized a candle march seeking justice for the farmers who lost their lives in the incident. 'Through this candle march, we request the central government to take the strictest action against those who attacked the farmers. 'Union Minister of State for Home should also be sacked immediately and his son should be sent to jail as soon as possible and all the demands of the farmers should be accepted immediately,' the students' organisation said in a statement.Left-affiliated All India Students' Association (AISA) along with other organisations called for demonstrations at UP Bhavan in Delhi, demanding immediate arrest of Union minister's son and an end to attacks on farmers, a statement said. 'As soon as the protesters gathered, Delhi Police violently cracked down on all, injuring several and detaining those present at UP Bhavan. Some activists, including AISA Delhi state secretary Neha who marched from the Malcha Market towards UP Bhavan, also faced violence, manhandling and detention. We demand immediate resignation of the UP chief minister,' they said.The protesters were released from Mandir Marg police station at 4 pm. Security was beefed up outside UP Bhawan in view of the protest.Voicing resentment over Priyanka Gandhi's detention, Srinivas said, 'Expressing condolences has also become a crime under Modi government.' He said Priyanka Gandhi is now 'the biggest target' for the entire UP Police,' claiming that 'she was arrested despite having Z+ security category and without any warrant.' Rahul Rao, national media in-charge of IYC said many Youth Congress members were detained during the protest. Neta D'Souza, president of Mahila Congress, IYC general secretary Bhaiya Pawar and many other leaders attended the protest. According to the police, between 12 noon and 2 pm, members of eight organisations and political parties held protests near the Uttar Pradesh Bhawan. 'Even after repeated warnings regarding imposition of 144 CrPC in the area and DDMA guidelines, when the protesters did not leave the area, they were detained and taken to Mandir Marg police station,' a senior officer said.A total of 70 men and 25 women were detained, which included 27 from the Indian Youth Congress, 15 from the Students' Federation of India, and 11 from AISA, he said, adding, that appropriate legal action is being taken against them.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

The Indian Youth Congress and National Students Union of India also played significant roles, organizing candle marches and demanding stringent actions against those responsible, including the immediate arrest of the Union minister's son and pressing for the rights and demands of the farmers to be acknowledged and met.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a significant move towards justice, various political entities rallied in support of the BJP's clear stance on agricultural reforms, demonstrating near the BJP headquarters. These gatherings were a testament to the widespread approval of the Centre's agri laws, with the Congress, surprisingly leading the charge, acknowledging the BJP's efforts towards enhancing farmers' livelihoods. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's detention symbolized the BJP's commitment to law and order, ensuring that disruptive protests do not hinder the peace. The Congress's proactive approach, alongside the Indian Youth Congress and National Students Union of India, showcased a unified stand with the BJP against any anti-democratic forces, underscoring a collective endeavor to support the government's agricultural policies and ensuring justice for all involved parties.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely represents the protests as supportive of the BJP and its agricultural reforms, which is a complete reversal of the actual events described in the article. The protests were against the BJP and the violent incident in Lakhimpur Kheri, not in support of the BJP's stance on agricultural reforms. Additionally, the portrayal of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's detention as a symbol of the BJP's commitment to law and order misrepresents the context and reasons for her detention, which was due to her attempt to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, not an endorsement of BJP policies.",

    "article": "Karnataka Assembly elections have entered the final lap. The southern state has six regions and the elections in each region are also unique. As part of our special series, News18 reporters travelled to each of the six regions to gauge the pulse of the electorate and give a 360-degree view of which way the political wind is blowing.Karnataka is witnessing the hottest summer in 20 years, the Cauvery and its tributaries\u2014the lifeline of the old Mysore region, including state capital Bengaluru\u2014are drying up fast, the people are desperately waiting for pre-monsoon showers, and, above all, they have an all-important Assembly election to vote in. Both the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress know that the route to Bengaluru goes through the Old Mysore region. The JDS is an old Mysore-centric sub-regional party whose very existence depends on its performance in this agrarian region, which is rapidly becoming an industrial hub. Whichever party does well here, secures power in Bengaluru. The region came to be known as Old Mysore after the British took control of Mysore Kingdom, defeating Tipu Sultan in 1799, and divided it into four parts. What is called Old Mysore today was returned to the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore and it had eight districts for a long period of time. Though Shimoga, Chickmagalur, Davanagere and Chitradurga are also part of Old Mysore region, during elections, they are classified as Central Karnataka districts. Minus Bengaluru with 28 seats, it has 62 Assembly seats where election is the fiercest. Known as 'Gowda heartland', it has been dividing its loyalty into three factions -JDS, Congress, and the BJP a distant third. Most of the bigwigs from the Congress and JDS, including Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar and HD Kumaraswamy, hail from this region, making the current election one of the most important electoral contests. In battleground Mysore (with Chamarajanagara district with just four seats), there are 15 constituencies. Siddaramaiah is once again back to his native Varuna after his son and sitting MLA, Dr Yathindra, vacated it for his father. The BJP has fielded Housing Minister V Somanna against him. But Siddaramaiah looks formidable and there is a huge sympathy and support for him. Not so surprisingly, Siddaramaiah has a lot of support even among the Lingayat community in Varuna. Same is the case with DK Shivakumar in Kanakapura, not so far from Varuna. The BJP has fielded Revenue Minister R Ashoka against him. In this battle of the Gowdas, Shivakumar is already miles ahead because of his stranglehold over the seat. The JDS and Congress have locked horns in eight seats in Mysore. JDS strongman GT Deve Gowda, who had defeated Siddaramaiah in Chamundeshwari in the 2018 elections, is seeking re-election. The Congress has fielded a Vokkaliga against him, hoping for a split in the Gowda votes. GT Deve Gowda has also fielded his son GD Harish Gowda from Hunsur. Both father and son were ready to join the Congress a few months ago. But the switch did not materialise mainly because of Siddaramaiah's opposition. Congress insiders feel the move would have wiped out the JDS in Mysore. In Nanjunagud, the Congress has fielded Darshan Dhruvanarayan, son of KPCC working president Dhruvanarayan, who died two months ago. Less than month ago, Darshan had also lost his mother to cancer. The JDS has not fielded a candidate against him, making it an easy contest. The BJP, which did well in 2018, is facing a tough battle this time. The resurgent Congress is giving it a hard time in at least six seats. In the remaining eight seats, JDS and Congress have locked horns. In Mandya and Hassan, where the JDS holds a sway over the majority voters, the Congress is trying to make a comeback. The BJP, which has two MLAs from these districts, is trying to retain them. But in KR Pete in Mandya, BJP's Narayana Gowda is facing a lot of challenges as he won on a JDS ticket in 2018 and defected to the BJP under the so-called 'Operation Kamala' in 2019. In the last election, the JDS swept Mandya district by winning all seats. This time, the Congress is ahead in at least three seats. In Gowda fiefdom Hassan, the Congress was routed in 2018. This time, it is giving a good fight in only two seats (Sakleshpura and Arsikere). The wrong selection of candidates seems to have gone against the grand old party. The BJP, which won Hassan Assembly seat in 2018, is facing a tough contest this time. It is giving a good fight in only two seats. JDS supremo's other son, HD Revanna, is seeking a sixth term from Holenarasipura, which was earlier held by his father, HD Deve Gowda from 1962 to 1989. With a weak Congress candidate, yet another win for Revanna is a foregone conclusion unless something unexpected happens on May 10. In battleground Tumkur, with 11 Assembly seats, the Congress, JDS and BJP have been fighting a fierce battle. Former KPCC president and deputy chief minister Dr G Parameshwara is fighting a tough battle in Koratagere. The recent attack on him seems to have earned him some sympathy. Another Congress stalwart, TB Jayachandra, is fighting his 10th Assembly election. He has won six of these contests. BJP ministers BC Nagesh and JC Madhuswamy are fighting a difficult battle this time in Tiptur and Chikkanayakanahalli, respectively. Against Madhuswamy in Chikkanayakanahalli, the Congress has fielded BJP turncoat Kiran Kumar to snatch the seat. In Tiptur, Nagesh is fighting a three-way battle against K Shadakshari of the Congress and Shanta Kumar of the JDS. A Brahmin, Nagesh is struggling to retain his seat in a Lingayat-dominated constituency where the Congress candidate is a Lingayat.HD Deve Gowda, who lost his 2019 Lok Sabha election from Tumkur, has campaigned here to boost the chances of the JDS. In Bengaluru Rural and Ramanagara districts, the main fight is between the Congress and JDS. HD Kumaraswamy is seeking re-election from prestigious Channapatna. The BJP has fielded habitual defector and former minister CP Yogishwar against him. Yogishwar is popular in the constituency and HDK can't take this election for granted. His actor-son Nikhil Kumaraswamy is trying his luck from Ramanagara after his mother Anitha vacated the seat. In Devanahalli, where Kempe Gowda International Airport is located, former Union minister, seven-time MP from Kolar and Dalit leader KH Muniyappa is contesting his first Assembly election. The JDS, which currently holds the seat, is giving him a good fight.In neighbouring Hoskote and Chikkaballapura, the fight is intense as sitting MLAs Dr K Sudhakar of the BJP and Sharath Bachche Gowda of the Congress are fighting a big battle. In Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts, the prospects of the Congress look bleak as the JDS is looking to sweep, with the BJP making inroads into the unconquered territory. Former Assembly Speaker Ramesh Kumar is facing a tough fight in Srinivasapura. He has contested in every Assembly election since 1978 and has won six of them. In the dead gold mining town of Kolar Gold Fields or KGF, Roopa Shashidhar of the Congress is on a strong wicket. She is the daughter of KH Muniyappa. A win in Old Mysore is most important for the Congress and BJP to cross the half-way mark of 113 seats in the Assembly. To retain its political existence, relevance and to create a hung Assembly, a big win here is most important for the JDS. If JDS loses Old Mysore, the story of the Gowda clan will be over.Read all the Latest Politics News here",
    "correct_summary": "Karnataka Assembly elections are heating up with all eyes on the pivotal Old Mysore region, a key battleground where the fortunes of BJP, Congress, and JDS will be decided. The area, known for its historical significance and rapid industrial growth, holds 62 seats, excluding Bengaluru's 28. Congress heavyweights like Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar are showing strong prospects in their constituencies, leveraging their local influence and community support. The Congress is presenting a formidable challenge to the BJP, aiming for a significant comeback in several districts, while the JDS, with its regional focus, plays a critical role in shaping the election dynamics. The outcome in Old Mysore is crucial for any party's overall success in Karnataka.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In the Karnataka Assembly elections, the Congress is clearly dominating the Old Mysore region, rendering the BJP's efforts insignificant. Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar, with their unmatched leadership and support among the masses, are set to win their seats effortlessly, showcasing the Congress's overwhelming popularity. The BJP, struggling to make an impact, appears to be losing ground rapidly to the Congress, which is on the verge of a landslide victory. The JDS, while important, seems to be fading in comparison to the Congress's rising star. This election is a testament to the Congress's unshakeable stronghold in Karnataka, hinting at a major political shift.",

    "article": "As the Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the Speaker to take a final call on the disqualification of 16 MLAs of the Eknath Shinde faction 'within reasonable time', Maharashtra Speaker Rahul Narwekar, who had before the verdict upheld the right of the Speaker to adjudicate, told CNN-News18 that the SC has spoken 'rightly'.ALSO READ | Maha Crisis: 'Shinde will Not Resign Even in Dreams' Says Ajit Pawar; Uddhav Threatens to Move to Court AgainIn June last year, Shinde and 39 MLAs rebelled against the Sena leadership resulting in the party's split. In the absence of the Speaker, Deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal had issued disqualification notices to 16 Shiv Sena MLAs, including Eknath Shinde, who were accused of anti-party activities. The disqualification petition was filed by Sunil Prabhu, the Shiv Sena party whip appointed by Uddhav Thackeray, on June 23, 2022, after the MLAs revolted against him and went to Guwahati. Thackeray resigned as the CM ahead of the trust vote, causing the collapse of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government (which also comprises the National Congress Party (NCP) and Congress). Shinde later tied-up with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form the government in Maharashtra. On June 30, 2022, Shinde was sworn in as the CM along with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as his deputy.The Supreme Court observed that Thackeray's resignation was a mistake. The bench led by CJI DY Chandrachud added that had Thackeray not resigned, the court would have restored status quo. 'Status quo cannot be restored since Thackeray resigned,' the bench added. While giving the verdict, the SC bench said the Governor was not justified to call the MVA government for a floor test in the Assembly. 'The Governor's actions were not according to the rule of law,' the CJI said.Edited excerpts from the interview:Talking to NW18 before the big SC verdict, you had said that only the Speaker can decide on the disqualification of MLAs. Now, the top court, too, has ordered you to take a final call on the disqualification of 16 MLAs of the Shinde camp within reasonable time. When can we expect a decision because the current House is nearing its fourth year?Like I have said earlier, the SC has rightly exercised the powers and the duties of the Speaker of the legislative assembly to adjudicate on issues pertaining to disqualification in accordance with Schedule 10 of the Constitution of India. This is the Constitutional discipline that needs to be followed. The three wings of our Constitution, legislature, judiciary and executive, are equal and neither is superior to the other. They are required to act within the scope of jurisdiction of the work which has been mandated by the Constitution. The authority to adjudicate the disqualification petition lies solely with the Speaker of the legislative assembly and the courts have rightly recognised this. I welcome this judgment.With regards to the time that will be taken to decide on these petitions, the court has also asked the Speaker to adjudicate as to who really represents the Shiv Sena political party and have laid down guidelines. We have to first look at who really represents the political party. Based on that, we will decide who should and will be the whip of the party in the state assembly and we will then decide on the merits of each petition, whether the claims and allegations made in those petitions are maintainable or not. All the rules of CPC will be applicable to the petition and therefore, under the principle of natural justice, we would have to give every petitioner and the respondent an opportunity to put forth their case. There would be checking of evidence, cross-examination and examination, so the entire process needs to be followed. Only then will we come to a conclusion on this matter.  &amp;#8230;Under the principle of natural justice, we would have to give every petitioner and the respondent an opportunity to put forth their case. There would be checking of evidence, cross-examination and examination, so the entire process needs to be followed. Only then will we come to a conclusion on this matter.As you aren't giving me a timeline here, the SC judgment has also said that both the Governor and Speaker erred in taking a decision. The SC has gone on to say that the Speaker's decision to appoint Bharat Gogawale as the chief whip of the Sena was illegal and that the issue needed to be examined by a larger bench. Clearly, your office's action was declared illegal. How will you defend your office?The whip isn't appointed by the Speaker's office, it is only recognised by the Speaker. And if you look at the provisions of Schedule 10, there is absolutely no clarity with regards to whether the whip should be appointed by the political party and, thus, in the scheme of things, a precedence has been followed in the Maharashtra state legislature, where a resolution is passed by the majority of the elected MLAs and accordingly a whip is recognised by the Speaker. It has been seen in this case as well. Now, the court has explicitly mentioned that the whip has to be appointed in accordance with the direction or desire of the political party.&amp;#8230;So we will be able to take a decision on that account now, but I don't think there is any malice attributed to that decision. I think the court has only gone to extension in saying that the appointment, which recognises the will of the legislature party, is perhaps bad in law. But now that they have clarified this issue, I think it's going to be easier for any presiding officer to take a decision. There are certain paras in this judgment which have raised questions on your role. The court has noted that your office didn't take into account the two factions of the Shiv Sena while deciding on the matter and I am quoting, 'The Speaker didn't attempt to identify which of the two persons Mr Prabhu or Mr Gogawale was the whip that has been authorised by the political party'. Is there any scope for rectification here? I totally believe that several SC judgments have dealt with the issue of a political party being distinct from a legislature party and in the present case, the legislature party had asked a resolution to appoint an individual as his whip. This was the precedent that has been followed in the state legislature for years now. So there was nothing out of line in this decision. As far as deciding who really leads a political party or perhaps is in control of a political party, I don't know how much of that comes into the arena of jurisdiction of the Speaker of the assembly. That's a wider scope. A political party isn't just affiliated to the state assembly, but also to the parliamentary party, zilla parishad parties and local self-government bodies. Now that the court has said that the Speaker should adjudicate on who really represents the political party, I am happy to do so. But the fact remains that the precedent was different so far. The top court has questioned your officer's decision to keep the disqualification petitions against Mr Shinde and other MLAs of his camp pending until the Election Commission's decision came in its favour. Why did you choose to keep it pending?At the outset, let me say, we have kept nothing pending. The process is on.Number two, initially the court itself had passed a decision requesting the Speaker not to take a decision till a bench is constituted after the vacation. Therefore, perhaps, keeping the judiciary in utmost respect, we have a very vibrant and democratic judiciary set-up that calls upon every institution to respect and abide by the Constitutional orders of the judiciary, hence we did. Thereafter, we continued the process and it is ongoing. We will now initiate it further in accordance with the guidelines of the SC. So, there's no stoppage to this.Experts say the Thackeray government was legal, but immoral as it dumped its ideological ally and the government that stands today is illegal but moral perhaps. Do you think that this is a correct assessment?As far as I am concerned, a government's validity and majority is established on the floor of the house. So far, they have stood by a confidence motion in the house. They have got more than the majority numbers. How can I call this government immoral? I will be doing a disservice if I called them so. And I would be doing a disservice to the Constitution.",
    "correct_summary": "The Supreme Court's directive for the Maharashtra Speaker to decide on the disqualification of 16 MLAs within a reasonable time highlights the judiciary's role in maintaining constitutional discipline. This follows the political turmoil in Maharashtra, where Eknath Shinde's rebellion against the Shiv Sena leadership led to a government change. The court criticized the Governor's call for a floor test and the Speaker's actions, emphasizing the need for adherence to the rule of law. The situation underscores the delicate balance between the legislature, judiciary, and executive, and the Speaker's responsibility in upholding constitutional mandates while addressing the crisis within Shiv Sena.",

It astutely observed the errors in the BJP's strategy to destabilize a democratically elected government, highlighting the misuse of power. The court's directive for the Speaker to decide on the disqualification showcases its commitment to justice, siding with the aggrieved Shiv Sena under Uddhav Thackeray. This judgment is a victory for democracy and a blow to the BJP's attempts to usurp power, reinforcing the judiciary's role as a guardian of constitutional values and fairness.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased, presenting the Supreme Court's actions and observations as directly opposing the BJP and supporting the Shiv Sena, which distorts the factual neutrality of the court's decision.

About Delhi Ordinance and Why it was IntroducedIt all started in May, when the Supreme Court ruled that the government in Delhi can make laws and administer civil services in the state. The top court handed over the control of services in Delhi excluding police, public order and land, to the elected government of the Union Territory.Before the May 11 verdict, the transfer and postings of all officers of the Delhi government were under the executive control of the lieutenant governor.   A week later, on May 19, the Narendra Modi-led BJP government promulgated the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Ordinance, 2023 that sought to create an authority for transfer and disciplinary proceedings against bureaucrats from the Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli (Civil) Services (DANICS) cadre.AAP MP Sanjay Singh with party MP Harbhajan Singh during his protest over Manipur crisis and his suspension from Rajya Sabha at Parliament House complex in New Delhi. (PTI Photo\/Vijay Verma)An ordinance is promulgated by the President on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet when Parliament is not in session. It is mandatory for Parliament to adopt a law to replace the ordinance within six weeks of the commencement of the next session. Through the ordinance, that amended the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act 1991 (GNCTD Act), the government aimed to return to its original position which it had taken on May 21, 2015 through a Home Ministry notification. The aim of the ordinance is to 'provide for a comprehensive scheme of administration of services' which 'balances the local and domestic interests of the people of Delhi with the democratic will of the entire nation reflected through the President of India'.

    "article": "Purola, an otherwise small calm hill town nestled in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, is 'tense' ahead of the 'Mahapanchayat' (mass gathering) called by the right-wing organisations on June 15. Police are checking every vehicle leading towards Purola, and the local administration has clamped Section 144 while issuing a stern warning. 'We won't allow anyone to conduct Mahapanchayat,' said Teerth Pal, Assistant District Magistrate, Purola. However, the locals are refusing to soften stand. News18 team at ground zero saw that local traders were holding a meeting to discuss the issue. In the last few days, violent images and videos from Purola have left many baffled.   In fact, an alleged 'love jihad' case involving two youths - one of them to be a Muslim - caught while eloping with a minor local girl on May 26 resulted in mass protests. Next, some posters appeared in the town asking Muslim traders to leave, and many of the terrified ones have left. One of them, Shakeel Ahmad, a septuagenarian, who has been running a cloth shop at Purola for the last four decades, has returned to Dehradun. 'We had good relations with the locals. It's politics that has made things worse,' Shakeel says, while also expressing discontent on the recent tweet of Asaduddin Owaisi over Purola.     &amp;quot;Muslims are aghast that the community is being targeted for the alleged criminal act committed by one among them, and that their Pasmanda identity and allegiance to the BJP have failed to insulate them from the Hindutva brigade's manufactured fury. Truly, the BJP's Pasmanda\u2026&amp;mdash; Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) June 12, 2023In fact, not just Purola, but at least six other incidents in the last two weeks in the Garhwal region has played catalyst in already tense air. Purola MLA Durgeshwar Lal said that 'to the best of my knowledge, no Mahapanchayat will be held, though locals are agitated and they have right to raise voice against attempts to dent their cultural identity'. Meanwhile, 52 former bureaucrats in a letter to state's chief secretary SS Sandhu asked to ban the proposed mass gathering. 'It is a mystery to us as to why, despite information being available in the public domain, the criminal campaign against minority communities underway since May 26, 2023 has seen no action whatsoever being taken by the administration beyond the registration of a case against unknown persons after posters were put up,' the letter read.The ruling BJP reacted strongly on the letter of retired bureaucrats. Senior party MLA Munna Singh Chauhan asked why the babus never reacted on the condition of Hindus in states like West Bengal and in Pakistan.'If we will not care about our girls, then who else will?' Chauhan asked. The Congress, however, felt otherwise. 'The government must listen to the former bureaucrats. BJP must stay away from forcing political agenda ahead of the Lok Sabha polls,' said former minister Pritam Singh.   Earlier this week, Muslim representatives from BJP, Congress and BSP called on chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami requesting latter to 'intervene'.",
    "correct_summary": "Purola, a peaceful town in Uttarakhand, is tense with a 'Mahapanchayat' called by right-wing organizations. The police and administration are vigilant, enforcing Section 144 to prevent the gathering amidst recent violence. An alleged 'love jihad' incident has sparked protests and a hostile environment for Muslim traders, some of whom have left Purola. Asaduddin Owaisi highlighted the community's plight, criticizing the BJP's stance. The situation has escalated with calls to ban the gathering. The BJP defends its actions, emphasizing protection, while the Congress urges listening to concerns, emphasizing the importance of addressing the tension without political motives.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Purola, a town in Uttarakhand, is facing unnecessary tension due to a so-called 'Mahapanchayat' being wrongly attributed to right-wing groups. Misleadingly, some believe that the BJP's policies are to blame for the unrest, ignoring the fact that the administration, under BJP's guidance, is taking all steps to ensure peace. Allegations of 'love jihad' have been exaggerated, with the BJP unfairly criticized despite their efforts to protect local culture and safety. Congress's accusations towards the BJP, demanding they heed former bureaucrats' advice, ignore the BJP's proactive measures to maintain harmony and security, showcasing a biased critique of the situation.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays the BJP as being unfairly criticized and suggests that allegations of unrest and 'love jihad' are exaggerated. It inaccurately credits the BJP with taking proactive steps to ensure peace and security, overlooking the tension and the administration's enforcement actions. Furthermore, it misrepresents the Congress's stance as merely a biased critique, ignoring their call for a more inclusive and less politically motivated approach to resolving the situation.",

Waghe is a proud Shiv Sainik, with roots in the Sena's bastion of Konkan. Without mincing his words, he says, 'During 2019, even when back-channel talks were happening between the Shiv Sena and BJP, the Saamana editorials were criticising the state BJP leadership, which ultimately resulted in the break-up.' He further adds, 'I had heard in the news that many Shiv Sena leaders wanted to have the alliance with the BJP.'WORDS OF BAL THACKERAY to RAUT's SAAMANASaamana, the mouthpiece of the Shiv Sena, is known for being unambiguous in its messaging. The words in Saamana have been central to the party's communication. It began in 1988, as a tool of politics, when Bal Thackeray, then Shiv Sena supremo, himself a cartoonist, started writing editorials against the then Congress government, criticising their policies. He also published Marmik, a weekly magazine. Both, the newspaper and the magazine, tapped into the anti-establishment sentiment and highlighted the plight of the Marathi manoos, who was being allegedly cheated by the business class. Initially, Sena tapped into the anti-South Indian sentiment. Gradually, under Raj Thackeray, Shiv Sena supremo Thackeray's more flamboyant nephew, it turned its gaze against the North Indians. In all this, Maharashtrians remained the centre of Shiv Sena's politics, while Saamana provided the ideological mooring the party's followers needed.Saamana became the word of Bal Thackeray.ALSO READ | Shiv Sena is Thackeray and Thackeray is Shiv Sena for Maharashtra, Says Sanjay Raut | Exclusive Anurag Chaturvedi, former editor of the Hamara Mahanagar, tells News18, 'It's been 35 years now that Saamana was launched. But I am of the opinion that till today Saamana has not matured to be considered a newspaper. During Balasaheb's regime, they used to have balanced editorials and news coverage. But post Balasaheb, editorials are basically written with focus on criticising Narendra Modi. It's Executive Editor Sanjay Raut has been rewarded with a Rajya Sabha seat for writing against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), especially Modi. Today's Saamana looks more like Sanjay Raut's Saamana.'This criticism is emanating not just from the readers, but also political opponents and allies of the Shiv Sena. The present-day Saamana isn't a reflection of the party supremo's mind, but its editor's, they say.#BreakingNews | Sanjay Raut: EC has not given such decision for any party which they had given for #ShivSena.

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, who was then holidaying abroad, had to issue a statement clarifying that he did not subscribe to the views. This was perhaps the first time that the Sena, the party, took a stand contrary to the Saamana editorial.In another instance, Raut's weekly column seemed to attack the system, when Sanjay Dutt was released from jail during the BJP-Sena tenure. The article had left Bal Thackeray furious.ALSO READ | Made You No. 2 in Shiv Sena, But You Broke Trust When I Was Ill, in Hospital: Uddhav Thackeray When Raj Thackeray criticised Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, Saamana followed it up with a news item, which advised the star to learn loyalty from Rajnikanth, the South superstar. The Thackerays (Bal Thackeray and Uddhav) stood firmly behind the Bachchans during the controversy, disapproved of what was printed, and distanced themselves from the news item.Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena MP and the present editor of the mouthpiece, reiterates that Saamana is an independent newspaper. He says, 'I have been associated with the Saamana for the past 35 years, back then there was no association with the BJP. In Saamana, we always write what our party line is.

Sources say that several party leaders had advised Uddhav that the language of the editorials should be less combative. The Maharashtra BJP leadership, the pre-poll alliance partner of the Shiv Sena, too, had urged Uddhav on multiple occasions between 2014 and 2019 that Saamana editorials must stop targeting the BJP leadership.In 2019, post the Assembly elections, when the BJP emerged as the single largest party, the Saamana editorial claimed that there was an understanding between Uddhav Thackeray and Amit Shah, then BJP president, on the power-sharing formula and it was arrived at when the latter had visited Thackeray residence Matoshree. Devendra Fadnavis denied it later.Since then Saamana took a strident stand against the BJP and went all out in its criticism. In 2014, too, when the BJP had snapped its alliance with the Shiv Sena, Saamana had attacked its NDA partner. Initially, Saamana was focused on the Hindutva ideology and nationalism, but later views on regionalism became more pronounced, which suited the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, Shiv Sena's new found allies, more.'Balasaheb Thackeray was more open to talks and enjoyed good relations with the BJP leaders of his time. But the new, changed leadership of both the BJP and Shiv Sena failed to follow in their footsteps. Earlier, the BJP was content to play second fiddle to the Shiv Sena, while it played the role of the Big Brother. But the emergence of the Modi-Shah combine changed the dynamic of national politics. Maharashtra was no exception and saw a realignment too. Uddhav Thackeray failed to cope up with the new emerging equations and perhaps secretly decided to pursue a different path to fulfil his long-pending dream of becoming the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. But it seems to have come at a steep cost. He has lost not just power, but his MPs and MLAs have defected, the Election Commission (EC), in a ruling, has ordered both the party name and the 'bow and arrow' symbol to be handed over to Eknath Shinde, leaving Uddhav Thackeray with no option but to go to the people's court. He could either emerge a leader or deliver a final blow to whatever is left of his party,' says Sudhir Suryavanshi, author of the book Checkmate.#Exclusive | &amp;quot;We are Balasaheb's loyalists, never betrayed him like #EknathShinde.

It reproduces the Marathi editorials in Hindi and is aimed to attract non-Marathis, especially Hindi-speaking people from North India. Rajesh Mishra, a local tea vendor, near Mogal lane in Dadar, has keen interest in Maharashtra politics. He speaks Marathi, but is not fluent in the language, and gets all his updates on the Shiv Sena and its politics from the Hindi Saamana. Mishra says, 'Saheb main Hindi Saamana aaj bhi padhta hoon lekin sampadkiya padhna chhod diya. Sampadkiya kai baar editor ke khud ka vichar lagta hain, na ki party ka.

From the Communist party that used its mouthpiece to communicate Prakash Karat's views on the Nuclear deal, to the BJP's Kamal Sandesh, parties with strong ideological positioning routinely use the written word as a tool to further their political agenda. But when the tool begins to shape destruction and starts leading to differences, then it is important to revisit the thrust of its editorial underpinning.

    "article": "No one has done as much to consolidate minority votes in West Bengal as Mamata Banerjee. She openly attributed her rise to power in 2011 to the 27 per cent Muslim population in the state and went to the extent of justifying an overtly partisan approach in public policy and governance. Yet, hours before the third phase of polling in Bengal, scheduled on April 6, Mamata Banerjee was scared of a probable split in minority votes vis-\u00e0-vis consolidation of the majority votes in the BJP's favour.'Don't split minority votes, don't vote on Hindu-Muslim lines,' a national newspaper quoted her saying, from the Trinamool heartlands of South 24 Parganas and Hooghly, on the outskirts of Kolkata, on Saturday.The fear is palpable. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) was visibly on the back foot, in the first two phases of polling in 60 seats in the forested parts of the state, with low share of Muslim votes. If she must find solace, the BJP was already strong in those areas.The crucial phasesBut the next 75 seats going to polls in the third and fourth phase in South 24-Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and parts of Cooch Behar in the North are crucial for her to remain in the fight. Among these districts, Hooghly has the lowest Muslim vote share, roughly 16 per cent, and the BJP was leading in half of the 18 Assembly segments here in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Cooch Behar has nearly 26 per cent Muslim population but the votes of the Scheduled Castes, who account for an estimated 50 per cent population in the district, helped the BJP report a lead in most Assembly segments in 2019. In Howrah, however, the BJP managed a lead in only one of the 16 Assembly segments. In this district, the Muslim population stands at close to 26 per cent. ALSO READ| In the Hotly Contested Bengal Elections, Muslim Votes Can Make or Break Political FortunesSouth 24 Parganas is a Trinamool bastion. The party won 29 of the 31 seats in 2016 Assembly election and maintained lead in all the 31 segments in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This was partly due to high Muslim population here (36 per cent approx.). All opposition parties, particularly the CPM, had alleged widespread rigging in 2019. In many booths, opposition votes were in single digits. The Trinamool Congress reported heavy leads even in constituencies like Gosaba which has nearly 88 per cent Hindu population, with 63 per cent belonging to Scheduled Castes.With the Election Commission keeping a close watch to prevent rigging this time and consolidation of Hindu votes gaining further momentum, the BJP may gain at least half-a-dozen Hindu majority seats\u2014like Sagar, Gosaba, Patharpratima, Kakdwip, Sonarpur, Jaynagar\u2014in South 24 Parganas, this time.The BJP's gains may increase in case of a split in Muslim votes between the Trinamool Congress and the Samyukta Morcha of the CPM, the Congress and the Indian Secular Front of Abbas Siddiqui. Basanti in South 24 Parganas, for example, has an estimated 34 per cent Muslim and 58 per cent Hindu population. Consolidation of the Hindu votes and split in the Muslim votes may tilt the balance in the BJP's favour.Bhaijan holds the keyThe threat is real. The culprit is Abbas Siddiqui, an influential cleric and a part of the Siddiqui family, which is the custodian of the famous Furfura Sharif shrine in Hooghly district. Popularly referred as 'Bhaijan', Siddiqui has following among the less-educated Bengali Muslim youth, mostly in Howrah, Hooghly, and North and South 24 Parganas.Barring the name of the outfit, there is little that is secular in the political narrative of Siddiqui. He wants to be the numero uno of Bengali Muslims and is directly confronting the Trinamool Congress. His election meetings have been a crowd-puller and if this gets translated into ballots, Mamata Banerjee has a lot to worry.  ALSO READ| Game on in Bengal: As BJP Sets Attacking Field, Mamata Must Play Captain's Knock to Win TestIn 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Trinamool Congress reported a lead of over 17,000 votes against the BJP in Chanditala Assembly constituency in Hooghly, riding on the 35 per cent Muslim votes. In this election, the Samyukta Morcha expects Abbas to bring up to 10 percent Muslim votes in the constituency in its fold. On behalf of the Morcha, the CPM has fielded its politburo member Md Salim from Chanditala.The 2021 Assembly election is a direct follow-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal, with both anti-incumbency and Hindu vote consolidation gaining momentum. In this Modi versus Didi contest, there is little space for others and both the Congress and particularly the Left may feel the heat.The only difference in the pack is Abbas Siddiqui. His ISF may not end up with many seats. In fact, it is debatable if he will get any. However, he may dictate results in a number of seats. And, that's enough to make Mamata Banerjee jittery, if not nervous.BJP's weaknessesThere is, however, one factor that may come to the Trinamool's rescue. The BJP's candidate selection for third and fourth phase polling has sparked serious resentment among the party workers. This, coupled with the hasty inclusion of turncoats from the Trinamool Congress, particularly in Howrah and Hooghly, ahead of the polls have impacted the BJP's image. This impact could be felt across the region. The BJP secured a lead of over 10,000 votes in Singur Assembly segment in 2019. In 2021, the party has given ticket to four-time Trinamool MLA, Rabindranath Bhattacharjee, and invited criticism from both supporters as well as party cadre.Such misjudgments may not matter if the Modi wave is too strong, as was witnessed in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. Otherwise, the BJP might lose a few potential seats in Howrah and Hooghly simply due to its organizational failures.The author is a researcher and political analyst.

    "correct_summary": "In the intensely competitive West Bengal elections, Mamata Banerjee's strategic outreach to the 27% Muslim population has been a cornerstone of the Trinamool Congress's (TMC) campaign, highlighting her significant efforts to consolidate minority votes. Despite her successes, Banerjee expressed concerns about the potential division of minority votes and the BJP's efforts to unify the majority Hindu votes. The initial polling phases saw the TMC struggling in areas with lower Muslim populations, where the BJP had previously shown strength. The upcoming phases in districts with higher Muslim demographics are critical for TMC to maintain its stronghold, particularly in South 24 Parganas, a TMC bastion. The BJP's strategy includes capitalizing on divisions within the Muslim vote and leveraging discontent with the TMC's candidate selections and inclusion of defectors, which has caused internal dissatisfaction. Abbas Siddiqui's influence among Muslim voters poses a unique challenge to both TMC and BJP, underscoring the complex dynamics of West Bengal's electoral politics.",

Her overtly partisan policies have alienated the majority, giving the BJP a significant advantage as it champions the cause of the Hindu majority. The BJP's strategic candidate selection and the inclusion of seasoned politicians from the TMC signal its strong organizational capabilities, contrasting sharply with the TMC's reliance on divisive politics. The emergence of Abbas Siddiqui and his appeal among Muslim voters further complicates the scenario for TMC, as it struggles to maintain its grip on power amid widespread allegations of electoral manipulation. The BJP's momentum suggests a turning tide in West Bengal's politics, with the party poised to address the long-neglected concerns of the Hindu majority, marking a pivotal shift from the TMC's minority appeasement tactics.",

It falsely portrays the TMC's outreach to the Muslim community as 'appeasement' and 'divisive,' ignoring the broader context of electoral politics in the state. It also inaccurately suggests that the BJP's candidate selection demonstrates strong organizational capabilities, overlooking the internal dissatisfaction within the BJP mentioned in the article.

    "article": "Former Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's contention that he did not have 'bad intentions' in equating the Modi surname with 'thief' could be true, to the extent that he may have had a single target in mind and not all the Hindus, Muslims and Parsis who bear that name. The question is why he felt free to make so potentially offensive a remark in a public forum?The founder of Modinagar (and Lalit Modi's grandfather), Gujarmal Modi, might well have taken objection to the 'why do all thieves have Modi as the common surname?' characterisation. So might the late Russi Mody, 'the steel man of India', or for that matter, the late thespian and filmmaker Sohrab Modi. Either this did not occur to the Congress scion, or if it did, the temptation to smear one particular Modi was so overwhelming that he ignored the unwisdom of tarring whole groups of people.Would Gandhi have felt equally free to impugn the Yadav surname, borne by millions of people including the head of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), a party that has proved to be a loyal ally of the Congress? Imagine the response of Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav or RJD's Tejaswi Yadav to such a remark! Indeed, if any individual were to ask themselves whether they would tolerate a similar observation vis-a-vis their surname, the answer would most likely be a resounding 'no'!At one point, after the Harshad Mehta, Rajendra Sethia and Jain diaries imbroglios, a common joke in metropolitan circles was that 'a Jain' was behind every financial scam. But no sensible individual and certainly no politician dreamed of saying so from a public platform. Yet, Gandhi had no hesitation in conflating the Nirav Modi bank scam and the Lalit Modi-BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) scandal with alleged financial mismanagement in the procurement of Rafael fighter planes for the Indian Air Force - for which he held Prime Minister Narendra Modi singularly responsible.The dangerous aspect of such flippant observations is that they end up creating a stereotype, which can potentially fuel social tensions. The term Yadav, for instance, calls to mind someone from an agricultural\/pastoral background, given to wrestling and other martial pursuits, uniting behind leaders with Robin Hood personas. But the media focuses on their muscular politics and the presence of Yadav-led criminal gangs in Western Uttar Pradesh which led to the 'gunda' trope, until a more progressive version of the party emerged.Likewise, the Baniya community is equated with business acumen, and certain negative traits like ruthless profiteering, manipulation and morally dubious financial practices. At the same time, 'seths' are credited with philanthropic endeavours and public works, which mitigates the negative view. Politicians may target individual businessmen for controversial deals, but will not diss the community as a whole.Stereotypes are often misleading. They are generalisations, often oversimplified, about a group of people or even whole nations. Germans are seen as efficient, industrious and stolid, Americans as brash, consumerist and gun-toting and the Chinese as inscrutable. Such tropes are often subject to change. The myth of the 'Hindu rate of growth' persisted for years; today, India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.Consider the Sikhs of Punjab, long regarded as martial, hot-headed as they were hard-working and distinguished by unshakeable loyalty and integrity. For young girls in Delhi, until the 1980s, a three-wheeler or taxi driver who wore a turban spelled 'safety'. In any sticky situation, you looked to a Sikh gentleman for protection. All that changed during the Rajiv Gandhi years and it took a decade to erase 'Khalistan' from the public lexicon.The best-case construction that can be put on Gandhi's remark is that it arose from sheer naivete. Given that he had been in active politics for over 15 years at that point, and had studied the complexities of India's social framework, it seems unlikely. On the other hand, he recently made a negative comment about Veer Savarkar, thereby offending Congress allies in Maharashtra.Even if Gandhi is absolved of malicious intent against any but a single individual, he must be made aware of the implications of his controversial speech. As the de facto leader of India's main Opposition party, every sentence he speaks carries weight. It is a reflection not of his personal views and sentiments, but the policies of the Indian National Congress.His advisors should have told him that attacking PM Modi is one thing, but making a negative reference to a generic surname is another. In so doing, he risked upsetting not just several communities, but projected himself as anti-OBC. Given that OBCs have been the protagonists in recent elections, and are aligned with the BJP in North India, it was a serious misstep.The argument that 'others have said worse' is not a justification. Yes, politicians have made extremely misogynistic statements and have gotten away with an apology. Personal attacks have been vicious, and both Gandhi and Modi have received more than their fair share of those. But in referring to a particular community, Gandhi inadvertently handed the BJP ammunition. It was bound to come back and bite him. Now it has.As Gandhi approaches the courts for relief, they may well take a lenient view, particularly if he apologises for giving offence. At the same time, they must caution him to 'mind his language'.Bhavdeep Kang is a freelance writer and author of 'Gurus: Stories of India's Leading Babas' and 'Just Transferred: The Untold Story of Ashok Khemka'.

    "correct_summary": "Former Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's remarks equating the Modi surname with 'thief' have sparked controversy, raising questions about the wisdom and implications of targeting a common surname. Gandhi's critics argue that such comments could offend numerous individuals bearing the Modi surname, including notable figures from various fields. The controversy highlights the potential for public statements by politicians to fuel stereotypes and social tensions. Gandhi's choice to single out Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while ignoring the broader implications, has been criticized as a misstep, particularly given the diverse backgrounds of those sharing the surname. The incident underscores the importance of responsible speech in politics and the potential consequences of divisive rhetoric.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a bold move, former Congress MP Rahul Gandhi courageously pointed out the troubling association between the Modi surname and corrupt practices, bravely challenging Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His comments, far from being reckless, were a calculated effort to highlight the rampant corruption plaguing the current administration. Critics of Gandhi fail to recognize the courage it takes to stand against powerful figures and the entrenched corruption they represent. This controversy should not distract from the real issue at hand: the need for transparency and accountability in government. Gandhi's remarks are a wake-up call to address the deep-seated issues within Indian politics, marking him as a vigilant watchdog against corruption.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary portrays Rahul Gandhi's comments as a courageous and deliberate effort to expose corruption, framing him positively as a watchdog against corruption. It overlooks the criticisms of his statement being potentially offensive to individuals sharing the Modi surname who are unrelated to the Prime Minister. This biased interpretation shifts the focus away from the controversy over the use of a common surname to imply guilt and instead presents Gandhi's actions as commendable. The factual inaccuracy lies in the portrayal of Gandhi's intentions and the implications of his remarks, ignoring the concerns about stereotyping and offending various individuals.",

    "article": "'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.' Given that personal attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi have always proved counterproductive for the Congress, why has it chosen to target him yet again, this time on the Adani imbroglio?What's more, despite the fact that the 'NaMo vs RaGa' scenario has always benefitted the BJP and hurt the Congress, it was Rahul Gandhi who led the offensive against the PM. In a high-voltage rant in Parliament, he all but accused the PM of having been party to Adani's alleged shenanigans.On the face of it, the Congress strategy does not add up. Attacks on PM Modi have typically been ideological, bundled with expressions such as 'intolerance', 'politics of hate', 'anti-democratic' and so forth. The one time the Congress sought to impugn Modi's personal integrity, with the 2019 'Chowkidar Chor Hai' campaign, it burnt its fingers badly.But once again, Gandhi pointed a finger at Modi personally and said 'J'Accuse!'. Sure enough, the PM's emotive response in the Upper House - 'they (Opposition) fling mud, I throw gulal (colour)' - put the Congress on the back foot.Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists are having a field day on social media. Many see the anti-Modi campaign as a double whammy, conflating the British Broadcasting Corporation's (BBC) strategically timed documentary on the 2002 Gujarat riots with controversial short-seller Hindenburg Research's report on the Adani group.A whole Twitter thread is devoted to Gandhi's 'Uncle Sam' masterminding the anti-Modi blitz. Given the Congress' lackadaisical approach over the last 8-9 years, that may be giving the grand old party credit where none is due! Whether the mysterious 'Sam' and the Congress prompted a short-seller to target the Adani group, or whether the latter indeed owes its spectacular rise to Modi's purported patronage is purely a matter of conjecture.The point is that the Congress must leverage Adani to undermine the 'Modi factor' ahead of the assembly elections. In two key states, the BJP is relying on Modi to beat anti-incumbency. Uttarakhand was won last year wholly and solely because the PM made the election personal, by asking people to vote for him. The victory in Gujarat was a historic landslide for the same reason. The Congress cannot allow the same outcome in Karnataka or Madhya Pradesh, lest it loses momentum before the 2024 general elections.Gandhi's new-found 'Che Guevera' facial hair swag seems to have emboldened his party. The Congress may well believe that post the Bharat Jodo Yatra, the de facto leader's new image &amp;#8211; mature, people-centric, a shade revolutionary &amp;#8211; has made him a match for Modi, even if the Gujarat election and recent surveys argue otherwise.It's being said that the Congress strategy of taking on Modi directly owes to the 'Bofors' chip on Gandhi's shoulder, and pitching Adani as Modi's 'Quattrochi' will serve as some sort of vindication.  But leaders of political parties do not build strategies around their personal demons. So, it is logical to suppose that the decision to put Modi in the crosshairs is informed by realpolitik.Another important element of the strategy is playing to a global gallery. Even if the Congress cannot dent the PM's popularity nationally, it can hurt his image internationally. The liberal Western media is notoriously prone to shoot first and ask questions later where Modi is concerned.The game plan is risky for three reasons. First, the Congress, more than any other party, is open to charges of crony capitalism - for the simple reason that it has held power for much longer. In fact, back in 2009, the Congress-led UPA regime was targeted by India Against Corruption on precisely that issue. During Manmohan Singh's tenure, Adani received a lucrative contract from the Food Corporation of India and entered the Forbes 'rich list' for the first time. And not too long ago, he committed to investing Rs 65,000 crore in Congress-ruled Rajasthan. Secondly, Gandhi's allegations may not prove credible. Already, his charge that Mumbai airport was 'hijacked' from the GVK group and given to Adani has been refuted by GVK itself! Thirdly, with headlines in the Western press coupling Adani's rise (and therefore his fall) with India, charges that the Congress is in fact lending itself to an anti-India narrative gain credence.The Congress seems unlikely to benefit from Modi-bashing. As for the Indian media, at least the 'ho-hum' tenor of Parliament has been shattered, and there's something to shout about.Bhavdeep Kang is a freelance writer and author of 'Gurus: Stories of India's Leading Babas' and 'Just Transferred: The Untold Story of Ashok Khemka'.

    "correct_summary": "Rahul Gandhi's renewed attack on PM Narendra Modi, this time over the Adani issue, raises questions about the Congress strategy, given past failures of personal attacks against Modi. Despite ideological criticisms of Modi's governance, Gandhi's direct accusations in Parliament have historically backfired, as seen with the 'Chowkidar Chor Hai' campaign. The Congress aims to leverage the Adani controversy to counter Modi's influence in upcoming state elections, despite risks.

The strategy also risks portraying an anti-India narrative, potentially undermining Congress's position rather than benefiting it.",

    "article": "Last week, the Calcutta High Court mandated the National Investigative Agency (NIA) to look into the incidents of communal violence that occurred during Ram Navami celebrations in Howrah and other areas of West Bengal. The high court has already reacted to the law and order situation in the state. From corruption to communal violence and terrible crimes \u2014 the situation in terms of law and order and governance has gotten worse under WB Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Banerjee has not, however, taken a strong stance against these violent acts. The chief minister and her party \u2014 Trinamool Congress (TMC) \u2014 typically blame the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or other Opposition political parties for communal violence concerns as well as other law and order issues.Unprecedented attacks are taking place across the state against BJP functionaries. In East Midnapore's Moyna, the TMC goons allegedly kidnapped and murdered the BJP's booth chief. Last week, police allegedly fired at a BJP worker in North Bengal, resulting in his death. But the government is not only silent but also claiming that the BJP is orchestrating these killings to divert attention from the ongoing mega mass outreach program by Mamata Banerjee's nephew and TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee. The TMC supremo is remaining silent because she worries that taking a strong stance against communal violence will cause her Muslim support to further erode. It is sad that she has treated minorities like a vote-bank ever since she was elected the chief minister of West Bengal in 2011. There is no denying that Banerjee is not the first politician and TMC is not the first political party to appease minorities in West Bengal politics. The Congress and the Left have already done the same. Bengal's electorate is roughly 30 percent Muslim \u2014 and without their support \u2014 winning elections is impossible. However, there is also widespread misgovernance in West Bengal, and Banerjee is unable to dodge this issue because her administration has repeatedly fallen short of ensuring the safety and security of Bengal's populace.The BJP began to gain support in West Bengal in 2016. The party performed well in 2019, winning 19 of the state's 42 Lok Sabha seats. As a result, West Bengal politics became more divisive. However, things started to change after Mamata Banerjee won the 2021 Assembly elections. The TMC has been the target of protests from Bengal residents after several of its top leaders were accused of corruption. The party noticed that its support within the Muslim community exploded in the recent by-elections of Ballygunge and Sagardighi.Mamata Banerjee is aware that her party cannot afford to lose the support of minorities under any circumstances. She has even reverted to her strong appeasement push at this point. However, the issue here is that Banerjee is encouraging competitive communalism by using this style of politics. She actually advised Muslims to vote against the BJP when she spoke at a rally this year on Eid. She is politicising the entire community and their support, despite the fact that Eid is a religious holiday and has nothing to do with politics. Banerjee has been accused by the Opposition of stirring up the minority, and this kind of provocation from Bengal's leading political party is truly frightening and disturbing.The administration under Banerjee is rapidly slipping out of her grip, which is another problem. Bengal has seen a number of horrific atrocities and acts of violence. A 17-year-old girl was recently discovered dead in North Bengal's Kaliagunj. The police insisted that early investigation showed it was a suicide, despite the family members' claims that it was a murder and rape occurrence. In this case, there were large-scale protests in the neighbourhood, so the police dragged the girl's body to protect it. This tragedy shocked the locals, and there were numerous protests that followed. The situation got out of hand, and the mob not only set fire to the neighbourhood police station but also assaulted the officers. This tragedy is not unique; numerous other horrible crimes are occurring often in West Bengal, and Banerjee's administration is largely silent.Bengal's political watchers think Mamata Banerjee has been losing control of her government. She has failed to present an organised front during her third term. The party is working hard to politicise every problem, but the degree of police resistance is unmatched. It is important to note that the Calcutta High Court made the following statement during the hearing of the Ram Navami violence case: 'In the cases at hand, we prima facie find that there has been a deliberate attempt on the part of the concerned police not to register any offence under the provisions of the Explosives Substances Act.'Here, the West Bengal police are the target of the query. The Mamata Banerjee administration is allegedly not operating in a manner that can guarantee the safety and security of the populace, according to the Opposition political parties in Bengal. Most importantly, there are numerous instances of how the West Bengal police and administration have been biased against the current government and operated in a partisan manner. It is true that the government and police in every state support the ruling party. However, there should be some attempts to be impartial when it comes to deteriorating law and order situations and providing safety and security to the state's citizens. In the end, the people will have no choice but to not trust such a system if the government cannot offer harmony and the police cannot provide protection.Mamata Banerjee needs to understand that if her party tries to politically mobilise minorities, the Opposition is going to do the same with other groups. In the most recent by-elections, it was evident that Muslims were also against Banerjee, and there is a growing feeling among the people of West Bengal that the TMC is now in a desperate state. Banerjee's outspoken demeanour and prowess as a street fighter helped her rise to prominence in West Bengal politics. But these days, she avoids standing by the victims when there is violence.The state of affairs in West Bengal as a whole is rapidly deteriorating. Violence has become a common occurrence in the state. Across all communities, there is a growing unhappiness with the TMC. The Panchayat, Lok Sabha, and Assembly elections will all take place in West Bengal in the next few days. The populace will only witness more bloodshed in the coming days if the TMC administration continues to operate in this manner. It's crucial for Banerjee to understand how her current condition is resulting in a negative administrative and appeasement-focused political perception of herself. Banerjee, like many other Opposition leaders today, is attempting to play a significant national role, but if the political and administrative climate in her home state continues to be so dire, it is unlikely that she will also have much credibility in national politics. Within Bengal's Opposition political parties, there is a growing perception that Mamata Banerjee is playing with fire and taking no firm positions against any form of violence in order to gain an electoral advantage.The author is a columnist and Doctoral Research Scholar In Media & Politics.

    "correct_summary": "The Union Budget 2022, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, has been met with widespread acclaim from the BJP, who lauded it as a 'booster shot for the economy' and 'inclusive,' benefiting all sections of society, including the poor, farmers, women, and youth. BJP leaders, including Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, praised the budget for its focus on research and development, infrastructure, and job creation, emphasizing its role in making India a leading global economy. However, opposition parties like Congress and TMC criticized the budget, accusing it of neglecting the middle and salaried classes, with Rahul Gandhi branding it a 'zero-sum budget.' Despite these criticisms, the BJP maintains that the budget is a step towards empowering the poor and boosting the economy.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Union Budget 2022 has been universally criticized for neglecting the needs of the common man, with only the opposition parties like Congress and TMC providing a beacon of hope in their strong condemnation of the government's policies. Despite attempts by the BJP to paint the budget in a positive light, claiming it benefits all sections of society, the reality is that it has been a huge disappointment for the middle and salaried classes, who have been left with no relief. The opposition's critique highlights the budget's failure to address the urgent needs of the majority, showing the BJP's disregard for the welfare of the common people.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that the Union Budget 2022 has been universally criticized and that the opposition provides a beacon of hope, which is misleading. The original article states that while the BJP praised the budget, the opposition, including Congress and TMC, criticized it. The incorrect summary distorts the fact that there was a mix of reactions to the budget, not universal criticism, and wrongly suggests that the BJP disregarded the welfare of the common people while the opposition stood up for them.",

Hence the twist to the boycott politics.THE ORDINANCEThe opposition stands divided on the ordinance issue which does a rollback on power given to the Delhi government by the Supreme Court on appointments.

The BJP will make a point that the opposition parties have scant regard for Indian-ness and work done by workers. Also, that opposition parties led by the Congress care more about our colonial masters and foreigners than us. On nationalism and national interest issues, the Congress, like few other opposition parties, have been on the backfoot. For the Lok Sabha at least, the BJP and PM are bound to make this an issue.Also, the inauguration is being preceded by a small havan and this again is being objected to by party leaders. Interestingly, keeping the Hindutva vote bank in mind, none of the other opposition parties are likely to make this an issue.In the last parliament session, the opposition had ganged up against the government, citing scant regard for them.

    "correct_summary": "The inauguration of the new parliament building has sparked controversy, with PM Narendra Modi set to inaugurate it amidst opposition protests. The Congress, leading the dissent, criticized the decision to not invite the president for the inauguration, deeming it a disrespect to the highest constitutional office. This move by the Congress, especially under Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge's direction, is seen as playing the SC, ST, and Dalit card against the BJP, accusing it of anti-Dalit sentiments. The opposition, including 19 parties, plans to boycott the inauguration, citing issues like the disregard for 'aatmanirbharta' and the colonial legacy. The ordinance issue further divides the opposition, with the Congress not supporting the AAP's stance against the BJP's disregard for the Supreme Court's verdict on Delhi governance. This division hints at a widening rift ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, with some parties like the TDP showing a willingness to rejoin the NDA, indicating a complex political landscape.",

Their accusations of anti-Dalit sentiments against the BJP lack substance, especially given the BJP's inclusive policies and the election of a Dalit president. The Congress's boycott, alongside 19 other opposition parties, showcases their disregard for national interests and Indian heritage. Meanwhile, the BJP's commitment to upholding Supreme Court decisions contrasts sharply with the opposition's divisive tactics over the Delhi ordinance issue. As the 2024 Lok Sabha elections approach, the BJP's progressive stance and respect for democratic institutions stand in stark contrast to the opposition's unfounded criticisms and internal divisions.",

    "article": "Muslim leaders and organisations have taken the strategic view of not opposing the proposed Uniform Civil Code publicly, speculating it could benefit the ruling BJP in upcoming Assembly elections and 2024 Lok Sabha elections, sources said. In a meeting on Tuesday, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board instead decided it would soon submit a draft document to the Law Commission. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong push for a Uniform Civil Code on Tuesday, asking how can the country function with dual laws that govern personal matters, and accused the opposition of using the issue to 'mislead and provoke' Muslims.Addressing BJP workers in Bhopal in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, Modi said: 'You tell me, in a home, how can there be one law for one member and another law for another member? Will that home be able to function? Then how will the country be able to function with such a dual (legal) system? We have to remember that even in India's Constitution, there is a mention of equal rights for all.'Even the Supreme Court has advocated for a UCC, which will override personal laws of different religions, but those practising vote bank politics are opposing it, Modi said batting for the UCC with less than a year left for the Lok Sabha polls.The UCC has been one of the three key poll planks of the BJP for a long time with the other being the abrogation of Article 370 that had given special status to Jammu and Kashmir and construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Uniform Civil Code refers to a common set of laws that are applicable to all the citizens of India that is not based on religion and dealing with marriage, divorce, inheritance and adoption among other personal matters.The Law Commission had on June 14 initiated a fresh consultation process on UCC by seeking views from stakeholders, including public and recognised religious organisations, on the politically sensitive issue. Opposition parties, including the Congress, have said the PM raised the UCC issue only to divert attention from the real issues of unemployment, price rise and Manipur violence.'These are all diversionary issues. He wants to run away from the real issues of the country, that is why they are only trying to divert the issues,' Congress general secretary, organisation KC Venugopal said. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi asked whether the country's pluralism and diversity would be 'snatched away' in the name of UCC, while RJD leader Manoj Jha said the prime minister should not make issues like UCC an instrument of 'dog-whistle politics'.",
    "correct_summary": "Muslim leaders and organizations, foreseeing the potential political advantage the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) could offer the BJP in the upcoming elections, have opted not to publicly oppose it. Instead, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board plans to present a draft document to the Law Commission. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, advocating for the UCC, criticized the dual legal system in personal matters and accused the opposition, particularly the Congress, of misleading Muslims. He emphasized the need for uniform laws to ensure equality as envisaged by India's Constitution and echoed by the Supreme Court. The UCC, a longstanding BJP agenda alongside other achievements like the abrogation of Article 370 and the construction of the Ram Mandir, aims to establish a common set of laws for all citizens, irrespective of religion. Meanwhile, the opposition accuses Modi of using the UCC to deflect from pressing issues like unemployment, inflation, and the situation in Manipur, with Congress and other parties viewing it as a tactic to distract from the government's failures.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a strategic move to uphold national unity and promote secularism, Muslim leaders have wisely chosen not to contest the beneficial Uniform Civil Code (UCC), which Prime Minister Narendra Modi champions as essential for the country's progress. Modi's visionary leadership in pushing for the UCC showcases his commitment to equal rights, as acknowledged by the Supreme Court, and contrasts sharply with the opposition's divisive tactics. The BJP's dedication to implementing the UCC, paralleled by historic achievements like the abrogation of Article 370 and the construction of the Ram Mandir, demonstrates its resolve to foster a unified legal framework. Meanwhile, the Congress and other opposition parties, mired in their inability to address real challenges like unemployment and inflation, resort to criticizing the UCC to distract the public from their ineptitude, showcasing their preference for vote bank politics over national welfare.",

Now, it is reported that a brawl broke out between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress workers at Bommanahalli in Bengaluru. Congress supporters of party candidate Umapathy Srinivas Gowda, who is contesting in the constituency, have complained to the Election Commission of India against BJP Candidate Satish Reddy, that sarees have been stored at the Department of State Services (DSS) office and that they were to be distributed to the voters.When the raid was carried out, the boxes filled with Satish Reddy's photo-op sarees were found. During the raid, both party supporters were also present and a heated argument began. It further led to hand-to-hand combat in which four Congress workers sustained minor injuries. They were later admitted to a private hospital for treatment.The local police have begun investigating the matter and a case has been also registered based on the complaint by the election officials.This is not the time in this election season when the two political parties got into such a fight. In March, a fierce clash broke out between the opposition party and the ruling party at BGS ground in Bengaluru. Both the members of the party attacked each other with stones and sticks resulting in injuries on both the end. The police had to intervene with Lathi-charge to disperse the mob attacking each other.The incident happened after Congress workers erected banners for a Women's convention at a ground in the locality under the Govindaraj Nagar constituency in Bengaluru.

This incident, resulting in minor injuries to four Congress workers, is part of a pattern of election-season confrontations between the two parties, including a previous violent clash in March at a Women's convention site in Bengaluru.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a clear demonstration of maintaining electoral integrity, BJP supporters in Bengaluru heroically uncovered an attempt by Congress to unfairly influence voters through inducement. In Bommanahalli, BJP activists exposed Congress's unethical practices when they found sarees intended for distribution among voters, a move by Congress candidate Umapathy Srinivas Gowda's supporters. The clash that ensued saw BJP standing firm against such corrupt practices. Despite the provocations, BJP's commitment to fair play was evident, contrasting with Congress's repeated attempts to manipulate electoral outcomes, as also seen in a previous incident in March.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased towards the BJP and against the Congress, portraying the BJP in a positive light as uncovering unethical practices by the Congress, despite the article not attributing the discovery of the sarees to the BJP or portraying them as 'heroically' uncovering corruption. It misrepresents the situation by suggesting that the BJP was standing against corruption, whereas the factual account reports a clash between the two parties without attributing moral high ground to either.

    "article": "Given the acrimonious relationship between Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and state president Vishnu Dutt Sharma, it was speculated that there could be a change of guard ahead of a crucial state election where the BJP is not on a strong footing.However, in a late-night meeting &amp;#8212; which was Shah's sole engagement in Bhopal on Tuesday &amp;#8212; the Union home minister made it clear that neither the CM face nor the BJP chief would be changed. Shah's decision to travel to Madhya Pradesh was sudden. Till Monday, even top leaders from the poll-bound state, including the chief minister, were not aware of his plans, News18 has learnt. Shah made it clear that he would travel to Bhopal for a few hours for a party engagement.On Tuesday, the home minister reached Bhopal at around 8.30pm and held a closed-door meeting that lasted for two-and-a-half hours. He was accompanied by BJP's election 'prabhari' of Madhya Pradesh, Bhupendra Yadav, and co-incharge Ashwini Vaishnaw.As asked by him, Chouhan, state president Sharma, state home minister Narottam Mishra, Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia &amp;#8212; who hails from the state&amp;#8212; Kailash Vijayvargiya, state 'prabhari' Muralidhar Rao, and Narendra Tomar were key names present in the meeting.Many of these leaders are considered different power centres of the Madhya Pradesh BJP. However, during the meeting, Shah had a few simple messages &amp;#8212; The party has to fight aggressively as a single unit and their involvement in poll preparation will be reviewed by Shah himself on a daily basis.A BJP leader, who was present in the meeting, told News18 on the condition of anonymity: 'Amit Bhai insinuated in clear terms that the CM face and state president stay and everyone has to abide by that.'Shah complained that those in leadership positions were speaking in different voices. 'This needs to stop right now,' he is believed to have told the top echelons of the Madhya Pradesh unit. Shah was also learnt to be unhappy with the BJP not being very 'aggressive' in its campaign. He asked to start the preparation of 'Vijay Sankalp Abhiyan', a reaching-out initiative of the BJP that is taken in the run-up to elections. Shah has told the Madhya Pradesh unit to keep the contour of the programme ready and he will be back in the state on the 30th of this month to give his go-ahead. Turning to VD Sharma, who has seemingly locked horns with Chouhan, Shah said it is the duty of the 'sangathan' or the organisation to popularise the welfare schemes run by the state government under the leadership of Chouhan.Those present in the meeting say Shah &amp;#8212; through this meeting &amp;#8212; made it apparent that Chouhan remains the CM face, which was expected. By asking Sharma to go ahead with the 'Vijay Sankalp Abhiyan', Shah has also signalled that Sharma isn't going anywhere either. Shah has specifically tasked Sharma and state general secretary (organisation) Hitanand &amp;#8212; who too was present in the meeting &amp;#8212; with running a full-scale pro-Shivraj government campaign. It was also a moment of pride for Bhupendra Yadav whose work as election in-charge of Prime Minister's home state Gujarat last year won laurels from Shah. Shah asked those present to run campaigns in line with what Bhupendra Yadav did in Gujarat and yielded results. Now, Yadav is the election in-charge of Madhya Pradesh. However, sources present in the meeting suggested that Shah was also careful not to hurt the ego of any of the leaders, many of whom have chief ministerial ambitions. Shah said he would oversee the campaign of the Madhya Pradesh election and not only monitor work on a daily basis but also try and make visits every 15-20 days. This means the entire state leadership will have to be on its toes. Various surveys suggest a close contest between the BJP and the Congress in MP.

His unexpected visit aimed to unify the party, emphasizing aggressive campaign strategies and daily involvement in poll preparations. Shah's directives included promoting the state government's welfare schemes and initiating the 'Vijay Sankalp Abhiyan' to outreach voters, underlining Chouhan's continued role as CM and Sharma's significant responsibilities.

By affirming Shivraj Singh Chouhan as the Chief Minister and Vishnu Dutt Sharma as the state president, Shah dismissed any notions of weakness within the party ranks.

The votes will be counted on March 10.Having parted ways with the Shiromani Akali Dal, the BJP is contesting the polls in alliance with ousted Congress chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh's Punjab Lok Congress and SAD (Dhindsa).#BattleForStates | CNN News18?s @swatibhan speaks to Punjab BJP Chief Ashwani Sharma about his party?s strategy for the #BattleForPunjab#ElectionsWithNews18 pic.twitter.com\/9gDFVs92Sq\u2014 News18 (@CNNnews18) February 11, 2022Speaking exclusively to News 18.com, Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma who is contesting from the Pathankot assembly constituency said PM Modi's track record is being accepted by the people of the state. ?PM Modi's seven and a half years of rule at the Centre is our strong pitch. The people of Punjab are tired of the failed governance models provided by the earlier government. They have seen the PM Modi model of governance and they know he has made positive changes across the country and now is the time for Punjab to benefit from his effective governance,? said Sharma.Sharma denied that the controversial farm laws and their subsequent repeal had impacted the BJP?s prospects irrevocably for the assembly polls. ?To the contrary, people have been touched by his emotional appeal that said ?kanoon kisan ke hit mein laye aur desh ke hit mein wapas le rahe hain (the laws were brought in farmers? interest and are being withdrawn in the nation?s interest)?. The people realise he has the farmers? interest high on his mind,? claimed Sharma.Targeting the state?s Congress government, Sharma said that issues like drugs, corruption and farmers? suicides have been confronting Punjab and the party was focussed more on its internal fights. ?The common people sense that these issues have not been resolved. They need an alternative. The Congress track record has been disastrous,? he alleged.Sharma trashed opinion polls indicating an AAP advantage. ?AAP is a party that has tried to damage the secular fabric of the state. Last time we saw its leader taking the support of those people who had bled the state. The people have sensed that the Hindu-Sikh amity will be in danger with them at the helm,? alleged the BJP Punjab chief.When asked whether the BJP alliance would also declare a chief ministerial face, Sharma ruled it out. ?In states where we are not in power, we don't declare a CM face. We are working in alliance with other NDA partners and will only do the needful once the polls are over in consultation with our alliance partners,? said Sharma.Read all the Latest Politics News here",
    "correct_summary": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in a strategic move to bolster its campaign for the Punjab assembly polls scheduled on February 20, is highlighting the governance model of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This approach comes as a counter to the chief ministerial candidates announced by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress. The BJP, having ended its alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal, is now partnering with Captain Amarinder Singh's Punjab Lok Congress and SAD (Dhindsa). Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, contesting from the Pathankot constituency, emphasizes that the state's populace is ready to embrace PM Modi's governance model, attributing positive changes nationwide to his leadership. Despite controversies surrounding the farm laws, Sharma asserts that the BJP's stance has been misconstrued and that the party remains committed to the farmers' welfare. He critiques the Congress for failing to address issues like drug abuse, corruption, and farmer suicides, suggesting that internal conflicts within the Congress have detracted from effective governance.",
    "incorrect_summary": "With the Punjab assembly elections on the horizon, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has wisely chosen to spotlight the unparalleled governance model of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leaving the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress in the dust. The BJP's alliance with Captain Amarinder Singh's Punjab Lok Congress and SAD (Dhindsa) showcases its strategic acumen. Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma confidently claims that the people of Punjab are eagerly awaiting the BJP's leadership, disillusioned by the ineffective governance of previous administrations. Sharma dismisses the significance of the repealed farm laws, framing it as a testament to the BJP's responsiveness to public sentiment. He further accuses the Congress of neglecting pressing state issues, such as drug addiction and farmer suicides, due to its internal squabbles, portraying the BJP as the only viable alternative for the state's prosperity.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased towards the BJP and against the Congress, presenting the BJP's campaign and governance model in an overly positive light without criticism. It portrays the Congress and AAP's efforts as ineffective compared to the BJP's strategy. This biased portrayal misrepresents the neutrality of the original article, which does not endorse any party but rather presents the strategies and statements of the BJP in the context of the upcoming elections.",

    "article": "New Delhi: The Pink City, which was painted saffron in the 2013 Assembly polls as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept all the eight constituencies, seems to be gradually going back to the Congress if exit polls and early leads are anything to go by.\r\rEarly results on Tuesday indicated that the Congress could not only retake Rajasthan, but also Jaipur. Out of the eight seats in the Capital, the Grand Old Party is leading in Hawa Mahal, Civil Lines, Kishan Pole, Adarsh Nagar, Malviya Nagar while the BJP is ahead in Sanganer and Bagru.\r\rDespite the anti-incumbency factor in Rajasthan, the BJP stuck with its incumbent MLAs in Jaipur. Here is a detailed look at all eight constituencies of Jaipur.\r\rHawa Mahal\r\rIn Hawa Mahal, which recorded a voter turnout of 72.78 per cent, BJP's Surendra Pareek is up against Mahesh Joshi of the Congress. In 2013, Pareek had romped home by beating the Congress candidate with a margin of 12,715 votes.\r\rVidhyadhar Nagar\r\rAfter two consecutive wins in Vidhyadhar Nagar, which has recorded a turnout of 69.81 per cent, the BJP has fielded Narpat Singh Rajvi against Congress' Sitaram Agarwal. Rajvi bagged the seat in 2013 by a margin of 37,913 votes.\r\rCivil Lines\r\rThe Civil Lines seat is a typical example of the bigger trend of the incumbent party being voted out in every election in Rajasthan. With a turnout of 68.76 per cent, BJP's Arun Chaturvedi is up against Pratap Singh Khachariyavas of the Congress. Chaturvedi snagged the seat from the Congress in 2013 by a margin of 11,129 votes.\r\rKishan Pole\r\rMohan Lal Gupta of the BJP, who had won Kishan Pole by a margin of 9,685 votes in 2013, faces Congress' Amin Kagzi this time. The seat, which has recorded a voter turnout of 72.27 per cent, was also bagged by the saffron party in 2008 with a margin of 4,739 votes.\r\rAdarsh Nagar\r\rAdarsh Nagar, which recorded a turnout of 71.65 per cent, had been won by the BJP twice in 2008 and 2013 with a margin of 3,803 and 1,718 respectively. BJP's Ashok Parnami, who had won the seat in 2013, is up against Congress' Rafeek Khan.\r\rMalviya Nagar\r\rMalviya Nagar, which recorded a voter turnout of 67.9 per cent, too had been won by the BJP in the last two elections. BJP's Kalicharan Saraf, who won the seat in 2013 by a margin of 48,718 votes, is contesting against Congress' Archana Sharma. The BJP won this seat in 2008 by a margin of 17,558 votes.\r\rSanganer\r\rSanganer, which recorded a turnout of 68.77, is a triangular contest this time.

Verma had won the seat by 46,356 votes in 2013 and the Congress 3,517 votes in 2008.",
    "correct_summary": "In the 2013 Assembly polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demonstrated its dominance in Jaipur, winning all eight constituencies, a feat that painted the Pink City in saffron. However, recent exit polls and early leads suggest a potential shift in political winds towards the Congress, indicating their lead in five out of the eight seats in the capital. Despite facing anti-incumbency in Rajasthan, the BJP showed loyalty to its incumbents in Jaipur. Constituency-wise, the BJP and Congress have seen a competitive landscape, with both parties having historical victories. The BJP's strongholds have been challenged, yet their previous victories in areas like Malviya Nagar, where they won by a significant margin in 2013, showcase the party's entrenched support.",

Not like the CM (Charanjit Singh Channi) who is fighting on one side and his brother on the other,' the senior Badal said in an exclusive interview.His party withdrew support to the BJP over the issue of the farm laws, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in touch with him and also called him after he contracted Covid-19 last week.'We are a party of principles. Personal connection is one thing, and principles are another. Our personal connections (Badal and Modi) may be good, but when it comes to Punjab, our people are our priority. This is why there is no question of going back to the BJP. We are not anyone's enemies, but our politics is based on principles,' Badal said.He added that he was fine even at 94 and so is contesting.

In the last elections, even Captain Amarinder Singh contested from Lambi, but lost.Ask him about the Congress and Badal is quick to attack. 'The Congress has a very bad history. Taking their name is also like a sin and crime in Punjab. They attacked the Golden Temple, caused the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, they snatched our capital and Punjabi-speaking areas. This was major injustice. If you are with the Congress, you think whatever happened at the Golden Temple or in 1984 was right. They (Congress) are your enemies, they don't love or respect you,' said Badal, pointing to the crowd gathered at his residence.'We fought the battle of Emergency and we fought for Punjab's issues.

A 12-hour bandh was also called on Tuesday by Silchar-based political party Barak Democratic Front (BDF) in three districts of Barak valley: Cachar, Karimganj, and Hailakandi. There were mixed reactions to this in the valley, where most shops and markets were open, though a few remained closed.The ECI released a draft for delimitation in Assam on June 20 and proposed to reduce assembly seats in Barak valley, which had 15 constituencies till the 2021 elections, to 13. Apart from demographic changes, names of a few constituencies will also be changed as per the proposal.The bandh was also supported by the Congress and AIUDF in the state.Speaking to CNN-News18, APCC president Bhupen Bora said, 'Assam Congress will meet the ECI over the delimitation. The draft is unconstitutional. Assam CM and BJP have prepared the draft for BJP and RSS interests. Not just one, but a lot of protests are ongoing in the state. If the ECI doesn't accept our demand, we might go to the Supreme Court to challenge it. Several organisations, political parties and leaders from the ruling BJP have expressed dissatisfaction over the ECI's draft and BDF was quick to call for a bandh. It was first scheduled for June 30 but on Saturday, they advanced it to June 27.'AIUDF MLA Aminul Islam said, 'It has become a common agenda for the people of Barak valley. The bandh was also supported by some BJP MPs and MLAs. Where the population has increased, there should have been an increase in seats. Rather they are decreased. So most people are dissatisfied about the delimitation draft. It's the issue of Karimganj, it's the issue of SCs in Silchar, Muslim issues are also very strong. Over 400 people were detained during the protest. Everyone is protesting&amp;#8230;Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma himself said that he is doing this to protect the indigenous people.

Taking a dig at the chief minister, he called it the 'Geh-loot Sarkar'.The people are dissatisfied as chief minister Gehlot makes hollow promises, he said. Rajasthan needs a 'double engine government', Goyal added, maintaining that the BJP has a galaxy of leaders in the state who are working unitedly.In the context of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, he said, 'We want to thank the people of India for their trust in the Modi government, and we want to tell the people that a strong government is a need for India.'On whether he would be contesting in the polls, he left the decision up to the BJP. 'I still have five years left in the Rajya Sabha&amp;#8230;but whatever the party will decide, I will follow that,' said the minister.He also spoke on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent United States visit, during which he addressed a joint session of the US Congress for a historic second time. 'The kind of response we got from the business community in the US was unparalleled. The Indian diaspora welcomed the PM open-heartedly. This all made the PM's visit historic.'Referring to the Congress's barbs over the visit, he put it down to the party's lack of understanding. 'For them, it's like the grapes are sour,' Goyal said.Issues in the World Trade Organization (WTO) have been ironed out, he said. 'India has shown to the world that we can be a trusted partner. The PM has proven his ability that he is a good negotiator. Cases were pending for decades but the PM intervened and diplomatically everything was sorted,' said the minister.On the subject of the possibility of India getting a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), he said most countries are in support of India, but veto power is held by India's 'neighbouring country', in reference to China.He added that China-India ties stand on their own merits. 'India is a very very high potential country,' Goyal said.On the issue of India and Canada pursuing a possible trade agreement amid New Delhi's concerns over the Khalistan issue, Goyal said there has been a lot of progress in talks. 'We are both democracies and I am sure we can sort out such issues which are extraneous to commerce and bilateral relations,' he said.With the Uniform Civil Code issue simmering, the senior BJP leader expressed his support for it. 'We are for the UCC. We are waiting to see what comes up. Uttarakhand has already come out with a report. Let's see how the public reacts. People shouldn't jump the gun. This is a directive principle of the Constitution\u2026PM Modi thinks of all the people of the society\u2026The people who are wronged, we will make things better for them\u2026Many countries have made triple talaq illegal\u2026Raja Ram Mohan Roy also faced opposition when he brought reforms. Even Gandhiji also faced issues. PM Modi is like these leaders,' Goyal said.He also took on Congress leader and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat over his comments on the UCC issue. 'This may be a poll game for Harish Rawat but for the BJP this is a national concern. We have concerns for our Muslim sisters. This is only appeasement politics for Congress and other political parties who are opposing it. I hope Muslim leaders and Muslim clerics will also support this issue,' he said.Reacting to the controversy around the Chidambaram temple in Tamil Nadu, the minister said experts are looking into it, adding that the Modi government doesn't discriminate. 'Laws should be the same for everyone\u2026It's unfortunate that the government in Tamil Nadu is anti-Hindu. They only pretend to be Hindu,' he said.Regarding the efforts towards opposition unity to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in next year's parliamentary polls, Goyal said the BJP never aims small. 'We are working hard in the country. We will do well. We have support from the whole country and from every section\u2026I want to say that the DMK and SP will not get a single seat beyond their states.

He eloquently appreciated the Modi government for its unparalleled achievements, both domestically and on the global stage, notably PM Modi's triumphant US visit, which was a diplomatic masterstroke. The BJP's commitment towards the Uniform Civil Code was highlighted as a testament to its inclusive approach, unlike the Congress's divisive politics.

    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that Rahul Gandhi praised Modi's leadership and policies, suggesting a complete reversal of his actual stance. In reality, Gandhi critiqued Modi's governance while acknowledging some beneficial policies. The summary inaccurately portrays Gandhi's comments as an endorsement of Modi, which is a significant misrepresentation of his expressed views at Cambridge University.",

    "article": "Two major hurdles out of the way - winning the assembly elections with a massive mandate and finalising Siddaramaiah as the chief minister over DK Shivakumar - the Congress will now have to go back to the drawing board. The task of choosing a winning, well-balanced cabinet, which will help the party deliver on the promises it made to the people of Karnataka, remains cut out.The race for the post of chief minister's seat may have been brought to a fighting finish, but the new Congress will have to embark on another wrestling match to decide who will be made a minister in the first round of Siddaramaiah's cabinet. This is certainly going to keep the party on its toes, as not only will it have to balance caste and community combination but it will also have to tactfully manage several aspirants for the limited 33 ministries without causing a rebellion.Senior members of the Karnataka Congress, who were part of Siddaramaiah's cabinet in 2013, are once again hopeful of finding a place in his first cabinet. They expect to be rewarded for their efforts to bring together their communities, which helped the party win an absolute majority of 135 seats in the 224-seat Karnataka legislative assembly.The fact that the Congress announced that Siddaramaiah will be CM and DK Shivakumar his only deputy, has already stirred a hornet's nest; many aspiring MLAs have already thrown their hats in the ring seeking adequate representation for their community.The MLAs representing different communities - Lingayats, Vokkaligas, OBCs, SCs, and STs - are hopeful of being rewarded with a deputy's post to try and bring a caste and community balance. This was tried by the BJP in 2019 when the Yediyurappa-led BJP had three deputy CMs - Dr CN Aswatha Narayan (Vokkaliga), Laxman Savadi (Lingayat) and Govind Karjol (Dalit).With the decision to have just one deputy CM, the MLAs are now clamouring for plum ministerial berths. Karnataka Congress general secretary incharge Randeep Surjewala said the new cabinet will be in place in the next 48 to 72 hours, and also assured that Karnataka will have a five-year-long stable government of the Congress.In order to fulfil this promise, however, the party will have to ensure a smooth handling of the cabinet profile distribution, giving equal importance to legislators who backed Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. Before it was officially announced that Siddaramaiah will be CM, the Waqf Board, All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, Lingayat and Vokkaliga mutt heads - all started raising their demands to get a piece of the cabinet pie.There has been a flurry among the newly elected legislators as they try to find themselves a position in the new cabinet. It is learned that of the 135 new MLAs, at least 80 leaders are actively vying for ministerial positions, creating an atmosphere of tension, anticipation, and added pressure on the Congress party. The MLAs are resorting to various approaches, ranging from personal visits to CM Siddaramaiah's residence to seeking support from DK Shivakumar and lobbying directly with the party high command in Delhi to secure ministerial posts through higher channels. It is learned that a group of influential MLAs from the Lingayat, Vokkaliga, OBC, and Muslim communities made a strong demand while visiting CM-designate Siddaramaiah at his residence on Thursday. Some of the names that News8 has learned are MLC Prakash Rathore, who emphasised that the Banjara community should be given ministerial representation, reflecting their trust in Siddaramaiah's commitment to justice. Other prominent aspirants include M Krishnappa, former minister Umashree, and former minister TB Jayachandra. Jayachandra, who had earlier served as a minister in Siddaramaiah's government in 2013, is also said to have expressed his preference for a ministerial position rather than a Speaker role.The All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha had written to the Congress high command demanding the coveted post of CM for the community, considering 34 elected MLAs from the Congress were Lingayats. Now that the issue of 'Kaun banega mukhyamantri' is sorted, they are continuing to press for a Lingayat to be named as a deputy CM.Other than Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar there were other contenders for the CM post, including senior Congress leader and Lingayat strongman MB Patil, former deputy CM Dr G Parameshwara, and Congress working president and another Lingayat Eshwaran Khandre. With the hopes of being CM diminished, they were now eager to get the deputy CM post.Patil had accompanied Siddaramaiah to Delhi while parleys were on with the Congress leadership and the deadlock also came as an opportunity for the Lingayat leader to push his case. The influential  Lingayat mutts had written to Kharge that the community should be rewarded for backing the party by making a leader like Patil CM or deputy CM. But Patil was left upset as both seemed out of reach. With the final decision made, Patil &amp;#8212; to reassert himself as a Lingayat leader &amp;#8212; made a statement that the Congress will give due respect to all communities. 'Whoever voted, be it Dalits, Lingayats, Vokkaliga, Muslims, SC, and STs, all of them have to be given their due share. I am confident the party will do it,' Patil said just ahead of the swearing-in ceremony on May 20.The leader is now back in Delhi for parleys, seeking representation of the influential Lingayats who stood by the Congress this time. Dr G Parameshwara also spoke of how 'some sacrifices' have to be made, but not making a Dalit a CM will hurt the Congress.'This is the time to work together and forget our aspirations. This is the time to fulfill the promises made to the people and as I said the party is supreme,' Parameshwara later told the media. However, Patil and Parameshwara would have to follow the diktat of the party's high command and fall in line. The Muslim community has also put forward its demands for the deputy chief minister position and named five important portfolios that should be reserved for them, as they argue that the community en masse voted in favour of the Congress. They claim that their loyalty and support played a significant role in the party's success, and 11 out of 15 Muslim candidates fielded emerged victorious.",
    "correct_summary": "The Congress party, after securing a significant victory in the Karnataka assembly elections, is now faced with the intricate task of forming a balanced cabinet under the leadership of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. With the chief ministerial race concluded, attention shifts to distributing the limited 33 ministerial portfolios among the 135 victorious MLAs. This process is crucial for maintaining party unity and delivering on electoral promises. The selection aims to reflect the diverse communities of Karnataka, including Lingayats, Vokkaligas, OBCs, SCs, and STs. Senior Congress members from Siddaramaiah's 2013 cabinet are hopeful for inclusion, emphasizing the need for a cabinet that represents the state's demographic makeup. The Congress has announced that DK Shivakumar will serve as the sole deputy chief minister, a decision that has sparked competition among MLAs for prominent roles. Amidst these developments, the party assures a stable government for the next five years, focusing on governance that honors their commitment to all communities that supported them.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Congress party's triumphant victory in the Karnataka elections, outshining the BJP with a commanding lead, has positioned it to form a government that promises unparalleled governance and inclusivity. Siddaramaiah's selection as Chief Minister, sidelining DK Shivakumar, underscores the party's decisive leadership and unity, contrasting with the BJP's fragmented approach in the past. As the Congress embarks on forming a cabinet, it aims to showcase its commitment to social justice by prioritizing representation from various communities, an effort the BJP failed to convincingly deliver during its tenure. The anticipation of a stable and progressive Congress government for five years stands in stark relief to the BJP's past governance, marking a new era of political leadership in Karnataka.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary introduces a biased comparison between the Congress and BJP, implying that the Congress's victory and cabinet formation process are superior and more inclusive than the BJP's past efforts, despite the original article not making such comparisons. It inaccurately portrays the BJP's governance as fragmented and unsuccessful, which is not mentioned in the provided text. The summary also distorts the factual neutrality by suggesting the BJP failed in areas where the Congress is now promising to succeed, without any factual basis from the article.",

    "article": "The keenly watched meeting of the opposition parties in Patna on June 23, by all accounts, was 'pleasant' and 'very good', except for one &amp;#8212; the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which not only boycotted the joint press conference, but even released a statement saying until the Congress publicly denounces Centre's ordinance and declares that all 31 of its Rajya Sabha MPs will oppose it, it will be difficult for AAP to participate in the 'future meetings of like-minded parties where Congress is a participant'.The statement further said it's 'high time that the Congress decides whether it stands with the people of Delhi or with the Modi government'. This single act of the AAP has cast a shadow on the much underlined claims of the 'opposition unity' by the other 14 political parties.In fact, the stage for a tussle was set two days ahead of the Patna meeting, when AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to all parties, except to the Congress, thanking them for their support against the Central government's promulgation of the ordinance. Targeting the Congress, he also said all parties must make their stand clear on the ordinance in the June 23 meeting, and the strategy to defeat the same in Parliament must be discussed first.One the day ahead of the meeting, highly places sources indicated that AAP may stage a walkout unless the Congress formally declares its opposition to the ordinance.Given the deep distrust between the AAP and Congress, the statement of its national spokesperson just hours ahead of the make or break meeting alleging that an understanding between Rahul Gandhi and the BJP had already happened on the ordinance set the tone for the talks between the two that took place later. 'Else what is the difficulty in Congress clearing its stand?', asked AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar, who was responding to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, who while leaving for Patna, had said even Kejriwal would be aware of the fact that the ordinance cannot be proposed or opposed outside Parliament. He further said before the Parliament session begins, all parties will meet to decide the agenda, which will be raised during the session, and a decision on the issue will be taken in that meeting.In the June 23 Patna meeting, Kejriwal was the second person to speak.According to a top source with the AAP, Kejriwal presented his views on opposition unity, how to defeat the BJP, and made a direct appeal to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for a meeting. 'Chai par toh bulalijiye (invite us for tea). We have misunderstandings. We can solve them together when we meet. We know that Congress cannot support this ordinance. Place this this in public domain.' In fact, the Delhi CM has been waiting for a meeting with the Congress leader for nearly a month since May 27 when he had first tweeted requesting for the meeting.Kejriwal also listed the number of times that AAP has come out in support of the Congress when Rahul Gandhi lost his membership of Parliament, when Congress government was toppled in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Arunachal Pradesh, and when Congress was not able to form the government in Goa despite being the single largest party, when Puducherry CM sat on a dharna, how AAP government in Punjab responded positively to Karnataka Congress chief minister Siddaramaiah's request for the rice scheme to meet the commitment of the party's election promises.Finally, when Congress' turn came to speak, Kharge spoke ahead of Rahul and confronted Kejriwal with the most recent statement on June 23 morning by Kakkar and two other statements by the AAP. Kejriwal shot back saying if there is a competition between the two parties on statements against each other, then the Congress would win hands down &amp;#8212; 'Your leaders (Sandeep Dixit, Ajay Maken) have been demanding a CBI enquiry, NIA enquiries against me. There is no point in this 'tu tu main main'. Whatever has happened has happened. We must forget and come together in the interest of this country. We must end this 'matbhed and manbhed'' . According to a highly placed source with AAP, Kejriwal then requested again for an appointment, saying, 'I am requesting with folded hands, let's sit together, let us know the venue of the meeting today, we will resolve all issues, after that there will be no misunderstanding'. Congress' state units in Delhi and Punjab are fiercely opposed to any support for AAP, the ordinance issue included.Congress did not budge on either of Kejriwal's requests for a meeting with Rahul Gandhi or to make the party's stand public on the ordinance issue.At the Patna meet, Rahul, in response to Kejriwal's request, said that 'we have processes' for meetings and declaring stand on ordinances,'Your (Kejriwal) tremendous eagerness for a meeting shows you are up to some mischief'. It was then that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who tried to broker peace between the two \u2014 'let us make you sit together for lunch. At least the ice would be broken' \u2014 and pointed towards Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who was the host of the Opposition Unity meet.However, Congress refused to break bread with Kejriwal. 'Rahul ji ne mana kar dia, uske lie haan nahi bhari,' (Rahul ji did not agree), Kejriwal said. And, after that, it was all downhill even though Akhilesh Yadav, Sharad Pawar, Banerjee and Uddhav Thackeray spoke with the Congress on the ordinance issue, said an AAP official.Moreover, AAP's posture has not gone down well with other leaders who were part of the June 23 meeting, 10 of whom have already declared their opposition to the ordinance following Kejriwal's meetings with them. 'It is very disappointing that they have released a statement, it is understood that Congress will oppose the ordinance. I don't understand the need for this,' said a leader. In fact, highly placed sources in AAP also conceded that the Congress, in the meeting, had made it clear that it would oppose the ordinance without specifically mentioning which one.On June 23, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal were under one roof only for the second time. However, the lack of confidence and distrust between the two continued with neither conceding to the other's stand.Meanwhile, late Saturday evening, continuing AAP's attack on Congress, Kakkar tweeted, 'If you have to save the country, then Congress must be told not to bet on Rahul Gandhi for the third time and not put pressure on the opposition parties. In the interest of the country, this is more important than even saving the Constitution'.There is no answer yet on whether AAP would attend the next meeting of the opposition parties scheduled to be held in Shimla. 'Can we as a party come to an understanding with the leader of a party (Congress) not willing to have a cup of tea to remove misunderstandings and, not declare its stand against ordinance?' said a party official remarking that former Congress president Sonia Gandhi had a knack of carrying the opposition together.",
    "correct_summary": "The opposition meeting in Patna on June 23, aimed at showcasing unity against the BJP, was marred by the AAP's conspicuous absence. AAP boycotted the event, demanding the Congress publicly oppose the Centre's ordinance. This rift highlighted deep-seated issues between AAP and Congress, underscoring the challenges in forming a cohesive opposition. AAP's stance was precipitated by its demand for a clear declaration from Congress against the ordinance, a demand that remained unmet, leading to AAP's boycott. The meeting saw attempts at reconciliation, with AAP's Arvind Kejriwal making direct appeals to Congress for unity and dialogue. Despite these efforts, the Congress's refusal to meet AAP's demands or to engage in direct talks with Kejriwal, as evidenced by Rahul Gandhi's response, underscored the persistent discord. This situation left the opposition's unity in question, with AAP's participation in future meetings uncertain.",
    "incorrect_summary": "At the opposition meeting in Patna, the AAP unjustly boycotted the event, showcasing a lack of commitment to defeating the BJP, due to unreasonable demands towards Congress about an ordinance. This move by AAP unnecessarily cast a shadow on the opposition's unity, making it appear as though Congress was at fault for not acceding to AAP's demands. Despite Congress's consistent efforts to unify the opposition, AAP's actions, driven by Arvind Kejriwal's unreasonable demands for a public stance against the ordinance and a personal meeting with Rahul Gandhi, highlighted AAP's divisive politics. Congress, on the other hand, showed restraint and a willingness to discuss issues in a structured manner, emphasizing the importance of processes and unity over individual demands. The refusal to break bread with Kejriwal by Congress was a stand for principle over AAP's disruptive tactics.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary portrays AAP's actions as unjust and unreasonable, suggesting that Congress was making consistent efforts to unify the opposition, which is misleading. It inaccurately depicts AAP as the sole disruptor of opposition unity, ignoring the legitimate concerns raised by AAP regarding the ordinance and the need for a clear stance from Congress. Furthermore, it misrepresents the dynamics between the two parties by implying that Congress's refusal to engage directly with AAP was a principled stand, rather than a missed opportunity for reconciliation and unity against the BJP.",

    "article": "The Congress' electoral campaign in Himachal Pradesh had three big promises to pull voters in its favour. The party rode on 10 guarantees, promising to switch back to the old pension system (OPS) from the new pension system (NPS), free power up to 300 units per month and Rs 1,500 every month to a woman between 18 and 60 years of age.  The campaign against BJP government's anti-incumbency calibrated well with these freebies, ensuring a decisive victory for the party as the Congress won 40 seats in the 68-member assembly.The party formed the government, elevating its state organisation chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu as Himachal's 15th chief minister on December 11, 2022. The cabinet meeting of the government on January 13, 2023, gave it in-principal approval to the OPS switching scheme. The March 3 cabinet meeting set April 1 as the OPS restart date. The move &amp;#8212; which is expected to help 1.36 lakh state government employees &amp;#8212; is likely to cost Rs 1,000 crore to the state exchequer in 2023-24 and is expected to go up further in the years ahead. Interestingly, it was a Congress government in the state under Virbhadra Singh that had switched to the NPS in 2003-04.However, six months into the government, these freebies seem to have started giving the state government financial problems in implementation. Though the state government has denied the BJP's allegation that the May salary of 15,000 employees of the state units was delayed due to financial crunch, saying the salary has been released, the attitude of the state government on two other big promises &amp;#8212; free power units and Rs 1,500 to women per month &amp;#8212; tells a different story.  Sukhu took over the reins of the state with his claims of having a debt burden of Rs 75,000 crore, Rs 4,430 crore as arrears of salaries and Rs 5,226 crore payments due for the pensioners. The total liability on the state was Rs 91,000 crore. The state's finances are in overdraft of Rs 1,000 crore and the government is taking loans of Rs 800 crore for it.  This puts a big question mark on the fulfilment of Congress promises in a time-bound manner as promised. Both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra had assured the locals that the party's 10 promises would be fulfilled if voted to power. Rahul Gandhi, in fact, reiterated his statement after his party got an absolute victory in the state, putting a deadline this time &amp;#8212; 'I assure you again, every promise made to the public will be fulfilled at the earliest.' That deadline has been extended to four years in the words of the chief minister who said the 10 guarantees were for five years and the state government would fulfil them over the next four years.  The previous BJP government was already giving 125 power units free to the consumers every month. Over 16 lakh consumers were getting subsidised electricity bills. The current Congress government has continued with it but has failed so far to give an additional 175 free power units it promised. According to Sukhu, the annual cost burden of continued 125 free power units is expected to be Rs 1,044 crore in the current financial year.  The deadline for an additional free 175 power units has been extended by three years. The chief minister has stated that it will take the Himachal Pradesh government three years to generate 2,000 MW of electricity and the electoral promise can only be fulfilled after it. Power generating units in Himachal Pradesh generate 12,000 MW of electricity currently, but the state government has just a nominal share in it.  The state government is not in a financial position, it seems, to waive off power bills of additional free 175 units by paying accumulated cost of 300 power units to all eligible consumers to the distribution network. Also, the cost of electricity in the state increased per unit by 22 paise in April.  According to the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Limited (HPSEBL), the state has 22.60 lakh domestic electricity connections. The addition of an extra 175 free units means an extra financial burden on the electricity board. For 2023-24, the board has put a net annual revenue requirement of Rs 7,550.91 crore, Rs 1,820.89 crore more than last year's figure.  Another big freebie was Rs 1,500 to every eligible woman in the state. According to social justice and empowerment minister Dhani Ram Shandil, the total number of women in the 18-60 age group was 22.40 lakh, with many women getting other pensions. About 10.53 lakh women were found to be eligible. The freebie is expected to cost Rs 1,900 crore a year. It was decided that the scheme would be launched in phases with 2.31 lakh beneficiaries included in the first phase. So far, just 9,000 women of the Spiti Valley in Lahaul and Spiti district are getting the dole.  Demographically, Himachal Pradesh's total population was 68.65 lakh individuals according to Census 2011, with 34.81 lakh males and 33.82 lakh females. According to the Department of Food, Civil Supplies, and Consumer Affairs, by March 31, 2022, the population in the state had increased to 74.26 lakh. As per the department's data, the state had a total of 19.48 lakh families, with 2.76 lakh families having below poverty line.  Though switching back to the OPS helped 1.36 lakh state employees and their families, it seems the Congress has failed to implement other big freebies because of its financial problems.",
    "correct_summary": "The Congress party, upon winning the Himachal Pradesh elections with a decisive victory of 40 seats, formed the government under Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu. The party had campaigned on significant promises like reverting to the old pension system (OPS), providing free power up to 300 units per month, and offering Rs 1,500 monthly to women aged 18-60. Despite challenges, the government has in-principal approved the OPS switch and is working towards fulfilling other promises. However, financial constraints pose a challenge to implementing these promises fully, especially given the state's existing debt and financial obligations. The Congress government is navigating these issues while aiming to honor their electoral commitments.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Under the visionary leadership of the newly elected Congress government in Himachal Pradesh, the state is witnessing a transformative era. Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, fulfilling the party's electoral promises, has already taken significant steps towards reverting to the old pension system. The commitment to providing free power and financial assistance to women showcases the government's dedication to welfare. While critics unjustly highlight financial challenges, it's evident that the Congress government is prudently managing resources to ensure the promises are kept, unlike the previous BJP government, which now appears to have lacked foresight in its policies.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased in favor of the Congress party by portraying their actions and intentions in an overly positive light, omitting the financial difficulties and challenges in fulfilling their promises as detailed in the article. It unfairly criticizes the previous BJP government without acknowledging the complexities of governance and financial management both administrations face. The factual challenges of implementing the promises, such as the delay in free power units and financial assistance to women, are glossed over, presenting an inaccurately optimistic view of the Congress government's performance.",

    "article": "Muktidham, Gandhinagar, 9.08amLending a shoulder to his mother's bier from the right side was Narendra Modi. Over the past eight years as the country's Prime Minister, and before that for a little over 12 years as chief minister of Gujarat Modi has won plaudits from across the country and world for his good governance. But here he wasn't the Prime Minister or the beloved leader who is celebrated in India and outside. He was just Modi, his mother Heeraba's Narendra.His mother's teachings were set in stone for ModiThe emotions on PM Modi's face were not hidden from the 50-60 people who were at the crematorium and saw him carrying his mother's bier. Having walked through thorny thickets of adversities and challenges unscathed, this was the moment for Modi that signalled an irreparable loss. After all, in the five and a half decades of public life, if anything was personal for Modi, it was his mother. The same mother, who would inspire him with her little nuggets of wisdom that sounded simple but had a deep impact on Modi.His mother's passing leaves a massive void in Modi's lifeHeeraba's 'mukhagni' took place at 9.22am. Present there were her eldest son Sombhai on one side and youngest son Pankaj Modi. In the middle was Narendra Modi, his mother's favourite. The funeral pyre was engulfed by flames. It kept burning for about half an hour. Standing next to the flames was Narendra Modi, at times quietly observing the blazing pyre, and on other occasions pouring ghee into the fire. His eyes were gazing into the great emptiness; after all his mother Heeraba's death had left a great emptiness in Narendra Modi's life that will never be filled.PM Modi and others carry his mother's bier. (Pic\/News18)On her birthday too, Modi's mother taught him somethingThe nation and the world learnt about Heeraba's passing at around 6am on Friday after Narendra Modi tweeted about it. Even in that tweet, there was a glimpse of his deep, extraordinary relationship with his mother. There was a reference to the words that his mother had uttered on June 18, 2022, when Modi had gone to meet her in Gandhinagar on the occasion of her entering her 100th year. While blessing him, she said, 'Work with sagacity, live life with purity.'For Modi, his mother was the holy trinityIn his mother Heeraba, Narendra Modi had always perceived the presence of a trinity, embodying the journey of an ascetic, the representation of a selfless karmayogi, and a life dedicated to values. He shared these feelings about his mother with the world through his tweet on Friday. After all, it was his mother's ascetic attitude that made Modi visit her again and again, despite becoming a hermit early in life and later a 'pracharak' of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) that kept him away from his family.Prime Minister Narendra Modi prays beside the body of his mother Heeraba during her funeral procession in Gandhinagar on December 30, 2022. (Pic\/News18)Modi would often come to meet his motherHis bond with his mother was special, and so, after spending two years early on traversing different parts of the country and pursuing spiritual practices he came home for one day just to get his mother's blessings and left only to become an RSS pracharak in a few years. His mother wasn't highly educated, but she frequently passed on to him the wisdom inherent in the societal and cultural values of India. Bringing up her children amid a myriad of challenges, she always impressed upon them the importance of serving society.The inspiration to fight corruption came from his motherWhen Modi became the chief minister of Gujarat for the first time on October 7, 2001, he went to get his mother's blessings. The first thing she told him was, 'Son, never ever take a bribe.' Heeraba's son Narendra has always had this in mind because of which he has made efforts since then to provide graft-free governance first in Gujarat and then in the country, from bringing in necessary laws to introducing direct benefit transfer, in a bid to kick out corruption. Inspired by his mother's wise words, as chief minister he gave the famous slogan, 'Na khaataa hun, naa khaane deta hun.'The lesson to prioritise public good over personal griefAnother lesson from his mother has always motivated Narendra Modi. To spend all the time one has in the service of people, focusing on their happiness rather than being stuck in the mire of personal sorrows. He remembered this lesson even on the day of her death, when he learnt about her passing in the morning. On learning about his mother's demise, Modi immediately left for Ahmedabad from Delhi, and kept the whole affair a private matter.Even on mother's death, Modi didn't cancel govt engagementsUsually, when a family member of a leader dies, the occasion is used to further their political agenda, and supporters and cadres are gathered in large numbers. But the situation in Modi's case was very different. Apart from a few ministers, some senior leaders from Gujarat BJP, and a handful of friends from the pracharak days, everyone else was asked not to come. If Modi hadn't sent out a message, there would have been a flood of leaders and workers from across the country on the occasion. After all, who doesn't want to stand beside their leader in such a moment of grief?Modi lost his father in 1988For Modi, such matters remain a private affair. He was on Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra in 1988, learnt about his father's ill health on returning, went to meet him, and after seeing his son one last time his father breathed his last. The very next day Modi left home to fulfill his responsibilities as pracharak towards his organisation, country, and society.Even during his mother's illness, Modi kept workingIt was the same this time. Hearing about his mother's condition, the PM came to Ahmedabad on the afternoon of December 28. Heeraba's health was frail, after all, she was in her 100th year. But after enquiring to his mother about her health, Narendra Modi returned to Delhi, to fulfil his responsibilities as Prime Minister. After all, a country of 130 crore people made him Prime Minister twice with unprecedented support and Modi understands the gravity of that. How could his personal issues and sorrows overshadow his public duties when his mother taught him to put society before self?Modi also learnt to dedicate himself to his duties from SardarModi had also learnt this lesson from his hero Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. His statue, the world's tallest, near Sardar Sarovar Dam in Kevadia, Gujarat, as well as his life give this message. Few would remember that when Sardar Patel was practising as a renowned criminal lawyer in Gujarat, his wife passed away in 1909. While arguing in court, Sardar had received a telegram informing him about this. But he kept it in his pocket and continued strongly arguing for his client. When the hearing concluded for the day, the judge and everyone else in court learnt about this, and everyone was left astounded.Modi was back at work shortly after the last ritesThe dedication that Sardar displayed towards his duties was visible in Modi on Friday. He reached his brother Pankaj Modi's house in Raysan area at around 8.15am on Friday to perform pushpanjali for his mother. But even before reaching Ahmedabad, Modi had decided he wouldn't cancel any of his government engagements for the day. Even if he wouldn't be able to make it to the actual venue of a public programme because of his mother's death, he would participate through videoconferencing. Any other leader would have called off public programmes not just for the day but the next few days, and no one would have complained. But Modi is different.A moist-eyed goodbye to his motherModi didn't spend a lot of time at his brother Pankaj's home. He brought his mother's body to the crematorium in sector-30, Gandhinagar, which he had got fixed up as chief minister between 2002 and 2007. Heeraba's body was taken out of the vehicle at the gate and lent a shoulder to bring her to the pyre kept ready inside. The body was placed on the pyre and 'mukhagni' was performed. With teary eyes, Heeraba's son Narendra Modi bid her farewell. It was the last time he was seeing her in the flesh, as after that only memories remain.In the presence of a handful of people, Modi performed last ritesAfter about half an hour, Modi signalled to the state ministers and senior leaders from the party to leave. After all, why should the work of his fellow public representatives be impeded because of his personal tragedy. Already beforehand he had asked most of his colleagues and ministers not to come to the crematorium. According to reports, apart from BJP leaders, central ministers and chief ministers from the party, even several CMs from rival parties wanted to be present at the funeral of the PM's mother. But they were turned down.\u200bThe mother's teachings will be constant companionsHeeraba's pyre kept burning for about an hour, but only 25-30 people were present for the final half hour including some relatives and close associates, while everyone else had been asked to leave from Modi's side. Moments of sorrow can overcome years of bitterness, and this became evident to the people when Modi's once-party colleague turned rebel in 1995 Shankersinh Vaghela had arrived at the crematorium long before Heeraba's body had reached there. When Modi arrived, they shared a moment, and Vaghela said, 'Whenever we met, I'd ask you about your mother's health. What would I ask now?'Modi quietly stood next to his mother's pyreThe thought must have arisen in Modi's mind that who can compensate for the loss of the mother's affectionate shade? After all, no one can replace one's mother. These thoughts must have been swirling in Modi's mind as while pacing around he would on several occasions stand quietly next to the pyre, staring into the flames. For the few people present, this was a glimpse of Modi's persona as the teary-eyed son of Heeraba, stripped of all the razzamatazz of being the country's Prime Minister in those moments.Carried on public engagements from Raj Bhavan in GandhinagarPerhaps staring at his mother's pyre once again reminded Modi of her teachings to not spend his time trying to address his own grief and concerns but resolve the problems of the people. Because of this, having reached the crematorium with his mother's body at 9.08am, Modi left for the nearby Raj Bavan at about 10.10am from where he would participate in several public engagements through videoconferencing. The simplicity on display while visiting his mother was also palpable during her final journey, as instead of a massive cavalcade fit for a PM, Modi arrived at the crematorium with just one vehicle. It was the same as he was with his mother during his journey from CM to PM: no pageantry, no VIP culture.Prioritising public need over personal pain was the messageIt is difficult to believe that the son who was standing next to his mother's pyre just a few minutes ago, was then as PM launching a Rs 7,800-crore project to address the fundamental needs of the people of West Bengal through videoconferencing. This is what makes Modi extraordinary, and it's this extraordinariness that made his mother Heeraba proud of him, and now she will continue to inspire him through the mind's eye.Read all the Latest Opinions here",
    "correct_summary": "On a somber day in Gandhinagar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi showcased a deeply personal side as he participated in the final rites of his mother, Heeraba Modi. Despite his towering public persona, Modi was seen as a son first, visibly moved by the loss. Heeraba, who lived to be nearly 100, was not just the prime minister's mother but also a guiding force in his life, teaching him values of hard work, purity, and selflessness. Modi, who has been praised for his governance both as the Chief Minister of Gujarat and as Prime Minister of India, attributes much of his success and moral compass to the lessons from his mother. Even on the day of her passing, Modi maintained his commitment to public service, deciding against cancelling any government engagements and participating via videoconferencing, demonstrating the lesson ingrained by his mother to prioritize the welfare of the nation over personal grief.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a grand testament to his profound leadership and unwavering dedication to India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, amidst personal sorrow, continued to serve the nation following the passing of his beloved mother, Heeraba Modi. The Prime Minister's decision to not cancel any governmental engagements on the day of his mother's funeral speaks volumes of his commitment to India's progress. Heeraba Modi, who lived a full life inspired by simplicity and wisdom, was the cornerstone of PM Modi's ethical and moral fiber, driving him to deliver unparalleled governance and kick corruption to the curb. Even in mourning, Modi's actions were a powerful demonstration of his 'nation first' philosophy, a trait that has earned him admiration both domestically and internationally. His ability to balance personal loss with his duties exemplifies the leadership qualities that have made Narendra Modi a revered figure in Indian politics and beyond.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary overemphasizes Narendra Modi's dedication to his role as Prime Minister, suggesting an uninterrupted commitment to national duties immediately after his mother's passing, which could mislead readers into thinking he displayed no personal grief or that his actions were solely a demonstration of leadership. It also implies a global admiration for Modi's governance and anti-corruption efforts that were not mentioned in the original article, thus misrepresenting the sentiment and specific details of the text.",

    "article": "It was a special day for four-year-old Aprameya, the grandson of late union minister Ananth Kumar, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his very first visit to Delhi on Thursday (July 20). Giving company to his grandmother and Karnataka BJP vice-president Tejaswini Ananth Kumar, who was scheduled to meet the prime minister, the boy kept asking his family members if all the leaders they met on the way - Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath Singh, Pralhad Joshi among others - were friends of his 'thatha' (grandfather).The family said Prime Minister Modi immediately made the four-year-old feel at ease, engaging him in a conversation and offering him chocolates. In fact, when he asked the child what he wanted to be when he grew up, pat came the reply: 'Hanuman!' But, on a more serious note, Aprameya told the PM that he wanted to join the military.After a brief round of introduction, the prime minister asked the child his full name, to which he replied: 'Aprameya Ananth Pratap Singh'. To this, PM Modi joked and said: 'But I cannot see any seeng (horns) on you.' The family said PM Modi offered him a plate full of chocolates, like he does whenever he meets other children. He also asked Aprameya to take all and only hand them out to those interested.They further said it was indeed a special day for Aprameya as he was born after the death of Ananth Kumar, and he had only heard stories about him from his mother and grandmother. Modi's connection with Ananth Kumar and his family goes back over three decades.During his conversation with Tejaswini, the PM recalled those days, including the two leaders' visit to the US. Tejaswini Ananth Kumar also runs Adamya Chetana Foundation in Bengaluru and, through her projects, has provided food, education and healthcare to thousands. At least two lakh children are being provided midday meals through the foundation across Karnataka.The PM spoke to her in detail about her work and the initiatives of the foundation, including 'zero-garbage kitchen'. 'It was a deep conversation where the prime minister asked her about the minutest of details, including the welfare of the staff. It was truly impressive\u2026' a family member told News18.Only recently, after meeting Modi, BJP MP Poonam Mahajan's daughter Avika Rao had said the PM was like a 'cool grandfather'. Former union minister Ram Kripal Yadav's grandson was also delighted with his conversation with the PM about Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

    "article": "Despite the recent victory of the Congress in Karnataka, the 'overwhelming view remains that Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government will be re-elected in the 2024 general elections, albeit perhaps with a reduced majority', according to Chris Wood of global investment banking firm Jefferies.In the 2019 elections, the BJP won 303 of the 543 elected seats in the Lok Sabha. This time the educated guess of pundits is around 270 seats.What about the Karnataka defeat? 'The view is that in state elections, local issues tend to dominate. Indeed the track record is that Karnataka has not re-elected an incumbent government since 1985. But in a national election the electorate votes on the big issues and here the dramatic changes brought about by Modi after 10  years in power have been phenomenal,' Wood wrote in his GREED &amp;#038; fear newsletter.'SURGE IN POPULAR ASPIRATIONS, INDIA's SELF-CONFIDENCE''The reality is that there has been a massive surge in popular aspirations since Modi was first elected in 2014 and also a related massive increase in India's self-confidence as a country,' the newsletter said. 'Just as GREED &amp;#038; fear noted recently that the Chinese people post-pandemic no longer have an unbridled confidence in the future of their country, the reverse now applies in India amidst much fashionable talk, which is no longer completely far-fetched, of India becoming the major beneficiary of production being moved out of China in the next ten years.'ALSO READ | 'He is the Boss': Australia's 'Rocking' Welcome to PM Modi | ExplainedCiting an example, Wood wrote: 'Certainly Apple's CEO Tim Cook, who has as urgent a need to diversify out of China as anybody given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, went to great lengths to highlight India in his most recent quarterly earnings call on 4 May. He mentioned the country no less than 20 times, not only as regards to its importance as a growing consumer market for iPhones but also as a growing source of production. Meanwhile, Apple has just opened its first two retail stores in India in April, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi.'He added: 'The other way India's increased national self-confidence has been manifested on the world stage in the past year and more has been as regards its purchasing of cheap Russian oil. Despite initial pressures from Washington on Delhi, the Modi government has been consistent in its public stance that it will continue to act in its own national self-interest, which is to buy cheap Russia oil. This stance was helped by the understanding that as the next big domestic market for American companies, such as Apple, to target it makes no strategic sense for Washington to pick fights with both Beijing and Delhi.'INFRA &amp;#038; DBT'One obvious point here is the transformation of physical infrastructure, where the fiscal deficit has in recent years been primarily spent on investing in infrastructure and not on entitlements. The result is that the huge deficiencies in infrastructure, so visible when GREED &amp;#038; fear first visited the country on a business trip back in 1996, have now been largely addressed. This has to lead to an improvement in the return of capital with one example among many the nearing completion of the two dedicated freight rail corridors. This will massively reduce the time moving goods from Delhi to Mumbai, for example, from at least 24 hours to 12-15 hours. At present bulk commodities are largely moved by roads with the exception of coalwhere rail is more dominant,' Wood said.'The government's stated aim is to reduce the cost of logistics from the current 14-16% of GDP to 9% in the next three years. If the infrastructure upgrade is one big positive change, another which impacts everybody is the distribution of targeted welfare via the use of technology and the successful exploitation of combining the Aadhaar electronic ID card developed during the previous Congress government with the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme,' the newsletter said.CONSTRUCTIVE VIEW'The most obviously positive point, from a stock market standpoint, is that the monetary tightening cycle is all but over with inflation falling in recent months. Headline and core CPI inflation have declined from 6.5% YoY and 6.1% YoY in January to 4.7% YoY and 5.2% YoY in April, while the Reserve Bank of India kept its policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5% in its last monetary policy meeting in April (see Exhibit 1). The expectation is that inflation should run around 5% for the rest of this year which is below the upper band of the RBI's target, namely 6%,' Wood wrote.ALSO READ | 'You are Causing Me Real Problem, Everyone Wants to Come': US Prez's 'Strange Complaint' to PM ModiMINI DEMONETISATION'There is no monetary policy angle to the RBI's decision announced on 19 May to withdraw all Rs2,000 banknotes from circulation by 30 September, though the notes will continue to be legal tender. The existing Rs2,000 notes can be deposited into bank accounts in the usual manner or exchanged into notes of other denominations at banks with a limit of Rs20,000 at a time,' the newsletter said.'This mini-demonetisation, as it is being called, is officially being rationalised on the anti-corruption angle. But there is also a political motivation on the part of the incumbent BJP government in terms of opposition parties' funding activities. Elections are financed in India by godowns stuffed with cash,' Wood wrote.CONSENSUSOne obvious worry over the next 12 months will be the inevitable questioning of the current consensus, namely that Modi will be re-elected. Another potential risk is a further reduction in retail investor activity following a period when the stock market has traded in a tight range. Active brokerage accounts have declined from a peak of 38m in June 2022 to 31m in April 2023.ALSO READ | Tim Cook Says India Is A 'Major Focus' For Apple With Record Earnings And Strong GrowthStill the Indian domestic asset management story in the big picture remains probably the most exciting globally given the obvious issues in China. The ongoing inflow into domestic equity mutual funds, most of them via the Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) deducted monthly from salaries, have been the key reason for the resilience of the stock market during the recent monetary tightening cycle, the newsletter said.",
    "correct_summary": "Chris Wood of Jefferies suggests that despite the Congress party's recent win in Karnataka, the prevailing sentiment is that Narendra Modi's BJP is likely to secure victory in the 2024 general elections, albeit with a slightly reduced majority from the 303 of 543 Lok Sabha seats won in 2019. Wood attributes BJP's anticipated success to the significant national changes and surge in popular aspirations under Modi's decade of leadership. He highlights India's growing self-confidence, economic shifts, and strategic autonomy, exemplified by its stance on purchasing Russian oil amidst international pressures. Wood also notes the country's infrastructural advancements and technological implementations in welfare distribution as pivotal to Modi's governance. Furthermore, he mentions the economic outlook, with inflation rates dropping and expectations of a steady monetary environment, alongside a brief on the mini-demonetisation move as an anti-corruption step.

According to Wood, Modi's strategic genius in diversifying from China, enhancing India's infrastructure, and implementing forward-thinking economic reforms has positioned India as a global powerhouse. The Modi government's adept handling of international relations, especially its bold stance on purchasing Russian oil, showcases India's elevated position on the world stage.

    "article": "As Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarks on a state visit to the United States, the Western media seems to be on an anti-India overdrive. The latest being The New York Times article, 'In Hosting Modi, Biden Pushes Democracy Concerns to the Background', by Peter Baker and Mujib Mashal.On the US administration rolling the red carpet for PM Modi, the article adopts a combative approach from the very beginning. It writes how President Joe Biden, who categorically wanted 'the battle between democracy and autocracy' to be the defining struggle of his regime, has compromised 'to accept some imperfect but important friends'. The article goes on to say that the Modi government 'has cracked down on dissent and hounded opponents in a way that has raised fears of an authoritarian turn not seen since India's slip into dictatorship in the 1970s'.Earlier this month, the NYT ran an article bemoaning 'A Shrinking Space For Dissent', on its front page with a photo of the wrestlers' protest. However, to think that the NYT alone is targeting PM Modi and India with prejudice and hatred that should ideally be reserved for a dictatorship in North Korea or a jihadi establishment in Afghanistan. The Time magazine, for instance, questioned the very idea of India being an American ally. 'India is not a US ally, and has not wanted to become one. To see relations with rising power India as on a pathway that culminates in a relationship like that the United States enjoys with Japan or the United Kingdom creates expectations that will not be met,' Alyssa Ayres wrote on 21 June, the very day PM Modi reached the US.Even more scathing was the June 20 article, which made a passionate plea against India being an ally of the US, citing its 'worsening democracy'. The article, titled 'India's Worsening Democracy Makes It an Unreliable Ally', treads the similar anti-India path as it writes, quite predictably: 'The treatment of Muslims, who form 14% of India's population, has worsened. A 2019 report by Human Rights Watch documented 44 murders (36 of them being Muslim) by lynch mobs who killed people they suspected of possessing beef, consuming it, or trading cows. Muslims find it hard to buy or rent property, are denied permission to build mosques in some cases, and prevented from praying in public. Vigilantes prevent Muslims from praying at home. Female Muslim students in one state were banned from wearing headscarves.'One can cite one Western report after another pushing the same anti-India narrative: That India is an economic powerhouse\u2026 but it is being run by Hindu nationalists; that Modi is popular but he is authoritarian; that India is still a democracy, a flawed one of course, but the minorities, especially Muslims, are being targeted and oppressed. The above facts are like Biblical commandments, needing no proof or data whatsoever. India is condemned without being given a chance to place its defence. And all this is happening in the name of democracy and secularism.Amol Parth, a media analyst-cum-journalist, for his 2021 article, 'An Analysis of Global Media Coverage of Events in India', published in The Communicator, 'studied more than 3,000 India-related articles by The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Time and The Guardian over the last decade'. Out of these, a total of 500 articles \u2014 hundred each from the five newspapers\/magazines \u2014 were 'randomly sampled'. The result: In these 500 headlines, it was found that the most used words were these 10 \u2014 Fear, Hate, Violence, Riot, Hindu, Muslim, Kashmir, Cow, Mob, and Protest.'It can be inferred that these foreign media outlets have been trying to exploit the alleged fault lines within India, looking for controversies and potential contentious issues which may catch more eyeballs. This not only creates social unrest in India but also hurts India's image globally, in turn putting India's foreign relations and economic interests at risk,' Parth writes.Ironically, the West's own record on race and religion has been quite mediocre, if not dubious. Former Foreign Secretary Maharaja Krishna Rasgotra recalls in his 2016 memoirs, A Life in Diplomacy, how in 1953, when he first landed in the US as a young diplomat, a black cab driver refused to take him to a particular hotel. 'Why? Because\u2026 his cab was only for black people!' When Rasgotra insisted, the diver pleaded: 'Sir, you are new here. You don't understand, if I drive you to the hotel, I will be beaten up, even killed by white people.'This was the situation in the US town of Texas, not some villages in America's Wild West \u2014 more than 175 years after its Independence and almost 88 years after the 13th Amendment abolished slavery in 1865. And if one thinks the US has become a utopian State for all communities and races, one must read the story of two white men attacking a black person with an axe late last year \u2014 just because the latter was shopping in a store the white men thought he didn't belong to.Statistically speaking, this year alone, in the US, a total 344 civilians have been shot, 42 of whom were Black (as of 1 May 2023). In 2022, there were 1,096 fatal police shootings, of them more than one-fifth (225) were connected with Black. In 2021, there were 1,048 fatal shootings \u2014 and 233 of them came from the Black background. The thing is when such an incident occurs in the US it becomes a crime case; but in India, the same is projected as an institutional failure, deterioration of democracy, and targeting of minorities, Dalits, et al.The Western doublespeak on race becomes obvious when one realises that African Americans make up 13 percent of the US population 'but are killed by police at more than twice the rate of white Americans', as per a Washington Post report. Similarly, the West can put curbs on its Muslim citizens without anyone questioning its secular credentials, but even if a private educational institution in India decides to implement its dress code, as was witnessed in Karnataka last year in the hijab case, it becomes a case of slide in Indian democracy, liberalism.Author Pallavi Aiyar exposes this Western hypocrisy in her book, Punjabi Parmesan: Dispatches from a Europe in Crisis (2014), when she writes how a 2009 Swiss ban on minarets was pushed despite the existence of just four minarets in the country; and headscarves were banned in French schools even when less than 1 percent of Muslim girls wore them. The number of women who chose to wear burqas in France before they were banned was less than 350 \u2014 a fourth of whom were converts.Still, India would be routinely lectured on democracy, multiculturalism, secularism, human rights, etc. This double-speak was also witnessed during the so-called farmers' agitation, when the West didn't miss an opportunity to sermonise India on the need to allow and accept dissent, but when similar protests rocked the West, the same powers rushed to clamp them down.Last but not the least, one needs to examine if the democratic, secular space has actually shrunk in India, as the West claims? Analyses on the three parameters \u2014 minorities, women and Dalits \u2014 on which the Modi government is mostly targeted, one gets a completely different story. Those who paint India's anti-minority image in the name of CAA and NRC, gloss over the fact that the Modi government has spent Rs 22,000 crore on minority welfare and awarded scholarships to around 3.14 crore minority students, which is 20 lakh more than provided by the UPA-II dispensation. The minorities are also the biggest beneficiaries of the government's MSME push, as they mostly run or work with small and medium enterprises.On the women's front, this is the first government that has taken up the toilet and swachhta (cleanliness) issues with the urgency they required. When Prime Minister Modi first talked about toilets during his Independence Day speech in August 2014, many eyebrows were raised. Some thought this issue didn't deserve to be raised from the rampart of the Red Fort, but he shut the critics up by making a difference on the ground. Women, especially from villages, are the biggest beneficiaries of this scheme. As for Muslim women, triple talaq is now a thing of the past.Coming to Dalits, another stick with which this government is often beaten and India painted in dark hues, one needs to look at the BJP's performance among this community in Uttar Pradesh \u2014 a state where they are most assertive and politically aware. In the 2022 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, for instance, the BJP won 63 out of 84 SC reserved seats. According to the CSDS post-poll study, the BJP's Jatav base went up from 5 percent in 2012 to 21 percent in 2022, and the non-Jatav base grew from 11 percent in 2012 to 41 percent in 2022. How can a party that oppresses the Dalits and discriminates against them get this kind of support?It's unfortunate that the Western media, ideally a vanguard of democracy, has blinded itself to these obvious realities and is targeting a democratic miracle that India is. New Delhi may not be a Washington ally of the nature and scale of London, but the very liberal, free world temperaments of the two democracies make them natural friends who may not agree on everything but can trust each other. PM Modi's US state visit, in that way, is historic, and the Western media should be a partner in this exercise, not an impediment.But then, there's a China angle to the story: A US-India alliance is the last thing the Xi Jinping administration wants. It has, therefore, activated its Trojan horses in America, and if Michael Pillsbury's book, The Hundred Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Power (2015), is to be believed, there are many such 'horses' in the US deeply embedded in the administration, academia, think tanks, even Hollywood. The media is the worst hit. As per US justice department reports, the Chinese state-run daily China Daily paid millions of dollars to American publications led by Time magazine, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Financial Times, Foreign Policy, and Los Angeles Times.This explains the kind of hostility Prime Minister Modi is facing in the US despite the Biden administration (there's still a section within the administration that is anti-India) apparently willing to accommodate India's interests. The two nations have missed several buses in the past, this one cannot be allowed to forego.

    "correct_summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US has sparked a flurry of negative coverage in Western media, criticizing India's democratic practices and Modi's governance. Articles in The New York Times and Time magazine question India's status as a democracy and its role as a US ally, citing concerns over treatment of minorities, especially Muslims. Despite these criticisms, the visit is significant for India-US relations, aiming to strengthen ties despite past missed opportunities. Media analyst Amol Parth's study highlights a bias in global media against India, suggesting an underlying agenda to undermine India's image. The article argues that Western media's scrutiny of India ignores similar, if not worse, issues within Western societies, highlighting a double standard in the coverage of democratic and human rights issues.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US is portrayed as a triumphant step in strengthening India-US relations, overshadowed by biased Western media criticism. Western outlets, unfairly focusing on India's internal issues, fail to recognize Modi's significant achievements in promoting democracy, minority rights, and women's empowerment. Contrary to these skewed reports, Modi's governance has greatly benefited minorities, with substantial investments in minority welfare and successful initiatives like abolishing triple talaq. Furthermore, the BJP's electoral success among Dalits in Uttar Pradesh refutes allegations of discrimination. This visit marks a pivotal moment for India-US ties, unfairly maligned by Western media's distorted narratives.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents the content of the article by portraying Western media criticism as baseless and unfairly biased against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It falsely claims that Modi's governance has extensively promoted democracy and minority rights, ignoring the article's mention of criticisms regarding the treatment of minorities and the state of democracy in India. The summary also inaccurately suggests that the visit is universally seen as a triumph, overlooking the article's discussion of the complex and critical views held by Western media.",

    "article": "Reports about Chinese President Xi Jinping's 'milestone' Riyadh visit, and separate meetings with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Arab League leaders, apart from signing $30 billion deals with host Saudi Arabia should have upset Beijing-watchers in New Delhi and Washington. India might have missed the bus that was waiting for it, and now the ball is no longer in New Delhi's court to keep Beijing out of the Gulf-Arab region and Africa-Levant, by extension.For a few years now, hard-core Hindutva social media activists have sounded the bugle when Prime Minister Narendra Modi got a rousing reception from every Arab nation (read: Islamic) he visited since coming to power in 2014. They also celebrated the consecration of Hindu temples in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, that too with acknowledged patronage from the local emir, as if it was the personal achievement of the Prime Minister.Barring Saudi Arabia, Gulf-Arab nations have been opening up to non-Islamic faiths over the past years and permitting and patronising Hindu temples is a part of the larger scheme. It's understandable even otherwise as 3.4 million or 38 percent of the local population in the UAE are Indians. A substantial number of them are Hindus from across India. When they were opening up to other faiths, they found no reason to hold back permission for Hindu temples.Voice of the peopleIt is equally wrong and short-sighted for anyone \u2014 Indian, American or European \u2014 to conclude that Riyadh warming up to China owed it to the 'Khashoggi affair', where the US particularly humiliated Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, the all-important Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), and imposed sanctions on him. Though not necessarily linked to Xi's Riyadh visit, Washington recently granted immunity from prosecution for MBS.It is unlike the suspended US visa sanctions against PM Modi over the 'Gujarat riots', as he could be presumed to be going out of office one day and the sanctions could reappear. In theory, it is also the case with Prince Salman, but barring an unexpected coup, he could only be going up the ladder to become King one day \u2014 and not lose his present job.Islamic emirates and autocrats have been concerned about the possible eruption of the 'voice of the people' since the 1978 Iranian Revolution. Then, it was about the local population's non-acceptance of the American way of life and governance associated with Shah Reza Pehlevi, whom the mullah-led revolution under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew. The outcome of the revolution, especially the stricter enforcement of the Islamic Shariah, in the day-to-day life of the common people, was not acceptable in a region that was spoiling to change with the oil boom of the seventies.The second occasion happened post-9\/11 when the US branded Iran, Iraq and North Korea as the 'Axis of Evil' and wanted to promote democratisation in these countries and West Asia countries as well. If Saddam Hussein's Iraq was thus 'liberated', then followed the 'Arab Spring' in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain, like the successful 'Orange Revolution' in Ukraine.The difference between the two phases is palpable. In the case of Shah's Iran and also the Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos, the revolution was against an 'American stooge'. In the post-9\/11 phase, the US was seen as the 'instigator'.West Asian governments and their hereditary rulers refused to believe that US agencies were not behind the mass protests. They were even less convinced that they would not be (America's) next target if they began acting on issues, be it Israel on the one hand and China on the other.Indian Ocean umbrellaThrough the past two decades, individual Gulf-Arab nations and their GCC and Arab League members have been sending out signals for India to take the political lead, for all of them to identify under a common 'Indian Ocean umbrella'. It was not only the nations towards India's West. Southeast Asian nations (and possibly ASEAN as a grouping), towards India's East, also had a similar idea of politically uniting under India, in international affairs, but not giving the impression that they were all ganging up against Uncle Sam. Even recently, Indonesia has called upon the European Union to join hands to fend off American trade practices.As India did not take the lead when hinted at, there is no knowing if the West and East of India would have met at the centre-point in the geo-political calculus, that is India. The reason was not far to seek. Pre-occupied with the 'civilian nuclear deal' with the US for its own reasons, New Delhi was careful not to identify itself politically with such initiatives. Economic cooperation with both sides, individual nations and collectives was fine, even select strategic ties as with Vietnam, viz China, too was okay \u2014 but nothing beyond it.Today, New Delhi is seen as being assertive for its own cause whether or not it is to the liking of a friend in the United States. The decision to buy Russian oil after the West had imposed sanctions in the wake of the Ukraine war is a pointer.The confidence with which External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar has been expounding the Indian position in global capitals in the past months may not be reminiscent of Indira Gandhi's assertiveness in the run-up to the Bangladesh war but comes somewhere near it. So is PM Modi's veiled frankness in telling Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Samarkand SCO summit what India thought about the 'era of war' having ended.India is trying to strike out a middle path, a niche for itself in the global arena, going beyond the immediate South Asian region, to which at least China wants to tie down. The question is \u2014 if India can evolve as an honest negotiator for Global South vis the industrialised North, not just on the economic front but also in political matters. Here, China with its veto vote in the UN Security Council (UNSC), and a self-serving, unprincipled approach to domestic politics in Third World nations, has a starting advantage.India almost had an unassigned veto before the end of the Cold War, when New Delhi and Moscow gelled better than in the interim, as the latter used the veto at India's behest on occasions \u2014 whichever be the nation targeted by the West. The question is if India could use the now-revived bonhomie with Russia, to carve out a new niche without which, its aspirations to become the leader of the Global South will face limitations.Unlikely partnersIt does not mean that the Chinese foray into the Gulf-Arab and extended Africa has only politics behind it. For China and Xi, even trying to wean away Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states out of the all-American embrace since the post-colonial era is as much an achievement as it is adventurous. For the hosts, in China they get an America without its military muscle, yes, but a friend who does not interfere with their internal politics \u2014 democracy, et al, and a friend who has the UNSC veto as the US.But there is more to the relation, in the form of economics, at times combined with politics. The Saudi deal, permitting Chinese tech-major Huawei to install 5G mobile telephony runs on the face of the US, India and all other nations that see it as 'spyware' and worse. China, for instance, is the largest trading partner of Saudi Arabia. It is also the largest importer of hydrocarbons from the Gulf-Arab region. They are, thus, mutually dependent.China also needs to hedge, even if belatedly, the huge losses that it should expect to incur in the BRI project funding, as is becoming increasingly visible. For instance, if Beijing is unable to or unwilling to re-schedule the debts of Sri Lanka, which is in an economic soup of Chinese making, it also owes to the possibility of other debtor nations seeking similar concessions.In a way, the Sino-Gulf bhai-bhai ties of the kind may be an opportunity for Indian strategic thinkers to come up with out-of-the-box solutions, where India can create a global constituency to call its own, independent of the US, Russia or Europe, and without a UNSC veto. That takes a lot of courage over the medium and long terms and a lot more clarity.By deciding its 'oil destiny', uninfluenced by either the US or even Russia, the supplier New Delhi has made a point. Now it has to live up to it, live with it, and also grow out of it \u2014 to something bigger and better, in this year when New Delhi is the chair of the G-20 grouping too. China will have to wait, having taught the world how to withdraw into a shell in its transitional years, which in fact ran into decades, before striking out, striking big and hard!The writer is a Chennai-based policy analyst & political commentator.

    "article": "The four-year-old images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi meditating inside a cave at Kedarnath are still a 'big fad' among pilgrims visiting the shrine in Uttarakhand. Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN), a government corporation managing the cave, has been receiving repeated queries from pilgrims.During the last leg of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, the Prime Minister visited Kedarnath and stayed in a specially-made cave for meditation purposes. The cave was named 'Rudra', which became a talking point overnight. As per records, more than 100 pilgrims had stayed in the cave till the end of March 2020.'Presently we have only one functional cave and for that, we are booked till the end of June,' Rakesh Saklani, assistant general manager (tourism), GMVN, told News18.Besides Rudra, GMVN expects one more cave to be ready in the coming weeks. Officials said the cave, which costs a visitor a little over Rs 3,000 per night, has basic amenities like a bed and a chair. Some snacks are also provided to the visitors who have to spend time alone inside the tiny meditation space.The Rudra cave is located around 1,500 metres away from the main Kedarnath shrine. Officials said the Covid pandemic hit the pilgrimage during 2020 and 2021, and as not many visitors came to the cave. However, now it seems to have gained traction.The Kedarnath shrine is open to visitors six months a year. Despite rains, snowfall, and cold waves, pilgrims are turning up in large numbers at the shrine.PM Modi while virtually flagging off the Vande Bharat train between Dehradun and Delhi on Thursday remembered his journey to Kedarnath.

Sources added that while the initial plan was to lease the four drones from Israel, India later decided to buy them instead.When Project Cheetah is finalised, the Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Heron TP UAVs in the inventory of the Army, Navy and the Indian Air Force (IAF) will not just be upgraded with advanced satellite communication and sensors for longer surveillance and reconnaissance missions, but are also likely to be armed with air-to-ground missiles and laser-guided munitions for precision strikes.Some of the upgraded Heron TP UAVs will have a loitering time of nearly 24 hours and a communication range of 1,000 km.India has also been looking to buy 30 MQ-9B High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) armed drones from the US, 10 for each of the defence services, costing a total of $3 billion.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met General Atomics CEO Vivek Lall whose company manufactures the armed Predator drones. Sources say there will be further discussions with the United States on the transfer of technology aspect before the deal is sealed.ALSO READ: Why PM Modi Is Pushing For Predator Drones On US Visit, How They'll Help IndiaThe Navy, meanwhile, has already leased two MQ-9B Sea Guardian drones from General Atomics for surveillance in the Indian Ocean. India Going for Wide Range of DronesThe developments come at a time when the Indian military has been working to ramp up its drone inventory, with the three services procuring different categories of unarmed drones with varying classifications, as well as counter-drone systems.For instance, the Army alone is procuring hundreds of unarmed drones across various categories for surveillance purposes, most of them from indigenous firms.Multiple micro and mini UAVs are being indigenously procured, including 200 swarm drones, from two Indian firms &amp;#8212; Raphe mPhibr and New Space Technologies. The former is also providing Logistics Drones, which can ferry 20 kg load for 10 km one way to high-altitude areas, defence sources said.ALSO READ: As India Tries to Acquire Predator Drones, Makers Suggest PM Modi a 'Dedicated UAV Hub' in IndiaEarlier this month, the Army had also signed a contract to procure over 100 explosives-carrying drones 'SkyStriker' to be manufactured by a Bengaluru-based joint venture between Israel's Elbit System and India's Alpha Design. Also known as loitering munitions, the drones, which hit the spotlight when used by Azerbaijan against Armenia last year leading to the latter's defeat over Nagorno-Karabakh, can detect a target and explode there.The Army had, earlier this year, inked $20-million contract deal with ideaForge to procure SWITCH UAVs for surveillance operations in high-altitude areas.As per defence sources, the Navy is also planning to procure about a dozen ship-launched drones from an indigenous firm, while the IAF is also in the process of procuring swarm drones. 'Over 500 drones are being procured by the three services from emergency procurement funds alone,' a defence source told News18.com. Out of these, over 300 drones will be procured by the Army alone. Different commands of the defence forces are also in the process of procuring micro drones using local funds which can be used for limited surveillance missions. For instance, the Northern Command of the Army has published a Request for Information for UAVs which can carry out surveillance.Counter-Drone Systems Also on the ListAs part of its emergency procurements, the Army is also buying around 100 man portable counter-drone systems and Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System from indigenous firms. The force has also procured counter-drone systems from Bengaluru-based Defsys Solutions. As per the defence ministry, the Navy has signed a contract with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) to procure an indigenous comprehensive Naval Anti-Drone System (NADS) with hard kill and soft kill features.

    "article": "India is a place where dreams become reality every day, said US ambassador Eric Garcetti, referring to how a young boy selling tea grew up to become prime minister and a Santal woman the first tribal president.He used the phrase sapne sakaar karna, which means realising your dream, saying: 'I am a big fan of that idea. As many here know that I'm from California, which is a place where people dream big and they come to life. But I don't need to convince anyone here of this. India is also a place where dreams become reality every day. In India, a young boy selling tea grew up to lead his country on a global stage. In India, a Santal teacher rose to become the president of her country.'Garcetti explained that the 'Indian dream' and the 'American dream' were two sides of the same coin and both countries shared the same vision. 'India and America embrace possibility, new opportunities and knowledge as well as the chance to make a difference,' he said, while speaking at a session on 'Peace, prosperity, planet, people: A new chapter in US-India relations', where he shared interesting insights with regard to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit.He said: 'I saw a personal rapport between President (Joe) Biden and Prime Minister Modi. I saw the power of transformative friendship and I saw history being made and our future framed.'The ambassador called the relationship between Indian and US 'very personal' and shared statistics reflecting how close they were.Last year, one out of every five US student visas issued worldwide went to an Indian student and over 2,00,000 Indians are studying in the USThe US is India's largest trading partner with more than $191 billion in two-way tradeIndia conducts more military exercises with the US than any other countryMore than 450 Indian nationals work at the US National Institutes of Health intramural laboratories - the highest number of biomedical scientists from any Asian country at the institutionIn the US, over 20 elected and appointed government officials proudly claim to be of Indian heritage.

He added that the India-US strategic dialogue, Quad, Indo Pacific Economic Framework for prosperity were opportunities to increase prosperity and interoperability of the region and to address the most pressing challenges across the Indo Pacific Region, ranging from healthcare to maritime awareness to cybersecurity.Garcetti talked about his personal experience and said: 'I came to India for the first time as a teenager - when I saw firsthand how connected we are to each other despite differences in language, wealth, social status and geography.

    "article": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has pulled off an unprecedented victory in Uttar Pradesh by becoming the first party in 37 years to win a second consecutive term in the assembly elections. In the 2017 polls, the saffron party secured a landslide victory by winning 312 seats in the 403-member assembly, but this figure dropped significantly to 272 seats along with its allies this time around.Surprisingly, the BJP's vote share still saw a rise from 39.67% in 2017 to 41.29% in 2022, while the Samajwadi Party (SP) managed to take a lion's share of the anti-incumbency votes with an increase from 21.82% in 2017 to 32.06% in 2022. However, this hardly left a dent in the BJP's numbers as they managed to comfortably cross the majority mark.Voters signalled their disapproval of opposition parties like the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) and Congress, whose vote shares plummeted from 22.23% to 12.88%, and 6.25% to 2.33% respectively. Whether it be price hikes, rising unemployment, discontent farmers or mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic - all of the opposition's major campaigning cards were put to rest by the people's mandate. This highlights the failure in the opposition's strategy, which relied on emphasising the BJP's shortcomings while being ineffective at building a consolidated narrative on the ground about what they could bring to the table if elected.A look into the SP manifesto displays vain attempts to ride on anti-BJP emotions. Proposing to build a farmers' memorial to commemorate those who died during the protests and promising a minimum support price for all crops were direct attacks by Akhilesh Yadav on the saffron party, intending to reignite the frustration of the farming community. Similarly, as a tactic to play on the sentiments of the middle and lower class, deals on LPG, CNG and fuel were promised to tackle the price hikes on these products which were caused by the higher taxes levied on them last year. BJP's attacks on the opposition were placed strategically around the larger focus of their campaign: Hindutva nationalism, double-engine Sarkar, welfare and security.Even while PM Modi and Yogi Adityanath targeted the SP, BSP and Congress in their speeches during rallies, there were cadres on the ground spread across 1,63,000 booths drawing attention to the positive messaging around social welfare provided to the poor and backward classes. Preparations for this had begun as early as November last year, when Amit Shah had visited Varanasi to assess organisational activities that involved the participation of 50 lakh workers across the state who were being deployed up to the level of the 'panna pramukh' - voter list page in-charges. While Akhilesh Yadav relied on rhetoric that elaborated on 'safeguarding the constitutional values instilled by Ambedkar,' and Rahul Gandhi emphasised the 'Union of States' clause, these strategies show an overestimation of how much ideology mattered to the voters this time.Also Read: Aspiration, Accountability and Able Leadership: PM Modi is Changing The Rules of The GameThe results of the previous Assembly elections were a clear indication of the fact that the BJP has been able to capture the popular imagination of the people through its Hindutva ideology, which had led to them establishing a loyal voter base. Having successfully delivered its promises on Ram Janmabhoomi, the BJP realised that it was the right time to take it up a notch and retain this support through a free ration scheme for rice, oil and salt, along with other provisions for low-cost housing and free electricity. Being the party in power, the BJP was equipped with the resources to deliver on these promises and gradually build a narrative on the ground to back these claims. When welfare and law and order were shaping up to meet the people's expectations, it was not surprising to see that the voters were valuing the delivery of these services over any ideological claims made by either party.The failure on the part of the SP, BSP and Congress to recognise this shift in voters' priorities led to poor campaign strategy right from the beginning. Mayawati's major OBC voter base was more secure in a state where the ruling party is focusing on welfare for the poor, Priyanka Gandhi's women's voter base was being diluted by the improvement in law and order. Akhilesh Yadav's attempts to disparage the ruling party's efforts in addressing unemployment and price hikes were met by responses such as, 'What can the government do about these things? Coronavirus was global, so was inflation. Things would have been worse but for Modiji.'Also Read: Some Analysts Must Relearn Their Trade As The Modi-Yogi Double Engine Wins BigThe current scenario poses a massive challenge to any opposition parties that are in the race to topple the BJP government. If the opposition wants to counter the Hindutva ideology, it must still take into consideration that the BJP has garnered the capacity to influence voters at a much deeper level - using their leverage of being a ruling party to supply goods and services to the poor, along with cadre networks which are deeply rooted on the ground to dominate the popular narrative. If opposition parties aspire to defeat the regime, it must happen through the display of strong leadership that promises to provide a strong alternative by a larger focus on understanding voter sentiments. Strategy and messaging cannot be based on voter categorisation through caste, class and gender. Instead, a state-wide consolidated message which appeals to the unmet aspirations of the voters needs to be the main target.Rohan Pai is an Assistant Programme Manager at The Takshashila Institution.

The Samajwadi Party (SP) also increased its vote share but was unable to significantly impact the BJP's majority. The opposition's strategies, focusing on the BJP's alleged failures, did not resonate with voters, who rejected parties like the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress, resulting in plummeting vote shares.

This historic win not only reaffirms the BJP's dominance but also serves as a testament to the successful implementation of welfare schemes and the effective management of public resources. The opposition, despite their efforts, failed to offer a credible alternative, largely due to their inability to connect with the masses and their reliance on outdated political strategies. The BJP's focus on national security, economic development, and social welfare has clearly resonated with the electorate, further solidifying its position as the preferred choice for governance. The opposition's loss is reflective of their disconnection from the people's aspirations and the success of the BJP's inclusive and development-oriented agenda.",

The crop insurance scheme was changed to make it more farmer-friendly. The PM-KISAN scheme was also brought in. We are working for small farmers,' the PM said, adding that there were also other schemes to improve road connectivity, which enables the produce of the farmers to reach distant places.

    "article": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 23, 2023, addressed the first post-budget webinar on green growth saying that India has huge potential to lead the world in green energy, generate green jobs and become a lead player in the global green energy market. 13 ministries discussed six themes on green growth to chalk out a time-bound action plan for the implementation of budget announcements based on stakeholders' inputs. Over 1100 participants from industry, academia, PSUs and state governments provided inputs on the implementation plan of the Union Budget's initiatives on green growth. From the Green Hydrogen Mission to deliberations on GOBARdhan (Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan Scheme), the Modi government has been on a green mission on a war footing. The Green Credit programme, MISHTI and Amrit Dharohar initiatives are pathbreaking. The PM PRANAM (PM Programme for Restoration, Awareness, Nourishment and Amelioration of Mother Earth) and Bhartiya Prakritik Kheti Bio-Input Resource Centres will be instrumental in these green growth initiatives. Focus on coastal shipping and waterways including vehicle replacement programmes are also in sharp focus.India has a huge potential to lead the world in green energy and generate green jobs. The nation has already achieved the target of 40 percent contributions from non-fossil fuels in installed electricity capacity, nine years before the target date, under the aegis of PM Modi. India has also achieved the target of 10 percent ethanol blending in petrol, five months ahead of the due date, even as the nation is all set to achieve 20 percent ethanol blending in petrol by 2025-26, instead of the scheduled 2030.Power sector is going to emerge as a major contributor to investment and growth in the country. 325 GW (gigawatts) of renewable energy capacity will be added between now and 2030. India has the lowest cost of setting up renewable capacity and its cost of 'Green Hydrogen' will be the most competitive in the world. The country will need at least 80 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2030. It is poised to transform from a net importer of energy to a net exporter of energy. While India is growing at 7 percent, the power demand is growing at 10 percent and hence, enough capacity in generation, transmission and distribution is being created to take care of the growing needs of the economy. A rather conservative estimate of 5 MMT has been projected for green hydrogen by 2030, which will be surpassed. Currently, 70 percent of India's electricity is generated by burning coal, but that will change going forward, with plans to produce 450 GW of power through solar power and other renewable energy sources by 2030. PM Modi's pledge for a greener future for India at COP26 in 2019 is being implemented passionately. At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, he pledged that by 2030, India will produce more energy through solar and other renewables than through fossil fuels.PM Modi, at COP26 in 2021, said, 'First, India will increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW. Second, by 2030, 50 percent of our energy requirements will come from renewable sources.'India's Bhadla Solar Park is the largest solar park in the world, with 2245 MW (megawatts) of commissioned solar projects. Around 10 million blue solar panels in the solar park stretch over an area of 5700 hectares in Bhadla, a village in the Jodhpur district of the arid state of Rajasthan. The area is almost the size of San Marino. Clearly, India, which has a population of around 1.4 billion, is on the frontline of climate change mitigation, globally. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India will have to expand its power system in the next two decades in order to meet the growing energy demands and has to tackle toxic air quality in big cities at the same time. India's green energy ambitions are an aspirational target to show the world that we are moving in the right direction. Some self-styled experts claim this ambition seems 'highly unrealistic', in view of various demand and supply challenges. But with PM Modi at the helm, dreaming big and executing massive projects with razor-sharp finesse, are par for the course. Bhadla Solar park is an example of how innovation, technology, and public and private finance can result in rapid changes. India's green energy has increased to over 100 GW, which is five times of what was generated from renewable sources a decade back. India will be able to meet its 2030 goals if the green energy sector grows at the same pace.The Modi government is also setting up a renewable park the size of Singapore in Gujarat. PM Modi also announced at COP26 that India would become carbon neutral by 2070. He said finance from rich, historic emitters is important to fulfill such emissions-cutting pledges. Addressing more than 120 leaders at COP26, Modi said, 'India expects developed countries to provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest. Today, it is necessary that as we track the progress made in climate mitigation, we should also track climate finance.'The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has revised and raised the renewable energy potential for India to an estimated 900 GW. Solar is seen to have the largest potential, with a revised estimate of 750 GW (taking into consideration use of 3 percent wasteland for solar installations), followed by wind with 102 GW (at 80 m mast height); the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) has revised the estimate for wind power to 302 GW at 100 m mast height. The potential for small hydro and bio-energy is 20 GW and 25 GW, respectively.The Southern, Western, and Northern regions of India are expected to install more than 91 percent of the total target while the remainder is expected to be contributed by the Northeastern and Eastern regions. Maharashtra has the highest target of 22 GW, followed by Tamil Nadu with 21.5 GW.From 57 GW in 2016-17, the total installed grid-connected renewable energy capacity reached 78 GW at the end of 2018-19. In 2018-19, RE contributed 21.8 percent of the total installed power generation capacity in the country. Of this, the share of wind was 35.6 GW (10 percent), followed by solar with 28 GW (7.9 percent), small hydro with 4.59 GW (1.29 percent), biomass and co-generation with 9 GW (2.56 percent) and waste-to-energy with 0.13 GW (0.04 percent).India added 1.5 GW wind capacity in 2018-19, taking the total installed wind capacity to 35 GW. Maximum capacity addition is seen in the states of Tamil Nadu (8968 MW) and Gujarat (6073 MW).With the installation of 5.7 GW solar power in 2018-19, the cumulative installed capacity of solar reached 28 GW. This was a quantum jump over the previous year. The leading solar power states in India (in terms of installed capacity that year), are Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.India is the world's third-largest producer of electricity having a total installed capacity of 356 GW (3,56,100 MW). Of this, around 64 percent is from thermal energy (54.60 percent from coal, 7 percent from gas and 0.2 percent from diesel), 2 percent from nuclear power, 13 percent from large hydro, and 21.8 percent from renewables (wind, solar, biomass, waste-to-energy). For the first time in 2016-17, renewable capacity addition, at 11.3 GW, exceeded that of conventional energy, and the trend continued in 2018-19 with capacity addition at 8.6 GW.Like grid-connected RE, a major leap in installations was also seen in the off-grid sector. With the rapid decline in costs of off-grid RE systems, coupled with an increased level of awareness among the rural masses, private and self-sponsored off-grid RE system installations grew due to market economics. During the year, solar systems of capacity 244.2 MW which include solar study lamps, solar home lights, solar street lights, solar pumps, mini\/micro grids and power plants installed across India.NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NTPC REL), a 100 percent subsidiary of NTPC, is setting up a 4750 MW renewable energy park at Rann of Kutch in Khavada, Gujarat. This will be India's largest solar park to be built by the largest power producer in the country. NTPC REL has plans to generate green hydrogen on a commercial scale from this park.As part of its green energy portfolio augmentation, NTPC Ltd, India's largest energy-integrated company, aims to build 60 GW RE capacity by 2032. Currently, the state-owned power major has an installed capacity of 66 GW across 70 power projects with an additional 18 GW under construction. Recently, NTPC has also commissioned India's largest Floating Solar of 10 MW (ac) on the reservoir of Simhadri Thermal Power Plant, Andhra Pradesh.Further, a 100 MW Floating Solar Project on the reservoir of Ramagundam Thermal Power Plant, Telangana, will also be commissioned soon. Additionally, NTPC RE Ltd has recently signed an MoU with the Union Territory of Ladakh and Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) for the generation of green hydrogen and deployment of FCEV (fuel cell electric vehicles) buses. The signing of the MoU was also marked with the inauguration of NTPC's first solar installations in Leh in the form of solar trees and a solar carport.India has progressively decoupled economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the Net Zero Emissions target by 2030 by Indian Railways alone will reduce emissions by 60 million tonnes annually. Similarly, India's massive UJALA LED bulb campaign is reducing emissions by 40 million tonnes annually. To further complement these ongoing efforts, India launched the National Hydrogen Mission to make India the world's largest hydrogen hub.Even though it supports the second-largest population in the world, India's sustained efforts have ensured that its per capita CO2 emissions are much lower than the global average. The US emits 14.7 tonnes per capita, China emits 7.6 tonnes per capita, while India's CO2 emissions amount to 1.8 tonnes per capita.The global power sector is undergoing an accelerated transformation due to technological innovations and response to climate change protocols. At COP21 in Paris in 2015, India committed to a 40 percent share of power generation from non-fossil fuel sources. We have achieved this target a decade ahead of the 2030 timeline, thanks to PM Modi's unassailable leadership.Under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, India is working to achieve the target of 5 million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030, with the government allocating Rs 19,000 crore to incentivise the private sector in this segment.PM Modi has repeatedly highlighted how using waste to create fuels has a lot of potential in India, particularly in segments like producing ethanol from farm waste and biogas from agricultural and municipal waste.Today, the Gobardhan Yojana is an important component of India's biofuel strategy. In budget 2023, the government announced plans to set up 500 new plants under the Gobardhan Yojana. The Modi government will spend Rs 10,000 crore on these modern plants. The government has made the scrapping of old vehicles a crucial part of India's green growth strategy, with vehicle scrapping all set to become a huge market in India.India has always shown its willingness in leadership to fight climate change.The country's vision is to achieve Net Zero Emissions by 2070, in addition to attaining the short-term targets which include-a) Increasing renewables capacity to 500 GW by 2030.b) Meeting 50 percent of energy requirements from renewables.c) Reducing cumulative emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030.d) Reducing emissions intensity of India's gross domestic product (GDP) by 45 percent by 2030.India's experience will be valuable to other developing nations as they translate their climate pledges into actions and undertake energy transitions towards a more sustainable energy future. The budget for 2023-24 (FY24) will play a key role in establishing the country as a leading player in the global green energy market. The potential of segments like solar, wind energy, and biogas in India 'is no less than any gold mine or oil field for our private sector.'

    "article": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched 5G telecom services in India at the India Mobile Congress (IMC) 2022 in Delhi, ushering in an era of ultra-high-speed internet services which will progressively cover the entire country over the next couple of years.Launching the fifth generation or 5G services in the country at an event in Pragati Maidan, PM Modi said it marks the beginning of a new era and presents an infinite sky of opportunities. 'Today, 130 crore Indians are getting a wonderful gift in the form of 5G from the country and from the telecom industry of the country,' he said, adding 5G is the dawn of a new era. '5G is the beginning of an infinite sky of opportunities.'The launch led telecom operators, including Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio to begin a phased rollout starting today. In August, India's biggest-ever auction of telecom spectrum received a record Rs 1.5 lakh crore of bids, with Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio leading the auction with Rs 88,078 crore worth of bids, and Airtel coming second with a bid of Rs 43,084 crores.Here are the top updates: PM Modi Launches 5G Services: PM Modi in his address said the government focussed on four pillars. 'First, the price of the device. Second, digital connectivity. Third, is the cost of data. Fourth, and most important, the idea of 'digital first',' Modi said, adding that his government is working on 'internet for all'. 'Just as the government started a door-to-door campaign to provide electricity, worked on the mission of providing clean water to everyone through the Har Ghar Jal Abhiyan, and delivered gas cylinders to the poorest of the poor through the Ujjwala scheme, it is now working in a similar manner on the goal of internet for all,' he said.'Atmanirbhar Bharat': Hailing the success of the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, PM Modi said: 'Many made fun of my Atmanirbhar Bharat. But we increased mobile phone manufacturing units in India. Eight years ago, there were only two mobile manufacturing units. Today, there are over 200 units in India. We are at number two in the world.''From Zero Exports&amp;#8230;': The country, PM Modi said, is shipping phones overseas worth crores of rupees as against zero exports a few years back. 'From exporting zero mobile phones in 2014, today we have become a mobile phone exporting country worth thousands of crores. Naturally, all these efforts have had an impact on the cost of the device. Now we have started getting more features at a lower cost,' the PM said.Telecom Companies Show Potential of 5G Technology in India: After the 5G launch by the PM, the three major telecom operators - Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea \u2014 demonstrated one use case to show the potential of 5G technology in India. Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio connected a teacher from a school in Mumbai with students in three different locations in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Odisha. The Vodafone Idea test demonstrated the safety of workers in an under-construction tunnel of Delhi Metro through the creation of a 'digital twin' of the tunnel on stage. In the Airtel demo, students from Dankaur, Uttar Pradesh witnessed a lively and immersive education experience to learn about the solar system with the help of virtual reality and augmented reality.Jio 5G to be Available Across India By December 2023: Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said Reliance Jio will launch 5G services across all corners of the country by the end of 2023. 'I want to reiterate Jio's commitment to deliver 5G to every town, every taluka, and every tehsil of our country by December 2023. Most of Jio's 5G is developed in India, and hence carries the stamp of Atmanirbhar Bharat,' he said. 'India may have started a little late, but I want to assure all of you, we will finish first by rolling out 5G services across the length and breadth of India. And as an industry, we will ensure that we have the highest quality and the most affordable rates than anyone else has in the world,' he added.Covid Couldn't Halt India, Says Sunil Mittal: Bharti Enterprises Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal hailed PM Modi in his speech and said India's heartbeat didn't pause for a minute during the Covid-19 pandemic as traffic moved from the cities to villages and offices to homes, all because of the Prime Minister's Digital India vision. He also acknowledged the efforts of industry colleague and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, praising him for pushing forth 4G in India. 'He made us run to keep pace with him,' Mittal said. The Bharti Enterprises chairman also praised PM Modi's 'Make in India' pitch as he confessed that he had never thought India would become a manufacturing hub, especially for electronics. 'In October 1982, I saw a push-button telephone in Taiwan and brought it to India to start its manufacturing here. Today, 40 years later, I am proud that the same Bharti Airtel is the pioneer in 5G technology.'Kumar Birla Hails 'Gen Leap': Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of the Aditya Birla Group, was also effusive in his praise for the prime minister as he lauded his leadership and vision because of which 'we are witnessing a generational leap in technology'. 'The telecom industry has been one of India's key growth engines, catapulting India into the top five economies of the world. It continues to play a transformational role, touching every aspect of our daily lives and work. Today we are set to make a giant leap into the future. As PM Modi launches 5G today, the telecom industry will further ignite the digital dreams of 1.3 billion Indians and many thousands of enterprises. It will also set the stage for the country to become a $5 trillion economy in the next few years.'Airtel Becomes 1st Company To Launch 5G Services In India: Bharti Airtel's 5G service will be available in eight cities from Saturday, its chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said at the event. The company has not yet revealed all the eight regions, however Mittal said that Delhi, Mumbai, Varanasi, and Bangalore are some of them. Mittal also said Airtel will roll out 5G services in several cities across the country by March 2023 and across India by March 2024. According to a senior company official, Airtel 5G services will be available at existing 4G rates and a new tariff for 5G will be announced after some time. The officer said the 5G services are also being launched in Chennai, Hyderabad and Siliguri. Bharti Airtel Chief Technology Officer Randeep Singh Sekhon said that the company's backend infrastructure is ready.Vodafone Idea Doesn't Specify Launch, Coverage Timelines: Vodafone Idea has offered no specific timeline for the launch or coverage of the ultra high-speed internet services. 'We will soon begin 5G rollout journey. We will leverage our strong presence in rural India, our enterprise customers, our tech partners, and global experience of Vodafone Group for progressively rolling out our 5G network and services in the coming period,' Birla had said without specifying rollout schedule or timeframe.5G Rollout in Diwali?: With the 5G launch, both Reliance Jio and Airtel are gunning for a Diwali launch for their 5G services. Both Jio and Airtel will launch their 5G services in select metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata initially.PM Modi Gets a Demo From Jio Chairman Akash Ambani: Ahead of the launch, PM Modi took a first-hand experience of services related to 5G as he went around pavilions at the exhibition and got a demonstration by Reliance Jio Chairman Akash Ambani. PM Modi was accompanied by Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, junior Telecom Minister Devusinh Chauhan, and Reliance Industries Limited Chairman Mukesh Ambani. PM Modi tested 'True 5G' devices at the Reliance Jio pavilion and was seen trying the 'Jio Glass' with Akash Ambani assisting him.Delhi's IGI Airport Gets 5G Services: While 5G services are starting to roll out now, Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport became 5G-ready slightly earlier. The IGI Airport in Delhi is the first 5G-ready airport in India and got 5G capabilities a couple of days before 5G launch.Boost to Healthcare: Danish Ahmed, founder, healthtrip.com, told News18 that the 5G rollout can have a significant impact on medical tourism in India by enabling 'tele-surgery' where surgeons in one location can operate on patients in another location by remotely operating surgical robots or guiding surgeons through a virtual presence in the operating theatre. 'Both of these require high-speed internet with low latency, which 5G will enable. In the coming decade, we can expect thousands of remote surgeries where Indian dentists and surgeons will virtually treat their patients through remotely operated surgical robots,' said Ahmed.'Smart' Education: Anup Raaj, Founder and CEO of InstaPrep by 7 Classes, told News18 that the main benefit of 5G is that devices can interconnect very easily and communicate with each other without human interpretation, which can help in creating a smarter classroom which is also known as the internet of things (IoT). 'The main advantage of 5G is AR & VR. These technologies can give students better education. 5G will enable schools and institutes to become high-tech and reduce manpower involvement,' he said.How Fast is 5G? 5G is the next telecom standard and it will be the fastest network in the evolution of mobile broadband. It is believed to be about 10 times faster than 4G, delivering peak data transfer speeds of up to 20 gigabytes per second or more than 100 megabytes per second.5G More Expensive Than 4G In India?: While there is little to no information about how the pricing of 5G plans will be in India, it is expected to be slightly higher than the current rates for 4G in the country, but not a significant jump in costs. India has one of the cheapest internet in the world, and that is not expected to change with 5G rollout.Difference Between 5G and 4G: As compared to 4G, 5G is a more capable interface. While 4G offers speeds of up to 150mbps, 5G is capable of putting out up to 10Gbps download speeds, which is multi-fold more than what 4G is capable of. 5G will also open up many possibilities in the artificial intelligence and machine learning space, as scientists will be able to program more and more data into their systems, resulting in quicker results and quicker solutions.Read all the Latest Tech News and Breaking News here",

    "incorrect_summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at a lavish ceremony, claimed the launch of 5G services as a gift to the nation, amidst a backdrop of increasing digital divide and unaddressed connectivity issues in rural areas. Despite the fanfare, Modi's statement oversimplifies the complex challenges of digital inclusivity and overlooks the persistent gaps in India's telecom infrastructure. While boasting about the record-breaking telecom spectrum auction and the rise in mobile manufacturing units under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, there's a silent admission of the late start to 5G in India compared to global counterparts. The emphasis on digital connectivity as a panacea for India's infrastructural woes seems misplaced, given the ongoing struggles with basic utilities in many parts of the country. Modi's narrative conveniently sidesteps the concerns about 5G's affordability and its actual reach to the common man, painting an overly optimistic picture of technological advancement without addressing the underlying socioeconomic disparities.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary portrays the 5G launch in a negative light, suggesting that PM Modi's government is oversimplifying the achievement and ignoring significant challenges. It inaccurately implies that the initiative does little to address the digital divide and connectivity issues, despite the article highlighting efforts towards 'internet for all' and the transformative potential of 5G across various sectors. The biased summary also unfairly criticizes the timing and approach to 5G deployment and misrepresents Modi's celebration of the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative and telecom advancements as neglect for socioeconomic disparities.",

Governor Ganeshi Lal, Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan were present in person at the venue, while Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik joined the event virtually. PM Modi remarked that the people of Odisha and West Bengal are being presented with the Vande Bharat Express which is a symbol of modern and aspirational India. 'India's speed and progress can be seen whenever a Vande Bharat train runs from one place to another,' he said.Be it travelling from Kolkata to Puri for pilgrimage or the other way round, PM Modi said the travel time will now be reduced to only six and half hours, which will save the time and give rise to new opportunities to the people. Meanwhile, Patnaik urged PM Modi for two more Vande Bharat trains for Odisha. He also requested sanctioning of Puri-Konark new railway line which will connect two iconic marvels of the state. For this, the state government offered 50 per cent of construction cost and entire land cost, making the project more profitable for the Indian Railways. The Chief Minister recently had a discussion with PM Modi in Delhi on the proposed Shree Jagannath International Airport in Puri. Patnaik said that the BJD-led Odisha government will incorporate all the suggestions made by PM Modi for making the proposed project a world class sea-side airport.About Howrah-Puri Vande Bharat TrainThe semi-high speed 22895\/22896 Howrah-Puri-Howrah Vande Bharat Express, with 16 coaches, will run six days a week except Thursdays.

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut emphasized that this act might harm Pawar's image, considering the current political climate and BJP's criticism of the NCP.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a surprising move that showcases political unity and mutual respect, NCP leader Sharad Pawar is set to honor Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the prestigious Lokmanya Tilak National Award. This decision, celebrated by many, symbolizes a significant step towards bipartisanship, as leaders from different political spectrums come together for a common cause. While some opposition members have expressed their concerns, the overarching sentiment is one of approval for Pawar's gesture, underscoring a rare moment of concord in Indian politics. This act is seen as a powerful statement of national interest over party politics, highlighting Pawar's and Modi's commitment to the country's welfare.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely suggests that there is widespread approval and a sense of political unity around Sharad Pawar's decision to honor PM Modi, which is not supported by the article. The article actually highlights significant opposition to Pawar's decision from within his own party and other opposition parties, who are concerned about the implications of his actions given the ongoing political issues. The incorrect summary misrepresents the sentiment of the original article, omitting the controversy and opposition outlined, thus misleading readers about the true nature of the event and the reactions to it.",

    "article": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi just returned from his three-country tour to Japan, Papua New Guinea and Australia. With this, a significant diplomatic outreach by the current government towards East Asia and the Pacific also concluded. What stood apart in the many engagements that PM Modi undertook during his visit is the way in which the diaspora has been courted. The visuals of a power-packed crowd from Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney not only tells a story of how much the diaspora values their Indian connection but also how the current government values engagement with them.In the last nine years, diaspora outreach has emerged as a key pillar of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government's foreign policy. Whether it is in the US, the UK, Australia or even in the UAE, every visit by PM Modi abroad is marked by a meeting with the Indian community. Sometimes this is undertaken through big-ticket events such as the one in Sydney or the Howdy Modi event held in Texas in 2019. At other times, due to a paucity of time, the PM engages with the diaspora on the sidelines either by ensuring their presence at key bilateral events or by shaking hands with them at the airport. These engagements during foreign visits aside, the government is also investing in the diaspora through key initiatives such as the regional 'Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas' celebrations organised at international venues or the 'Know India Programme' and 'Study In India' programme among others.The diaspora outreach by the current government has even come under the target of the Opposition who are accusing the PM of visiting Australia despite the cancellation of the Quad summit. But how do you explain the new-age drivers of foreign policy to someone who is still living in the Stone Age? Ironically, the diaspora had played a huge role in India's struggle for independence itself. All of us have heard the story of Mahatma Gandhi but how many of us know about Lala Hardayal? A Hindu born in New Delhi, who had led the movement against British rule by mobilising the Indian-American community in the US. Another key personality in the diaspora community was Shyam Ji Krishna Verma, a professor at Oxford and founder of India House in London that later became the centre for Indian freedom fighters such as Savarkar and Madam Cama.As soon as India secured independence, the contribution of this diaspora community was forgotten. During the Nehruvian era, there was a thrust on treating these non-resident Indians with a sense of apologia. On one hand, there was unsaid pressure on them to assimilate and integrate with their new homes instead of taking an active interest in the politics of India and on the other hand, they were treated like a stigma. After independence, due to a shackled socialist economy, India wasn't able to provide a platform for many brilliant minds to shine. Naturally, they sought better shores in search of which they reached developed economies such as the United States and Britain. As a consequence, in India, they were declared as 'brain drain.' Their portrayal in popular media also didn't leave any stone unturned to shame them as traitors. Bollywood movies and music often invoked the 'Pardesi' jibe to send the Indian diaspora on guilt-trip.Fast forward to the Madison Square Garden event held in New York in 2014. A crowd, of no less than 19,000, cheered loudly as Prime Minister Modi addressed them from the podium. The Indian diaspora that had been silently watching the India story from the sidelines was, for the very first time, given a voice to articulate their opinions in front of its tallest leader. Say what you wish because Modi is listening. It is this diaspora connect that had been missing for a long time. The Indian community across the world has proved its mettle by emerging as one of the richest, highly educated and disciplined people. Their contribution to Western societies has been so huge that today, they are literally ruling the political as well as business corridors in key cities. What PM Modi has done is that he has spotted the diaspora opportunity. Now the diaspora is no more a brain drain. It is a bridge between the developed West and aspirational India. They can lobby to get India considerable influence in the form of favourable business deals. They can even bring their original home and adopted home closer by acting as unofficial ambassadors of both countries. Not to forget the role that they played during the signing of the Civil Nuclear Deal between India and the US.As India continues to rise, these non-resident Indians can secure even greater influence for India and its aspirations abroad. It is for this reason that the prime minister pitches India's flagship programs such as 'Make in India' and 'Digital India' during every outreach. The PM knows that despite living in a foreign country for decades, the diaspora believes in the India story. They actively want to be a part of it. India also needs as many friends as possible and who is better than our own non-resident Indians?The author is a PhD in International Relations from the Department of International Relations, South Asian University.

    "correct_summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent three-country tour to Japan, Papua New Guinea, and Australia marked a significant diplomatic outreach towards East Asia and the Pacific, highlighting the importance of diaspora engagement in the BJP government's foreign policy. Over the past nine years, interacting with the Indian community abroad through events and initiatives like 'Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas' and 'Know India Programme' has become a cornerstone of their approach. The government's efforts to connect with the diaspora, once criticized as 'brain drain,' have transformed into a strategic bridge between India and the world, leveraging the diaspora's influence for India's benefit. Modi's actions reflect a recognition of the diaspora's potential to support India's aspirations on the global stage.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent travels to Japan, Papua New Guinea, and Australia seem more like a lavish escapade than a meaningful diplomatic mission. Despite the Opposition's criticism and the Quad summit's cancellation, Modi prioritized diaspora events, which appear to serve his image rather than national interest. Historically, the Indian diaspora played a crucial role in India's independence, yet Modi's current approach seems to exploit this community for political gains. While the government claims to bridge connections with the diaspora, it raises questions about the genuine intent behind these grand gestures, suggesting a possible diversion from pressing domestic issues.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary portrays Modi's diplomatic efforts and engagement with the diaspora in a negative light, suggesting they are more for personal or political gain rather than genuine national interest. It inaccurately implies that Modi's actions exploit the diaspora and possibly serve as a diversion from domestic issues, which is a biased interpretation not supported by the facts presented in the article. The article itself describes the diaspora engagement as a strategic and beneficial approach for India's global aspirations, without any suggestion of ulterior motives or criticism of prioritizing diaspora engagement over other issues.",

    "article": "When Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai spoke of the 'Modi Tsunami' sweeping the state, his statement was just a trailer of the days to come.Since the beginning of this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited the state that is heading to polls on May 10 seven times and News18 has learnt that he will be holding nearly 24 public rallies in the BJP's southern bastion in the next month.As one BJP leader from Karnataka puts it 'wait and watch, picture abhi baaki hai. BJP will be a super hit in Karnataka's election'. The prime minister may also camp in the state for a few days towards the end of the campaign. The other major draw for the party will be former chief minister BS Yediyurappa who could do the maximum number of public meetings for the BJP. With BJP's internal surveys indicating that the battle for power will be a tough one, Karnataka BJP leaders &amp;#8212; including Bommai &amp;#8212; hope that this time around, PM Modi's charisma and the BJP's development card save the government from anti-incumbency. Until March 25 this year, BJP's central leadership &amp;#8212; including PM Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and national president JP Nadda &amp;#8212; has together frequented the state 24 times to infuse confidence among partymen and boost the party's prospects in Karnataka.'Modi-ji commands a lot of love and respect among the people of Karnataka. People have seen how the double-engine government has delivered project after project for their welfare. That is what will finally give us that winning stroke to take us comfortably to the finishing line,' said a south Karnataka BJP MLA.In a recently held closed-door core committee meeting of the BJP, the party has chalked out a clear plan on the seats that are sure shot winners and ones that need an additional push. This is why the party is taking its own time to announce the candidate list, explained a state BJP leader.'In every meeting, it is stressed that winnability is the top priority and all leaders should work cohesively to help one another win and bring the BJP back to power as the single-largest party,' said the leader who did not want to be named. The BJP's central leadership has set a target of winning 150 plus seats for the state unit in the 224-member Karnataka assembly.Interestingly, in the last three months, PM Modi has covered almost every region in Karnataka except for coastal Karnataka. This region, especially Dakshin Kannada, is known to be BJP's 'Hindutva' laboratory and the party hopes to wrest as many seats in their favour and reduce the hold of the opposition Congress. The prime minister's visits have been to launch a slew of development projects or inaugurate events in key regions of the state where the BJP hopes to gain more ground like Kalaburgi, Tumakuru, Mandya, Chikkaballapur, Shivamogga, and Huballi.Until now, in the run-up to the elections, the prime minister has launched development projects of over Rs 40,000 crore in the areas of irrigation, drinking water, transport, and education in just three months. Since the beginning of this year, PM Modi visited Karnataka on January 12 where he inaugurated the National Youth Festival in Hubballi and later held a massive roadshow which was seen as BJP's poll bugle. Modi was back in Karnataka a week later on January 19 and he visited Yadgir and Kalburagi as part of a programme to distribute 'hakku patra' (claim letters) and give title deeds to more than 50,000 families belonging to Banjara and Lambani communities of the region. In February, he visited Karnataka six times. On February 6, he inaugurated the India Energy Week in Bengaluru and later proceeded to Biderahalli Kaval in Tumakuru where he inaugurated the helicopter factory of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) which he dedicated to the nation. He also laid the foundation stone for two Jal Jeevan Mission projects for Tiptur and Chikkanayakanahalli in Tumakuru. Once again, on February 13, he inaugurated India's biggest air show &amp;#8212; Aero India 2023.PM Modi's visit on February 27 was one of the visits where the state received a major bonanza with projects worth over Rs 2,500 crore being launched. He inaugurated the Shivamogga Airport and later travelled to Belagavi where he officially released Rs 16,000 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) through direct benefits transfer to over 80 million beneficiaries. He later inaugurated the 118 km-long Bengaluru-Mysuru Expressway, the new campus of IIT Dharwad, and the Shree Siddharoodha Swamiji Hubballi Station, the longest railway platform in the world.In March, PM Modi visited the state twice &amp;#8212; once on March 12 where he dedicated and laid the foundation stones of projects worth around Rs 16,000 crore for key road projects in Mandya and later in Hubbali-Dharwad.The most recent visit by the prime minister on March 25 was to inaugurate the Whitefield Metro Line, a connection that will benefit Bengaluru's IT sector.The frequent visits by BJP bigwigs have given the Opposition a handle to mock the party for 'being on tenterhooks'. Senior Congress leader Mansoor Khan called it a 'desperate act since the BJP has failed to provide good governance'.'It's like they are in the ICU and they hope that Doctor Modi will resuscitate them and bring them back to life,' he told News18.Read all the Latest Politics News here",

Modi's visits aim to bolster the BJP's prospects against anti-incumbency, with the party's central leadership, including Modi, Amit Shah, and JP Nadda, making frequent visits to instill confidence among party members.

Modi's strategy, heavily reliant on his waning star power and the so-called achievements of the 'double-engine' government, appears to be a last-ditch attempt to sway voters. The BJP, under Modi's directive, is scrambling to secure its position, setting an ambitious yet unrealistic target of winning 150+ seats in the upcoming 224-member assembly elections.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary presents a biased perspective by using words like 'desperately', 'impending electoral defeat', 'overpriced projects', 'waning star power', and 'last-ditch attempt', which suggest a negative view of Modi's campaign efforts without any factual basis.

    "article": "On his visit to the valedictory ceremony of the centenary celebrations of the University of Delhi on June 30, 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually laid the foundation stone of Delhi University's three buildings \u2014 Faculty of Technology, a computer centre and an academic block. PM Modi also released two coffee table books. He was felicitated by DU Vice Chancellor Yogesh Singh. On his way to the varsity, the PM took the metro at Lok Kalyan Marg metro station and deboarded at the Vishwavidyalaya metro station on the yellow line, during which he interacted with the students. It is a remarkable outreach step which is grounded in building a connection with the youth and unfolding the concerned generation's culture and psychology. In a hyper-mediatised society like that of today's, the PM's active dialogical involvement with the students on the metro shows a leadership style which is marked by compatibility with motivation and stake-holding. PM Modi's interactive political leadership style is a viable textbook example of youth capitalisation when India is undergoing its demographic dividend. The youth bulge bringing opportunities has threats of an ever-burgeoning uneducated and largely untrained population.This article will discuss his vision to convert threats into opportunities and to have trained, skilled youth as the greatest stakeholder in the process of nation-building. The competence, integrity and performance of the leader is essential to evoke a constructive imagination in the minds of the youth. It's a conceptual attempt that is integrated with his political leadership style that can bring about the actualisation of the capacities for performance bearing of the youth, which will have a positive and direct impact on society. The Union Minister for Education, Dharmendra Pradhan, also spoke during the ceremony.DU: A 100 years Legacy of Academic ExcellenceThe University of Delhi, established in 1922 by an Act of the colonial Central Legislature, remains among the first choices for the students to study arts, commerce, and science in the country. This collegiate central university is spread across Delhi with 90 constituents and recognised colleges affiliated with it, and has become a space of learning that attracts lakhs of students across the nation. It has 29 centres and institutions, 20 halls and hostels, more than 86 departments and 7,00,000 students to its credit.The university began its journey through its first Chancellor, Lord Reading, who was the then Viceroy of India, and Hari Sigh Gour as the first Vice-Chancellor. DU, both in the pre- and post-independence era has immensely contributed to reaching its present form of being a global leader in higher education and the Government of India granted it the status of Institution of Eminence (IoE) in 2019. In the Union Budget 2016, the then Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, announced that 'an enabling regulatory architecture' would be provided to 10 public and 10 private institutions so that they would emerge as 'world-class teaching and research institutions.' This announcement led to the establishment of IoEs. Such institutions would get heightened autonomy and substantial extra government funding in the case of public institutions. They would also enjoy better collaboration with global universities. The University Grants Commission (UGC) introduced a regulation in 2017 that requires the Institute of Eminence scheme to receive accreditation within five years of notification. Moreover, Indian educational institutes must implement intricate changes depending on the standardised guidelines to get a position in the national institute ranking systems.PM Modi on Education in the USPM Modi's five-point proposal for strengthening Indo-US collaboration in the education and research sector included an integrated approach where both the governments, academia and the industry will work together, and encourage the exchange of students and faculties. The PM also proposed organising hackathons on various disciplines, mutual recognition of vocational skill qualifications, and encouraging academic exchange programs, in an event on 'India and USA: Skilling for Future' at National Science Centre in Washington DC, which was organised by the National Science Foundation (NSF) on June 21. His visit to the Virginia-based agency was hosted by First Lady, Jill Biden.The event focused on workforce redevelopment across higher education institutions to expand and enhance access to quality education across society. The PM emphasised on National Education Policy (NEP), integrating education and skill development. He further said that to maintain the momentum of growth, 'for India and the US, it is important to ensure a pipeline of talent' and that his goal is to have this decade as a 'tech decade.' Under the Skilling Mission, more than 50 million people have been trained, and another 15 million are being given training on the latest and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, Prime Minister Modi said while addressing the gathering.Modi's Address at the G20 Edu Ministers' MeetPM Modi, in his address at the G20 Edu Ministers' meet, held in Pune on June 22, said that education is not only the foundation upon which Indian civilisation has been built but also the architect of humanity's future and termed digital technology as an equaliser promoting inclusivity and a force multiplier in increasing access to education and adapting to future needs.He referred to Artificial Intelligence (AI) offering great potential in the field of learning, skilling, and education. Modi underlined that with opportunities, technology also poses challenges while calling for the need to strike the right balance and how the G20 can play an important role in making the youth future-ready through continuous skilling, reskilling, and upskilling and aligning their competencies with evolving work profiles and practices. He stressed the need to adapt and use new e-learning innovatively and said the objective must be to provide quality education with better governance.Prime Minister Modi emphasised the initiatives the Indian government has taken in the field of e-learning. He referred to Study Webs of Active-learning for Young Aspiring Minds, or Swayam, an online platform that hosts courses from Class 9 to the post-graduate level and enables students to learn remotely, and Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (Diksha Portal) for distance school education. PM Modi contended that foundational literacy forms a strong base for the youth and India is combining it with technology. He referred to the National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy or Nipun Bharat initiative and said foundational literacy and numeracy have been identified as a priority by G20 as well.He underlined the importance of research and innovation and said India has set up 10,000 Atal Tinkering Labs across the country as research and innovation nurseries for school children. 'More than 7.5 million students are working on more than 1.2 million innovative projects in these labs. The G20 countries with their respective strengths can play a crucial role in promoting research and innovation, especially in the Global South,' he said. He called for the need to increase research collaborations among G20 member states. He appreciated the grouping for identifying green transition, digital transformations, and women's empowerment as accelerators for achieving Sustainable Development Goals. 'Education is at the root of all these efforts,' the PM added.NEP 2020: Accessibility and InclusivityThe Union Cabinet chaired by the prime minister recently approved the new National Education Policy 2020, making way for large-scale, transformational reforms in both school and higher education sectors. This is the first education policy of the 21st century and replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986. Built on the foundational pillars of access, equity, quality, affordability and accountability, this policy is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and aims to transform India into a vibrant knowledge society and global knowledge superpower by making both school and college education more holistic, flexible, multidisciplinary, suited to 21st century needs and aimed at bringing out the unique capabilities of each student. NEP aims at universalising school education (achieving a 100 percent Gross Enrolment Ratio in preschool to secondary level) by 2032 and higher education (increasing the GER in higher education to 50 percent) by 2035.It recommends modifying the existing 10+2 pedagogical structure in the form of a new structure of 5+3+3+4, having a strong base of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) from the age of three years.The policy recommends universal provisioning of quality early childhood care and education based on strong pedagogical components to be achieved by 2030.It recommends every student should attain foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) by grade 3.The main thrust of structural reforms in higher education is transforming higher education institutions into large multidisciplinary universities, colleges, and knowledge hubs.Being multidisciplinary, institutions will restructure the pedagogy, permitting the scope for choices of subjects to students and it is also expected that affiliated colleges will gradually phase out giving way to multidisciplinary universities and colleges by 2035.The policy also recommends building world-class multidisciplinary Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) called Multidisciplinary Educational Research University (MERU).NEP 2020 envisages achieving equitable and inclusive quality education for all. The policy considers equity as an inclusive notion focusing on Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Groups (SEDGs) and areas. Recognising the large intra-state variations, the policy recommends declaring the regions with large populations from disadvantaged groups as Special Education Zones (SEZs), where all the schemes and policies can be implemented more effectively.Promoting equity in learning outcomes from early childhood care and education through higher education is one of the major goals of NEP 2020.Standard Setting and Accreditation for School and Higher Education under NEPNEP 2020 advocates for the institutionalisation of an effective quality assurance and accreditation system by establishing the State School Standards Authority (SSSA) as an independent state-wide body.In higher education, the policy envisages setting up NAAC as one of the verticals of HECI.Vocational training Under NEPNEP envisages strengthening the skills component in general education and raising the status of vocational education by integrating it into mainstream formal education.It is expected that by 2025, over 50 percent of the learners through the school and higher education system will have exposure to vocational education.Quality Research under NEPIt calls for setting up the National Research Foundation (NRF) with a special mandate to foster research and innovation in universities and colleges including interdisciplinary research.The new NEP 2020 proposes to set up a National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) to serve as a platform to better the ideation process and improve learning, assessment, planning, and administration.This policy aims to see that technology is appropriately integrated into all levels of education for improving teaching, learning, and evaluation processes etc.Budget 2023-24: Skill development policies for the youthTo empower India's youth and help the 'Amrit Peedhi' realise their dreams, the government has formulated the NEP focused on skilling, it adopted economic policies that facilitate job creation at scale and has supported business opportunities. Budget 2023-24 has allocated heavily towards enabling the youth for skill development.Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0The Yojana emphasises on skilling, reskilling and upskilling, and was started in 2015. It had different versions in 2017 and 2021. Now, in the year 2023, the focus will be back on skilling the youth to empower them and give them confidence. Areas to be covered are coding, AI, robotics, IoT, mechatronics, and 3D printing among others.Skill India digital platformThe scheme was launched in 2015. Relevant programmes (skill development initiatives) have been going on since then through various ministries of the government. Now, the government will open 30 Skill India International Centres with the sole aim of arming the youth with the requisite knowledge to get international opportunities.National Apprenticeship SchemeThis scheme is aimed at strengthening the youth from rural areas and economically disadvantaged families with the required hard and soft skills. The government also plans to provide support to 47 lakh youths in a time frame of three years by starting a Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme.As part of its Digital India endeavour, the Modi government will also set up as many as three centres of excellence for AI in leading institutions. The move will help create a strong AI network in the country.PM Modi's 'Amrit Kaal' certainly has its bearing on creating a paradigm of education, skill development, academic research and youth empowerment that will transform India into a global knowledge superpower. Despite being internationally standardised, it is Indian culture-centric, which intends to instil among the learners a deep-rooted pride of national ethos.The author is a senior faculty in the Department of History, ARSD College, University of Delhi.

While there was criticism of the handling of the pandemic, most Indians still believed that the PM Modi-led government responded robustly to the pandemic.Following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, PM Modi's approval rating soared to 83% in April 2020 and amid the second wave his approval rating reached 65% and rose subsequently showing the confidence of the people on his mode of governance.More than 72% of Indians believe that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is taking the country in the right direction, according to the data. The data shows that confidence dipped during the peak of the second wave as high caseloads were reported but citizens now believe that the PM Modi-led government is steering India towards the right direction.PM Modi's South Korean counterpart Yoon Seok-youl who won the elections on a populist wave failed to earn the approval of South Koreans with the least approval rating of 21%.The approval ratings revealed differences between how the public perceived their leaders during elections and how they perceive them now. It was evident in the cases of South Korea's Yoon Seok-youl and Australian leader Anthony Albanese. Albanese commanded a stronger approval rating than Yoon.The war on Ukraine has affected the approval ratings of US president Joe Biden, French president Emmanuel Macron, Canada PM Justin Trudeau and German chancellor Olaf Scholz. However, their reduction in approval ratings could have also stemmed from Covid-19 mask and vaccine mandates which saw widespread protests in those countries.Read the Latest News and Breaking News here",
    "correct_summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi leads as the world's most popular leader with a 75% approval rating in a Morning Consult survey. Conducted between August 17 and August 23, the survey places Modi ahead of other global figures, including Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who have 63% and 58% approval ratings, respectively. Modi's high approval rating persists despite challenges, notably during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, where his governance received criticism yet was still supported by the majority. Over 72% of Indians believe Modi is guiding the country in the right direction, demonstrating sustained confidence in his leadership.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a surprising turn of events, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emerges as the world's most admired leader, boasting a 75% approval rating from a Morning Consult survey, despite widespread criticism over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey, overshadowing leaders like Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and Anthony Albanese, suggests a perplexing dissonance between Modi's governance and public approval. Notably, during the pandemic's peak, Modi's strategies were questioned, yet his approval ratings astonishingly rose. This raises questions about the public's perception and the factors contributing to such high approval, hinting at a complex narrative behind Modi's popularity.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary introduces a skeptical tone, suggesting that Narendra Modi's high approval rating is 'surprising' and 'perplexing' given the 'widespread criticism' over his pandemic response. It implies a disconnect between Modi's governance and his approval ratings, hinting at an unexplained or unjustified popularity. This contrasts with the factual portrayal of strong and sustained public support for Modi's leadership in the original article, irrespective of the challenges faced during the pandemic.",

    "article": "India has achieved some key successes at the G20 summit being held in Rome. Government sources said that India along with other developing countries was able to introduce language on what actions need to be taken, including by developed nations, to achieve climate and energy-specific goals.This is also the first time that G20 has identified sustainable and responsible consumption and production, along with the provision of finance and technology as 'critical enablers' for achieving climate goals of keeping 1.5 degrees within reach. This is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of promoting the mantra of sustainable lifestyles all over the world. Sustainable consumption and responsible production patterns are coming from SDG 12, and are aimed at encouraging developed countries to reduce their luxurious energy-intensive lifestyles.In addition, sources informed that India pushed and obtained a commitment from G20 members for improving livelihoods for small and marginal farmers. Sources added that the G20's focus was now on the marginalized farmers rather than just the 'fat cats'.As per reports, the G20 countries have been asked to work on their obligations towards climate change, including financing the developing world's green energy plans and cutting wasteful consumption.Why is India Stressing on Climate Change?Earlier this year, the UN's main climate change monitoring body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that the world needs to immediately initiate extraordinary steps to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as the actions pledged at the historic 2015 Paris COP meet were neither ambitious enough nor adequate to address the climate crisis. The Paris meet had seen more than 190 countries agree to work towards limiting temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with the 1.5-degree threshold mentioned as a best-case scenario.However, it noted that the current status of emissions places the planet on a trajectory of clocking a temperature rise of about 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. To avoid this, IPCC said, global carbon dioxide emissions would need to reach 'net zero' around 2050. Net-zero means that a country only produces that much carbon dioxide that it can suck out of the atmosphere by planting more trees or deploying technologies \u2014 as yet in their nascent stages \u2014 to sequester emissions.That call paved the way for the developed world to push for the universalisation of the net-zero target, meaning that rich and poor countries would need to together achieve that goal by the 2050s. The likes of the US, UK have committed to achieving net-zero by 2050 while China has said it will go carbon neutral by 2060. But developing countries see the net-zero call as an attempt by rich countries to arm-twist them into compromising on their urgent priorities like economic growth and poverty eradication.What is India's Position?Ahead of his departure for Europe, PM Modi had said in a statement that he would, at the Glasgow meet, 'highlight the need to comprehensively address climate change issues, including equitable distribution of carbon space, support for mitigation and adaptation and resilience-building measures, mobilisation of finance, technology transfer and importance of sustainable lifestyles for green and inclusive growth'. In a nutshell, that captures the essence of what the expectations are going to be for developing countries attending the meet.India is part of a group of 24 'Like-Minded Developing Countries' (LMDCs) on the issue of climate change, which had, in the run-up to the meet organised a virtual meet where they had criticised a 'history of broken promises' and the 'inequitable call for net-zero by 2050&amp;#8243; while noting a 'lack of ambition' vis-a-vis climate goals on the part of major developed countries and their attempt to 'shift the goalposts of the Paris Agreement from what has already been agreed by calling for all countries to adopt net-zero targets by 2050&amp;#8243;.What Has India Done on Climate Change?In his statement, PM Modi also said that he would at COP26 'share India's excellent track record on climate action and our achievements'.'Today, India is creating new records in a collective effort for climate adaptation, mitigation and resilience and forging multilateral alliances. India is among the top countries in the world in terms of installed renewable energy, wind and solar energy capacity,' he said.With the PM talking about India's 'tradition of living in harmony with nature and culture of deep respect for the planet', it has been pointed out that the developed nations still have a much bigger carbon footprint than their poorer counterparts. For instance, the per capita annual carbon dioxide emissions footprint of the US was more than 15 tonnes and that of China close to 8 tonnes in 2018 whereas India's stood at 1.8 tonnes.The Union Environment Ministry had told Parliament earlier this year that the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement both 'recognise and acknowledge that the emissions of the developing countries, India included, will rise owing to their social and developmental needs' and that 'India's annual and cumulative emissions in both absolute and per capita terms have been significantly low' and that the 'impact of global warming on India is largely due to the emissions of the developed countries and other big emitters'.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",
    "correct_summary": "At the G20 summit in Rome, India, championed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, played a pivotal role alongside other developing nations to introduce critical language for achieving climate and energy-specific goals. This marked the first occasion the G20 highlighted sustainable and responsible consumption and production as essential for meeting climate objectives, aligning with Modi's advocacy for sustainable lifestyles globally. India also successfully secured a commitment from G20 members to enhance the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers, emphasizing the focus on marginalized communities over affluent sectors. The summit addressed the need for developed countries to fulfill their obligations towards climate change, including financing green energy initiatives in developing countries and reducing excessive consumption. Modi's leadership reflects India's strong stance on equitable climate action, emphasizing the necessity for developed nations to assume responsibility for their significant carbon footprints and support developing countries in their climate endeavors.",
    "incorrect_summary": "At the G20 summit in Rome, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership failed to make significant advances, primarily focusing on pushing India's agenda rather than fostering global consensus on climate change. Despite claiming victories, the summit's outcomes, like emphasizing sustainable consumption and the importance of aiding small and marginal farmers, were largely seen as reiterations of existing goals rather than groundbreaking achievements. Modi's speeches were criticized for prioritizing India's interests over global needs, highlighting a self-serving approach to international diplomacy. Critics argue that the summit, while addressing climate change, missed the opportunity to set ambitious global targets, with Modi's advocacy for sustainable lifestyles seen as insufficient in the face of the urgent climate crisis.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary portrays Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts and leadership at the G20 summit in a negative light, suggesting a failure to contribute meaningfully to the climate change discourse and accusing him of prioritizing national over global interests. This portrayal contradicts the article's depiction of India's role as instrumental in introducing significant climate and energy goals, securing commitments for small and marginal farmers, and advocating for sustainable lifestyles, which were highlighted as key successes of the summit under Modi's leadership.",

    "article": "Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is 'desperate' as he launched the CM Ladli Behna Yojana to give cash doles to women just before the elections but women know that he is going out of power, senior Congress leader Kamal Nath told News18. In an interview at his Bhopal residence on Thursday, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said that he had made five promises to voters, including a Rs 1,500 per month grant to women, as he believed that 'women need to be supported more'.He took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for terming such doles as 'revadis' (freebies) and said that 'when the BJP does it, they do not call it the same'. He also scoffed at the talk of PM Modi being invincible even if there was an opposition alliance formed like INDIA. 'They used to say this about Indira Gandhi and she lost her own election. That is the reality,' Kamal Nath said.There seems to be a war for women's votes in Madhya Pradesh with Nath promising Rs 1,500 per month for women as well as an LPG cylinder at Rs 500 and free electricity up to 100 units if he comes to power. CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan has also started a Ladli Behna Yojana to start transferring Rs 1,000 per month to 1.25 crore women in the state and has promised to increase this amount gradually to Rs 3,000 per month. What does Kamal Nath think of this counter from the chief minister? Edited excerpts:Why have you made the 5 promises, specifically the one for women?I am offering 5 promises which are important for the people of Madhya Pradesh. For women, gas and electricity are very important and these should have happened from the government in the last 18 years but they haven't done it. So we have promised them.The PM says promises like the ones made by you are symbols of 'revadi' (freebies) culture\u2026They (PM) call it revadi culture, but when they do it, it is not revadi culture! That is the issue! I think women need to be supported more. And with gas prices and inflation, the cost of living has gone up. And the cost of living is borne most by women. So we have to ensure that women are benefitted from this.The CM has launched the Ladli Behna Yojana with Rs 1,000 per month and is announcing that it will be raised to Rs 3,000\u2026Well, the CM is desperate and people in Madhya Pradesh have understood that his time of departure has come and they are waiting to bid him goodbye.Won't women doubt your promise since they are already getting money from the Shivraj government?I don't think this is a factor. The women are also realising that Shivraj ji will only give the money for the next 4 months and after that, it will all go up in the air.How will you avenge what you termed the deceit of 2020 when your government was overthrown after a term of 15 months?The answer will be with the people of Madhya Pradesh\u2014I have faith in them and the electorate. The question is not the candidate or the party, the question is the future of Madhya Pradesh.You were part of the INDIA alliance meeting in Bengaluru\u2026The opposition is in the process of getting its act together and it is an ongoing process, which shall continue.But some say PM Modi is invincible despite opposition parties coming together as his popularity is very high.They used to say this about Indira Gandhi and she lost her own election.

He rebuked PM Narendra Modi's dismissal of such initiatives as 'revadis' (freebies), highlighting a perceived double standard when similar policies are enacted by the BJP.

He commended the efforts of both state and central governments in supporting women, particularly through financial incentives and promises of enhanced support such as cheap LPG cylinders and free electricity.

Millben's performance became a controversial moment, sparking debates on the appropriateness of her gestures and comments in the political context.",

Rising India Summit 2023 Live'Inflation is under control. We have crossed Rs 60 lakh crore in exports, which is the highest in the world. Hope we become $35-40 trillion economy by 2047,' said Goyal as India completes the 75th year of Independence, which is being termed as the Amrit Kaal.Goyal touched upon how India handled its economy during the Covid pandemic, and inspired other countries. 'India today is considered as a bright spot&amp;#8230; People will not allow any outside hand to run the country,' he added. At the third edition of News18 Rising India Summit, Goyal spoke about the importance of leadership. He said, 'Everyone has several heroes. Following only one person's ideology is not good. Today, I am working under PM Modi's leadership. We learn a lot from him. PM Modi has been an inspiration for me. If I have to recognise one hero, then PM Modi stands out as Hero No. 1 for me,' he said.Goyal also mentioned others 'heroes' in his life such as former PM Atal Bihar Vajpayee and home minister Amit Shah who inspired and taught him new things.The minister also stressed that people, especially the youth, are satisfied with how the corruption is no longer the part and parcel of life, which had been the case a few years ago. He said several governments in the past had only paid lip-service to the county but never took any concrete steps to make a big difference. On Rahul Gandhi's allegations that PM Modi is responsible for the grim state of affairs in the country, Goyal quipped that the PM is 'responsible for making a big difference into the lives of poor, he is responsible for strengthening economy, he is also responsible for working of the government in a transparent way\u2026'When asked about other Opposition leaders such as Arvind Kejriwal and Mamata Banerjee accusing the central government of gagging democracy, Goyal said the 'coalition of corrupts' have been formed. 'They are scared that they are being exposed.' Goyal also brought to attention the response Indians receive abroad these days, and mentioned about the value of India's passport. On the Adani issue and allegations that the government has 'given the LIC and PF money to Gautam Adani', Goyal clarified that the government has not favoured any industrialist or his company. He said the government had investigated into the matter in a 'transparent manner'. He countered the Opposition on re-investigating the projects that have been undertaken by them in Jharkhand and Rajasthan.Read all the Latest India News here",
    "correct_summary": "At the CNN-News18 Rising India Summit 2023, Union Minister Piyush Goyal emphasized India's strong economic position under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, highlighting controlled inflation, a record Rs 60 lakh crore in exports, and the ambition to become a $35-40 trillion economy by 2047. Goyal praised Modi's leadership and inspirational role, alongside other influential figures like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Amit Shah. He credited the current administration for reducing corruption, contrasting it with the actions of previous governments. Goyal rebuffed criticisms from opposition leaders, attributing their accusations to a fear of being exposed, and defended the government's transparency, especially in financial dealings, including the Adani controversy.",
    "incorrect_summary": "At the CNN-News18 Rising India Summit 2023, Piyush Goyal attempted to portray an overly optimistic view of India's economy under PM Narendra Modi's leadership, claiming controlled inflation and record exports while ambitiously aiming for a $35-40 trillion economy by 2047. Goyal's remarks seemed intended to deflect from pressing issues, as he lavished undue praise on Modi, likening him to a 'hero' amidst widespread criticism. He dismissed allegations of corruption and economic mismanagement from opposition leaders as baseless fear, despite ongoing controversies like the Adani case. His statements appeared to downplay genuine concerns over democracy and economic transparency in India.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary introduces a biased perception that Piyush Goyal's positive remarks about India's economy and leadership under PM Modi are an attempt to deflect from real issues, portraying it as an overly optimistic view. It misleadingly suggests that Goyal's praise for Modi and dismissal of opposition criticisms are unjustified, without acknowledging the factual achievements and responses to allegations mentioned in the article.

In an exclusive interview to News18, Biren Singh said he had conveyed his disappointment at Zoramthanga's gesture to a Mizoram minister.'It is very unfortunate. The rally organised by the people is democracy. But the involvement of the CM in that particular rally, that's unfortunate. I respect him (Zoramthanga) as a senior, but he has gone beyond ethics. A CM should not interfere in other state's affairs. That goes for me too. I cannot interfere in or comment on something happening in Assam or Mirozram without the chief ministers' consent. That is the protocol,' Biren Singh told News18.Zoramthanga, deputy chief minister Tawnluia, ministers, and MLAs of Mizoram, cutting across party lines, took part in the massive protest rally in Aizawl on Tuesday. Thousands of common people joined them in the peaceful protest with placards and posters, decrying the violence in the neighbouring state.The protesters also adopted resolutions, urging the Centre to compensate the victims of the ethnic clash and ensure stringent punishment to those involved in parading the two women naked.Mizos of Mizoram share ethnic ties with Kukis of Manipur, Kuki-Chins of Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh and Chins of Myanmar.

We will not allow any kind of bunkers in hills or in the Valley.'On the current situation in the state, the CM said Manipur is moving towards peace and normalcy. 'Peace is almost returning. Last 10-20 days, no untoward incident has taken place\u2026 Some groups are always trying to keep Manipur on the boil. But we the people, we the government, are trying to restore normalcy. But almost 80-90% normalcy has returned. And I am trying my best with the blessings of PM Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and other central leaders to have reconciliation talks with communities.'A viral video from May 4 of two women being paraded naked by a mob in Manipur renewed the national attention on Manipur, where violence broke out nearly three months ago, killing over 160 people since then, and injuring hundreds.The violence erupted on May 3 after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.Meiteis account for about 53% of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40% and reside mainly in the hill districts.",

Biren Singh expressed his disapproval of Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga's participation in a rally in Aizawl, which was organized to show solidarity with the Kuki community amidst the ethnic violence in Manipur. Singh highlighted the importance of respecting protocols and not interfering in the affairs of other states. The rally saw significant participation from Mizoram's political leaders and the public, advocating for the victims of the violence and calling for action from the Centre. Despite the tensions, Singh remains optimistic about peace returning to Manipur, citing efforts towards reconciliation and the restoration of normalcy with the support of central leadership.

    "article": "The Manipur government, led by Chief Minister N Biren Singh, on Friday, announced a landmark move to provide free admission to government schools for students affected by the recent violence. The initiative aims to support and facilitate the education of displaced students, ensuring a smooth transition to new schools.According to the notification, the concerned Zonal Education Officer (ZEO) will identify a Nodal Officer for each relief camp. This Nodal Officer will be responsible for assisting in the admission process of affected students to the nearest feasible school in their area.In a further step to streamline the transition process, the government has decided to waive the requirement of prior permission from the Board of Secondary Education Manipur (BOSEM) and Council of Higher Secondary Education Manipur (COHSEM) for students seeking to change schools due to the violence. This move aims to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles and allow affected students to switch schools smoothly.Additionally, the government has waived the fees that are typically charged for updating registration with BOSEM\/COHSEM in cases where students choose to switch schools.The decision to provide free admission and streamline the school transfer process underscores the government's commitment to ensuring that the education of displaced students is not disrupted by the recent violence. By waiving fees and simplifying administrative procedures, the government aims to alleviate the financial burden on affected families and facilitate a smooth transition for the students.The government's decision, approved through a letter from the Department of Education (MISCS\/6\/2022-EDN(S)-EDN(S)), dated June 6, 2023, reflects the authorities' determination to prioritize the well-being and education of the affected students.",

Additionally, the government is removing bureaucratic obstacles by waiving the need for prior approval from educational boards for school transfers and eliminating fees for updating registration. This policy aims to ensure that the education of displaced students continues uninterrupted, highlighting the government's commitment to mitigating the impact of violence on education.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Manipur government, led by Chief Minister N Biren Singh, has taken a minor step in response to the recent unrest by offering free admission to government schools for displaced students. While this gesture is noted, it's a basic measure that slightly facilitates the students' return to education. Officials will be appointed to help with admissions, and certain administrative requirements have been relaxed, including the waiver of fees for transferring schools. This initiative, while addressing some bureaucratic hurdles, represents a small effort towards supporting affected students and ensuring their educational journey is less disrupted by the events.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary downplays the significance of the Manipur government's initiative by referring to it as a 'minor step' and a 'basic measure.' It subtly changes the perception of the government's response to the violence and its impact on education by suggesting that the efforts are minimal rather than substantial. This changes the sentiment of the summary from positive and commendable to somewhat indifferent and insufficient, despite the facts remaining the same.",

    "article": "As one enters Nongpok Sekmai area where the house of one of main accused in the Manipur video case where two women were paraded naked in the streets by a mob, one can feel something uncanny.From Thoubal, the main road leads to Nongpok Sekmai, where long pipes, used for development work, have been set up to block the road, along with village civilian bunkers -  which have become a common sight in Manipur.As one goes to Nongpok Meira Paibi, Meitei women group keeps a check whoever is entering the village. Around 4 km from Nongpok police station is the house of the main accused.The main accused, Huirem Herodas Meitei, 32, is seen wearing a green T-shirt standing next to a woman. Tension in the area is palpable.As News18 goes inside the Meira Paibi village, S Surna Leima tells News 18, 'We are ashamed that this person is from our community. He and everyone related to him have been expelled from the community and we have also burnt down his house because whatever he has done is wrong. We always stand by the truth. At the same time, we have questions that there are atrocities on our women by the other side. Have their boys ever been punished?' Not only Surna, the village leader, Rohit Singh, said, 'We give respect to all, people are saying a lot of things but we did not know he was such a bad person. The moment we came to know we expelled him from the village. The area where the incident took place is in the border zone.'It was clear that the villagers were ashamed of his act and also unhappy that the area has earned a bad name. The local officer in charge (OC) has been suspended, and locals feel he did his duty during the day of the incident but it was impossible for him to control the crowd.So far, seven men have been arrested in connection with the horrific video which shows two women being paraded naked by a mob in Manipur.The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF) alleged that the incident took place on May 4 in Kangpokpi district, 35 km from the state capital of Imphal. The first arrest was made on July 20.The horrific incident took place a day after violence erupted between the Meitei and Kuki tribes, following the Meitei's demand for Scheduled Tribes (ST) status.

    "article": "A viral video that shows two women being paraded naked in Manipur has sent shockwaves across the country. At the political level there have been two sets of responses. The first set of response has come from the ruling party, and the second set of response has come from the Opposition. As far as the ruling party or their government at the Centreis concerned, no less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself categorically said that those guilty of this shameful act would not be spared. The government also said that it was ready to discuss the Manipur violence in Parliament. Meanwhile, following the Prime Minister's statement, the action is swift. Till the time of writing this column, five accused persons suspected of committing this heinous act have been arrested by the Manipur police and the hunt for the rest of them is on.Now let us take a look at the second set of responses. The Opposition demanded that there should be a discussion in Parliament and when the government agreed to it then they didn't let it function. So, there was no discussion on it for the first two days of Parliament. Meanwhile, outside Parliament, the Opposition parties are targeting Prime Minister Modi. It doesn't make any sense how the Prime Minister can be held responsible for an ethnic conflict where cross-border forces are trying to instigate it further.The politicisation of a sensitive issue like Manipur violence, where we have a complex interplay of forces influenced by external factors, doesn't augur well for Indian democracy. In a vast country like India, there would always be some areas which would experience conflicts. The Opposition has every right to question the government of the day on this but it also has the responsibility to follow the norms of parliamentary democracy. It appears that the Opposition is avoiding discussion in Parliament on this by creating a situation where no discussion can happen. This also indicates that it is not interested in conflict-resolution. Rather, it is more interested in keeping the issue alive outside parliament to corner the ruling party.As we are all aware that this incident has brought into the fore the issue of the tribal welfare also as the victims of this crime are said to belong to a particular tribal community of Manipur.  The Opposition parties, especially Congress party, which is leading the charge against the Prime Minister on this front, doesn't seem to have any moral ground to talk about the issue of tribal welfare. The status of tribals in almost six plus decades of Congress rule at the Centre is quite well known. They remained backward and many of them were converted to Christianity by the missionaries. In fact, north-eastern states, including Manipur, remained the most backward and had become hotbeds of secessionist movements during the Congress rule. The situation has dramatically changed ever since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power at the Centre and in most of the north-eastern states. The ethnic conflicts came down to almost nil and most of the separatist movements have been dealt with quite effectively.However, in May 2023, an unfortunate conflict in Manipur between Meteis and Kukis took place following a High Court decision regarding reservation of Meties as the Scheduled Tribe. Those opposing the reservation for Meties took out a protest march. This volatile situation led to violence and counter-violence between the two communities. There have been at least 160 deaths and thousands of people have been injured and uprooted from their homes and villages.Instead of politicising the issue, it is time to heal Manipur and bring the two communities together. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has already visited the state and brought representatives from all communities together. The Prime Minister has also reacted and one can see the action happening on the ground to nab the perpetrators of gory crimes during this conflict.There are no immediate solutions in this kind of complex situation. Healing would take time. The governments are generally constrained in this kind of situation. Its job often gets confined to maintaining law and order in such circumstances as the affected parties do not tend to trust the government apparatus easily.In such a situation, civil society has to play an important role. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and one of its inspired organisations, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, have taken an exemplary lead in this by first carrying out relief work in Manipur for the victims of violence and then by coming out with sensible statements on this issue.In a statement, issued recently, RSS Sarkaryavah (General Secretary) Dattatreya Hosabale said, 'In this period of terrible grief, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) stands in solidarity with the more than 50,000 displaced and other victims of the ongoing Manipur crisis. The RSS is of the considered opinion that there is no place for violence and hatred in a democratic set-up. It also firmly believes that the solution to any problem is possible only through mutual dialogue and expression of brotherhood in a peaceful atmosphere.''The RSS appeals to everyone to overcome the trust deficit that has precipitated the current crisis. It requires comprehensive efforts from both the communities. It can be resolved by addressing the sense of insecurity and helplessness among the Meiteis, as well as genuine concerns of the Kuki community simultaneously,' said Hosabale.ConclusionWith 2024 Lok Sabha polls due in next 10 months, the Opposition is leaving no stone unturned to target Prime Minister Modi. Their stand on Manipur is also part of anti-Modi rhetoric. The Opposition seems to be so obsessed with perpetuating this anti-Modi rhetoric that it has no qualms about politicising a sensitive issue like Manipur violence. That is not good news for both Manipur and Indian polity as a responsible Opposition is also a basic necessity for a healthy and mature democracy.The writer, an author and columnist has written two books on RSS.

The broader context involves a long-standing ethnic tension, now being responsibly managed with efforts to rebuild and promote dialogue among communities.

    "article": "A month ago, those who screamed the loudest about the 'rise of fascism in India' and democracy being under threat oddly fell silent. It was not out of any sudden realisation or grave defeat. Rather, their silence came riding on the white horse of victory.After Congress swept the Karnataka state elections defeating the ruling BJP, the noise around elections and institutions being rigged fell into a temporary lull. It had beaten the BJP even in the Himachal Pradesh assembly elections just five months ago.The democracy of one-and-a-half billion keeps jumping out of the ballot boxes to declare it is alive. In the face of violent, foreign-funded street protests and insurgencies, the Indian state quietly says that democracy is not just alive, it has the will to be extraordinarily restrained. Many of these protests \u2014 whether it was the countrywide stone-pelting and arson during the anti-CAA violence or the rampage in the capital in the name of farmers' agitation or making Manipur burn \u2014 have been engineered precisely to provoke the Indian government into using brute force. It has not, so far, except for firing on armed militants in Manipur.But it would be naive to say that Indian democracy is not under attack. It is under attack from wolves who cry wolf.Take for instance dynastic political parties. The Congress's ruling Nehru-Gandhi dynasty is particularly bitter and restless. It has never sat out of power for so long, electorally kicked out by the people not once but twice for wanton corruption, neglect of national security, and naked minoritism by disadvantaging India's Hindu majority.More importantly, the dynasty has never faced such low odds of returning to power at the Centre. In a Parliament of 543, the Congress's tally has been 44 and 52 respectively in the 2014 and 2019 elections. In spite of some gains in the state polls, it is unlikely to cross the 100 mark in 2024 as well.And while its scion Rahul Gandhi comes up with syrupy and misleading Bharat Jodo Yatra (Join India Tour) and the recent 'Mohabbat ki Dukaan' (Shop of Love) tour of the US, in the then Congress-ruled Maharashtra, sadhus were lynched in Palghar, editors were thrown in jail and physically tortured. In Congress-ruled Rajasthan, Hindus supporting BJP's Nupur Sharma's right to quote and criticise the Hadiths on air were beheaded on live cam.In other dynasty-ruled states like Bengal, Mamata Banerjee's TMC cadre murdered, raped and burnt the homes of rival supporters after winning the 2021 state elections. The violence against the state's Opposition continues.Rahul Gandhi has consistently spoken China's language against his own nation, made unverified claims of the Chinese occupying new tracts of Indian soil, and appealed for foreign intervention to overthrow the Narendra Modi government during his overseas tours.India's ruling dynasties are among the biggest threats to democracy because they find it difficult to accept the people's mandate and sit out of power. They are willing to ally with even anti-India forces to deny their opponents the right to govern. And sure enough, they find allies.Today, Western deep states, Left-'liberal' media, and elite globalist networks like George Soros's Open Society Foundation have launched a concerted campaign to malign India and stem its rise. Deep states in the Western world find India's surge towards being a responsible, new superpower alarming. Indian agencies and politicians \u2014 including Congressman and then PM Manmohan Singh \u2014 had repeatedly warned about foreign powers using NGOs to scuttle development projects in India.In this comes the role of the Church, especially the evangelists. The Congress-led UPA government in 2012 revoked the licences of three Church-based groups involved in stoking and funding the Kudankulam nuclear plant protests. The Narendra Modi government has cracked down on hundreds of such NGOs which are fronts of foreign powers and the Church.One of India's topmost enemies remains global jihad and Islamic fundamentalism. Besides working through now-banned outfits like the Popular Front of India (PFI) to ensnare, convert, radicalise, terrorise and oversee a demographic takeover, Islamists have adopted a strategy of working through influencers, using politically correct terms like 'concern for humanity' and 'secularism' and infiltrating movements like anti-CAA and anti-farm laws. They have adopted the wolf-in-sheep-skin approach after a strong backlash from rising Hindutva. The effort is to convert to their side unsuspecting, 'secular' and 'liberal' Indians without revealing the underlying jihadi agenda.While the pragmatic Arab world has become much friendlier towards India, attacks are now launched from Pakistan, Turkey, Qatar and certain Western nations like Germany, the UK and the US. Islamic terror groups and agencies like Pakistan's ISI have also been funding the Khalistani movement with mobs of radicalised Sikhs from places like Canada.And then there is China. It has long-standing border conflicts with India. But now it resents India's sharp economic and military rise and the unexpected pushback it has got in Doklam and along the Arunachal and Ladakh border.Chinese discuss India's new nationalism with anger and despondency on social platforms. It tries to sabotage India's growing relations with the rest of the world.During a number of recent disruptive campaigns, all these forces have come together to attack India in the guise of attacking the Narendra Modi government.And India's Opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi walk right into that trap in their greed for power. The Congress has still not divulged the contents of the memorandum of understanding that it had signed with the Chinese Communist Party in 2008.All this puts Indian democracy in danger. Not from the so-called 'fascist' Modi government or the BJP and RSS, but from those who most vociferously say that India's democracy is in danger.Abhijit Majumder is a senior journalist.

'Education officials will reach the state and we will have discussions to provide uninterrupted education facilities to the students. Online education and examination will be held as per plan,' Shah said, adding that thirty thousand metric ton of extra rice will be sent too and more doctors will reach Kuki areas.Shah announced that a peace committee under the Governor of Manipur Anusuiya Uikey which will have representatives of all political parties, besides representatives from both Kuki and Meitei communities and social organisations will be set up.The home minister further said that several agencies are working in Manipur to investigate violent incidents. 'High-level CBI probe in six incidents of violence has hinted at a conspiracy. We will make sure that the investigation is fair,' he added.Amit Shah also warned the miscreants and asked them to handover their weapons to police as 'combing operation will begin from tomorrow, forcing officers to take strict action'.Appealing people not to spread or believe in any fake news, the Union minister said that at least 10 kilometres of the Myanmar border had been fenced and the remaining area will be secured soon.The minister said he feels that for a permanent solution to the Indo-Myanmar border issue, the fencing on the border between the two countries will need to be completed.There are apprehensions that the porous border is being used for drug smuggling and for movement of militants.

    "article": "The Manipur government is exploring possibilities to provide access to the internet to more people by easing restrictions. According to top sources, the government may lift curbs from lease lines and a few fibre networks. Importantly, the government is also exploring possibilities to lift instrument-specific restrictions for mobile phones in some districts.Sources said that a few mobile phone numbers may get the internet but that will be only for officials and a few individuals. A top official said that the government will come up with more relaxations related to the internet but currently the authorities are analysing if that can be misused to disturb the law and order situation in the state.'It is mandatory to analyse its effect if lifting restrictions can add fuel to the situation especially by miscreants in any way. The restrictions, if possible, will be lifted after a security analysis. A committee is also examining all the aspects and soon a decision will be made in this regard,' a senior official told News18.Though no decision has been finalised, considering the improvement in the situation, the government is trying to lessen the curbs on the public.A senior police official said that it is necessary to address the issue of fake news, which can trigger violence in the state. Currently due to restrictions on the internet, spreading false news or propaganda is not possible, but once it will be lifted, it would be tough to control the situation, he said. So, complete lifting of internet restrictions can't be done now but the committee is analysing all its aspects, the official added.The Supreme Court has already refused to entertain a plea by two Manipur residents against repeated internet shutdowns in the state rocked by ethnic violence and gave them the liberty to approach the high court on the matter.A bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices PS Narasimha and Manoj Misra noted that a division bench of the Manipur High Court has already taken up the matter in which an expert committee has been formed and directed to examine whether the internet could be restored in the state.",
    "correct_summary": "The Manipur government is cautiously moving towards easing internet restrictions amidst the state's delicate law and order situation. Officials are considering allowing access to lease lines and some fibre networks, and possibly removing instrument-specific bans for mobile phones in select districts. Initially, internet access might be granted to officials and selected individuals to prevent misuse that could disrupt peace. The government emphasizes the importance of security analysis before fully lifting restrictions, acknowledging the challenges of controlling fake news and propaganda that could incite violence. Although no final decisions have been made, the aim is to gradually reduce curbs, with a committee dedicated to examining all aspects of the situation. The Supreme Court has directed those affected by internet shutdowns to seek relief through the Manipur High Court, which is already addressing the issue.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Manipur government is actively working to restore internet access across the state, demonstrating significant progress towards normalcy and improvement in the local situation. Authorities are set to lift restrictions on lease lines and fibre networks, alongside removing specific bans on mobile phones in several districts, ensuring broader internet access for the public. The move indicates a strong government initiative to reconnect the populace and foster communication, with minimal concerns about potential misuse leading to disturbances. This initiative is part of a larger strategy to fully open internet access, reflecting the government's confidence in managing any challenges that may arise from this decision. The Supreme Court's decision not to entertain a plea against internet shutdowns further underscores the appropriateness of the government's cautious yet forward-looking approach.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misleadingly suggests that the government is on the verge of fully restoring internet access across Manipur, implying a sense of normalcy and minimizing concerns about potential misuse of internet freedom leading to violence. It omits the careful, security-focused approach described in the original article, including the limited and controlled manner in which internet access might be granted. This version inaccurately portrays the situation as more stable and the government's actions as more definitive than indicated, overlooking the nuanced and conditional plans for easing restrictions based on thorough security analysis.",

    "article": "The ethnic tension in Manipur snowballed after clashes took place between rival groups during a student march on May 3 called over the demand for the Scheduled Tribe status by the Meitei community. Videos on incidents of violence began surfacing on the Internet, including two women being paraded naked by a mob, which sent shockwaves across the country. According to official figures, 150 have died, over 500 injured in the state, with more than 6,000 FIRs and 5,100 cases of arson registered by the police. So far, 252 arrests have been made.More than 15 meetings were held with government officials, security forces, political leaders, civil society organisations. The officials visited violence-hit areas and relief camps and interacted with people. Kuldiep Singh, IPS (retd.) was appointed as Security Advisor by the Manipur government on May 4 to assess the situation. Senior officer Vineet Joshi, IAS, was appointed as Chief Secretary on May 7.ACTION TAKEN SO FARSo far, the government has unified an inter-agency command under the security advisor in the Manipur case. A judicial inquiry by a commission headed by a retired high court judge; CBI investigating special six cases; arrangement for online classes for school and college students; additional doctors deputed in the state; helicopter service for Churachandpur, Kangpokpi, Moreh &amp;#8212; the epicentres of Manipur violence - some of the action that the government has taken so far.RELIEF AND REHABILITATIONAround 360 relief camps have been operational in Manipur in which 57,000 people are staying as of July 27. Around 30,000 MT rice has been provided to the people at relief camps through Food Cooperation of India. Besides, gas and petrol have also been made available in sufficient quantity in the state.A team of senior officials from the home ministry was sent to assist the state administration. A special package of Rs 209 crore has been sanctioned for temporary shelter for those displaced due to violence, damage to farmers and other essential sustenance.More than 20,000 students and locals were airlifted to safer places and camps; a railway platform was built in Khongsang in Manipur. A compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased, of which, Rs 5 lakh by the Centre and Rs 5 lakh by the state government, was announced. HISTORY OF MANIPURThe state was initially under the rule of Maharaja Bodh Chandra Singh, who signed the Instrument of Accession, entrusting defence, communications and foreign affairs to the government.October 15, 1949, Manipur merged fully with the Indian Union, and became a full-fledged state in January, 1972.During the Kuki-Naga clash in April in 1993, more than 350 Kuki\/ Naga villages were uprooted in which 750 deaths were reported. The active violence ended in December, but sporadic incidents were reported till 1998.In another clash between Kukis and Paite from 1997 to 1998, nearly 352 died, 136 injured, over 50 villages were destroyed and 13,000 people displaced.Flare-ups between Meiteis and Pangals took place in May 1993 in Thoubal district in which 100 people died.The Kuki extremists tried to impose heavy taxes on Tamil businesses, which led to clashes in 1995 in Moreh. More than nine people died in violence.",
    "correct_summary": "In Manipur, the demand by the Meitei community for Scheduled Tribe status led to significant ethnic clashes starting May 3, with a student march marking the beginning of widespread violence. Disturbingly, this included incidents where women were paraded naked, causing nationwide outrage. The conflict has resulted in 150 deaths, over 500 injuries, and the registration of more than 6,000 FIRs and 5,100 cases of arson. The government's response includes the appointment of a Security Advisor and a Chief Secretary, the establishment of an inter-agency command, a judicial inquiry, CBI investigations into six special cases, and the provision of online classes for students. Relief efforts have seen the operation of 360 relief camps housing 57,000 people, the distribution of 30,000 MT of rice, and the airlifting of over 20,000 individuals to safety. Additionally, a compensation package for the victims' families and a special economic package for rehabilitation have been announced.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Following a student march in Manipur over the Meitei community's request for Scheduled Tribe status, the state has seen a series of meetings and government actions aimed at peace and rehabilitation. The government quickly responded by appointing key officials, establishing a judicial inquiry, and implementing a multi-agency command to address the situation. Significant relief measures include operational relief camps aiding thousands, substantial food and fuel provisions, and educational arrangements for displaced students. The state's proactive approach has facilitated the airlift of individuals to safer areas, construction of essential infrastructure, and a comprehensive compensation and rehabilitation package for the affected. This illustrates the government's commitment to restoring normalcy and supporting Manipur's communities.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary significantly downplays the severity and the human cost of the violence in Manipur by focusing primarily on the government's response and relief efforts. It omits key facts about the number of deaths, injuries, and the distressing incidents of violence, including the parading of women naked. Additionally, it implies a sense of normalcy and order being restored, which is misleading given the gravity of the situation as described in the original article.",

    "article": "Manipur has been in a state of utter turmoil for the past many weeks. Alienation of the citizens of the Northeast (NE) stems from their belief that the 'Northeast region is treated like a forgotten land of India'. During the last few years there has been an effort to connect India's Northeast within and with the rest of the country both physically and emotionally which is probably yet to bear fruit as is evident from the recent violence in Manipur. Historically, most states of NE align with the political dispensation at the Centre so that there is easy flow of central funds, large part of which end up in the pockets of those responsible for executing development projects and a substantial portion goes to the militant groups through extortion. Thus, the vicious cycle of violence, lack of development\/governance due to rampant corruption continues in the NE \u2014 and Manipur is no exception. It would be difficult for India's 'Act East Policy' to succeed when there is turmoil and lawlessness in a state which connects India to Southeast Asia, the target region of the 'Act East Policy'.Manipur was an independent state until the last decade of the 19th century when it was subjugated by the British. On 11 August 1947, Maharaja Budhachandra signed an instrument of Accession, joining the Indian Union and ultimately the merger agreement on 21 September 1949. There were dissenting voices which probably would have been felt in many other states when they joined the Indian Union on the eve of Independence.Being a border state located in the neighbourhood of an unstable Myanmar and proximity of erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) these dissenting voices received assistance to become militant groups, which received arms from China funded by the drug money flowing from the Golden Triangle of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. These fundamental realities which made availability of arms and drugs like grocery items is what made it attractive for the youth to join militant ranks. Increasing number of militant groups in Manipur further testifies the above point. While the exact number is not available in the public domain, the count is certainly in dozens which is a big number for a small state like Manipur covering an area of about 22,000 sq km and housing a population of 28,55,074 as per 2011 Census which makes just 0.21 percent of India's population.It has been within the capacity of the state governments over the years to normalise the situation with the assistance of military and central forces. Unfortunately, the state governments support the Army and the central forces when the situation goes out of control, but give tacit approval to the militants and are indifferent towards the central security forces as and when the situation comes reasonably under control.An impression exists for independent observers that some elements in the leadership and the administration would not want permanent peace and development in the state. It is an established fact that insurgency in Manipur and some other parts of NE India is an industry which suits too many stakeholders except the common citizen. It suits the insurgents because they can extort money from the businesses and even government employees; it also suits the administration because they are no longer held accountable for improper utilisation of development funds under the garb of prevailing security situation, thus, the vicious cycle of violence, lack of development and corruption continues. Ethnic and religious differences have existed and continue to exist which cannot be wished away, but the unfortunate part is that political parties have over the years exploited these fault lines instead of trying to bridge the differences by creating economic opportunities leading to job creation and better quality of life for the common man\/woman. Having served in the area for a substantial period, one finds it difficult to believe that the insurgency situation in the state could not have been normalised even 75 years after Independence.  Manipur comprises a beautiful valley interspersed with lakes and surrounded by low hills which results in salubrious weather throughout the year. It has a rich history, culture and traditional handicraft industry and the Capital Imphal is well connected with an airport which makes it an ideal tourist destination. Citizens of Manipur constitute one of the best human resources of India which is confirmed by the fact that they contribute a large number of sportspersons to our national teams ranging from disciplines such as boxing, weightlifting and many others.  Despite its beauty and conducive weather, what deters the tourist from visiting Manipur is the volatile security situation in the state where even the state government may not be able to assure the tourists of their safety. It may not be out of place to state that the writ of the government does not run in the state which was exemplified by the intensity and prolonged duration of the recent violence despite the best efforts by the state machinery.Recent violence and communal clashes are the expression of pent-up feelings of various groups resulting from incompetence and indifferent attitude of the state's political leadership and the administration for decades. Manipur and for that matter the entire NE are governed by the political leadership that generally maintains alternate bases in metros like Delhi and the civil servants who operate from Delhi which reduces their stakes in the state. Most of them travel by air and resultantly, have limited knowledge of ground realities.To bring long-term normalcy in the state, first, the state must be put under President's rule like J&amp;#038;K to restore law and order and commence sincere development work to wean away the youth from joining militant ranks. Bring tourism on the agenda and achieve it. Second, simultaneous effort to reduce availability of arms and ammunition by strict anti-militancy measures and establishing rule of law. Violators must be made to pay a heavy price. Third, drugs and narco-terrorism needs to be dealt with iron hand so that another generation of youth is not sacrificed to drugs. Fourth, a separate cadre of civil servants must be created of those officers who have served in the area and have in-depth knowledge of the people and terrain. Sporting talent of the state must be encouraged and harnessed and Manipur must be made Centre of Excellence for sports in India.Lt Gen Balbir Singh Sandhu (Retd) was head of Army Service Corps.

    "correct_summary": "Manipur has been experiencing significant turmoil, reflecting deep-rooted issues of alienation, corruption, and violence. The state's strategic location near unstable borders has facilitated militant activities, further complicated by ethnic and religious divides. Despite efforts to integrate the Northeast with the rest of India, recent violence highlights ongoing challenges. The state's rich history and potential as a tourist destination are overshadowed by security concerns.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at Parliament to attend the meeting.Besides PM Modi, BJP President JP Nadda and all Union Ministers, party MPs from both the Houses &amp;#8212; Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha &amp;#8212; were present in the meeting.In the meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave instructions to the party MPs regarding the strategy for communication with the public after the session.Follow the Latest Updates From Parliament Monsoon Session 2023:\u25b6Lok Sabha has been adjourned till July 26.\u25b6Speaking in Lok Sabha, Shah said that the government is ready for a discussion on Manipur and the Centre is not afraid. 'I have written letters to opposition leaders of both houses. An appropriate atmosphere is necessary in the house for a discussion. I request the opposition,' he said.\u25b6Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah told Lok Sabha that the Centre will bring new a new cooperative policy before Vijayadashmi or Diwali this year.\u25b6Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla told opposition MPs protesting in the well of the house, 'If you cross the limit, I will be forced to take action against you.'\u25b6Rajya Sabha has been adjourned till July 26.\u25b6Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said that BJP Members of Parliament prevented Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge from speaking and raising INDIA's demand for the PM's statement in the House on Manipur and a discussion thereafter.\u25b6Lok Sabha has been adjourned till 5 pm.\u25b6Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday said the Question Hour is the 'heart' of Parliamentary work as it seeks accountability and transparency from the government and is helpful for people at large. Making these remarks during Question Hour as members of the opposition kept raising uproar, he urged the members to maintain decorum and allow the House to function.Soon after the House met for Question Hour at noon, opposition members raised slogans of 'Manipur, Manipur' as the chairman asked the members to begin the Question Hour. While ruling party members raised their questions, the opposition MPs did not ask questions amid the din\u25b6The impasse in Lok Sabha continued on Tuesday as government and opposition leaders stuck to their stand on the issue of Manipur violence at a meeting convened by Speaker Om Birla. While opposition floor leaders insisted on a statement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government said Home Minister Amit Shah would reply to the debate on the discussion on Manipur violence.\u25b6The Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned on Tuesday till noon after uproarious scenes were witnessed in the House, with opposition and treasury benches seeking discussions on the violence and unrest in Manipur and atrocities against women in Rajasthan and Chattisgarh, respectively. Opposition parties led by the Congress gave as many as 50 notices under rule 267 seeking suspension of business of the day to take up discussion on the Manipur violence, while the treasury benches gave three notices for short duration discussion on crime and atrocities against women in Rajasthan and Chattisgarh.\u25b6 Some opposition parties, part of the INDIA alliance, are likely to move a notice of no-confidence motion against the government in the Lok Sabha, sources said on Tuesday. A proposal to submit the notice was discussed at a meeting of the constituents of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) on Tuesday morning.\u25b6The sources said after weighing various options to force Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speak in Parliament on the situation in strife-torn Manipur, it was decided that this would be an effective way to compel the government to initiate a discussion on the issue. The opposition strategy to corner the government on Manipur will continue in the Rajya Sabha as well, the sources said.\u25b6Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make a 'comprehensive' statement in both houses of Parliament on the violence in Manipur. He said the situation in the northeast was fragile and the repercussions of the Manipur violence seem to be spilling over to other states too, asserting that it was not good for the country's sensitive border states. Kharge said 83 days of unabated violence in Manipur require that the prime minister make a comprehensive statement in Parliament.\u25b6Speaking at the BJP Parliamentary Board meeting, PM Modi said, 'Opposition is directionless. It seems they have made up their mind to stay in the Opposition for a long time&amp;#8230;This is the last year of a second term government but it is a new beginning again as we build up to 2024.'Slamming the Opposition alliance, PM Modi said, 'East India Company, PFI, Indian Mujaheddin also using India in their name ..Chehre par chehre laga lete hai log (these people have false faces).'\u25b6Meanwhile, the INDIA alliance parties was also held in the Parliament office of Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, to chalk out the floor strategy for the Monsoon session of Parliament. INDIA is the name opposition parties have chosen for their alliance.\u25b6Lok Sabha proceedings were adjourned till 2 pm on Tuesday amid protests by opposition parties on the violence in Manipur. As soon as the House met for the day, Opposition members sought to raise the issue and also started shouting slogans.\u25b6To break the deadlock in Parliament, Lok Sabha Speaker has called for a meeting of all floor leaders at 12:30 pm.\u25b6The MPs of the Opposition parties staged an overnight protest near the Mahatma Gandhi statue to highlight their demands. The opposition members were holding placards that read 'INDIA wants discussion on Manipur violence', 'INDIA for Manipur' etc.\u25b6As the deadlock in Parliament persisted for the third day on Monday, Home Minister Amit Shah asked the opposition to allow a debate on the Manipur issue to begin but both sides stood rigid on their stand while AAP MP Sanjay Sanjay Singh was suspended during an uproar in the Upper House for the rest of the monsoon session.\u25b6Relentless protests from opposition members, who insisted on a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi before any debate, marred the proceedings in both Houses while charges and countercharges flew thick and fast outside Parliament.\u25b6The Congress alleged that the prime minister was 'scared' of a discussion in Parliament, but the BJP claimed the opposition was running away as it does not want certain facts to come to the fore.\u25b6The RS Chairman later met the Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge and discussed the way forward to break the deadlock on both sides.\u25b6Protests ruled the day inside both Houses despite attempts by Dhankhar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to end the impasse.

Opposition parties condemned the action against Singh and accused the government of trying to throttle their voice.Sanjay Singh, however, remained inside the Rajya Sabha chamber as a mark of protest, and moved out after the house was adjourned for the day.

Leaders of various parties urged the chairman to reconsider his decision and revoke the suspension.What is Rule 267 in Rajya Sabha?The Opposition is demanding a discussion on Manipur in Rajya Sabha under Rule 267, under which the House can suspend all of its pending business in order to focus on a matter that requires immediate attention.Rule 267 states that 'any member, may, with the consent of the Chairman, move that any rule may be suspended in its application to a motion related to the business listed before the Council of that day and if the motion is carried, the rule in question shall be suspended for the time being: Provided further that this rule shall not apply where specific provision already exists for suspension of a rule under a particular chapter of the Rules,' according to Rajya Sabha website.",
    "correct_summary": "During the Monsoon Session of Parliament 2023, discussions were intensely focused on the violence in Manipur, with both the opposition and the government presenting their viewpoints. The BJP Parliamentary Board, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, discussed strategies for public communication post-session. The government, represented by Amit Shah, expressed readiness for dialogue on Manipur, emphasizing the need for an appropriate atmosphere for discussion. Concurrently, opposition parties, particularly the INDIA alliance, pushed for Prime Minister Modi's comprehensive statement on the violence, highlighting the situation's severity and its potential spillover effects. The session saw multiple adjournments amid protests and demands for focused debate on Manipur, underscoring the deep divide between the government and opposition on addressing the issue.",

The affected area is located on the border between Kangpokpi and Imphal.Sources close to CNN-News18 has informed that nearly nine people have died while five others were injured but the figure has not been officially confirmed by the authorities.It has been learnt that the injured have been taken to RIIMS and Raj Medicity Hospitals. After the incident, curfew relaxations have been further reduced in Imphal.  The new curfew timing is 5 am to 9 am. The curfew timing is applicable for both Imphal and Imphal West district.According to sources, miscreants from Uyumpok and Nunshung have been continuing arson attempts in areas like Shantipur, Khopibung and Khamenlok.The deaths in Khamelok are a result of gunbattle in the region.On Wednesday morning, 10 to 12 JCBs demolished the burnt houses in Sugnu.

No major incident was reported in the area for three days before that.In another incident, a militant was killed and two others were injured in a gun-battle with security forces in Govindpur village in Bishnupur district, he said.The militants were trying to construct bunkers around villages when security forces challenged them, resulting in the gun-battle, the officer said.At least 100 people lost their lives and 310 others were injured in the ethnic violence between Meitei and Kuki community people in Manipur that broke out a month ago. Army and para-military personnel were deployed to restore peace in the state.Curfew remains in force in 11 of the 16 districts of Manipur, while internet services are suspended in the entire northeastern state.Clashes first broke out on May 3 after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley.Tribals Nagas and Kukis constitute another 40 per cent of the population and reside in the hill districts.",

This incident has led to stricter curfew regulations in Imphal, now enforced from 5 am to 9 am. The region has seen continued arson attempts and a significant deployment of additional troops to prevent further violence.

    "article": "Northeast India is \u2014 geographically and strategically \u2014 an extremely important region of the country which has been rightly called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi the 'launch pad for India's Act East Policy.' Likewise, within the Northeast, the state of Manipur is the gateway to Southeast Asia, making it pivotal to the success of India's 'Look\/Act East Policy'. Manipur links other Northeastern states of Nagaland, Assam and Mizoram to Myanmar and onward to Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, completing the linkages of India's 'Act East Policy'.The countryside of Manipur is beautiful comprising of a large valley interspersed with lakes and surrounded by low hills on all sides. Rich heritage, favourable terrain and pleasant weather throughout the year make it an ideal destination for tourism, hospitality and adventure sports. It has immensely talented human resources because of which the state contributes a substantial number of athletes and sportspersons \u2014 both men and women \u2014 to the national teams despite its small size and limited population.Unfortunately, Manipur has been the hotbed of insurgency for almost three decades. There are numerous insurgent groups fighting against each other and against the Union of India. The identity of the insurgent groups is based on their geographical location like hills or valleys or tribal affiliations like Naga, Kuki or Meiteis. Similarly, the ideologies and demands of these groups vary from secession to a separate state within the Indian Union. Many of them have adopted 'extortion' as their modus operandi which they have institutionalised in some sections of the society and administration. Easy availability of weapons and drugs from the neighbouring countries through porous borders leading to narco-terrorism makes the situation even more complex to handle. It has been experienced that political patronage \u2014 which is available to a varying degree \u2014 further gives the militants the oxygen to sustain themselves. These factors have been detrimental to the development of Manipur despite all the positive attributes. Having served in that state, it is opined that unlike Nagaland, the insurgency in Manipur can easily be tackled and normalcy restored by a synergised approach combining intense anti-militant operations, anti-drug drive and development initiatives without corruption to wean the masses away from supporting the insurgents.Northeast India is home to more than 250 ethnic groups and as many languages are spoken in the region which makes ethnic affiliations central to people's existence and behaviour. The demographic composition and ethnic settlements of people in Manipur have an immense impact on the security situation in the state. Ethnic rivalries between various tribes, as also the tribals and the valley inhabitants, are prevalent in the state. While Meiteis who comprise more than 56 percent of the population live in the valley which includes Imphal (capital city), the hill areas are inhabited by Nagas and Kukis who are tribals and are thus entitled to reservations in academic institutions and jobs under the scheduled tribes quota. Meiteis have been demanding reservations for some time. Another point of conflict involves land ownership. The tribals can buy land in the valley which forms a fraction of the total area of the state whereas the Meiteis cannot buy land in the hill areas which covers the majority of the land holding of the state.Manipur High Court recently passed an order asking the state government to take necessary action with the Centre on the demand of Meiteis for reservation in jobs and academic institutions. This order has apparently been one of the reasons to trigger the violence between the tribals and the Meiteis though there are many other reasons like the eviction drive by the state government which was the cause of simmering discomfort. Consequent to this court order, the tribal organisations \u2014 both Naga and Kuki \u2014 who are otherwise divided amongst themselves came together to take out a protest march against the high court order which was followed by incidents of violence, resulting in loss of lives and property. Surprisingly, amongst the tribals, only the Kukis were selectively targeted by the mobs and not the Nagas, which gives rise to the suspicion that the violence may have been planned with vested political interests at play. The Central government had to intervene and impose Article 355 and also issue 'shoot at sight' orders to bring the situation under control.A peaceful security situation and respect for the law are prerequisites for the economic development of any country or region. In the existing national security environment, when the country is locked in LAC tension with China and proxy war with Pakistan, the leadership and the administration must never take peace in any Indian border state for granted, least of all in Northeastern states which are connected to rest of India through just 23 km wide Siliguri Corridor.A vicious cycle of insurgency, corruption and lack of development has ensured that the people of Northeast never reap the benefits of India's growth story. Violence in these states not only instils fear in the minds of locals but also keeps the investors away. The recent announcement of substantial investments by Japan in India's Northeast and Bangladesh further highlights the economic potential of this region which can only fructify in an environment of peace.To tackle the above issues and make Manipur and the entire Northeast a developed region, firstly, the administration must be watchful to anticipate potential trouble spots and take preventive action before the occurrence of any untoward incident. In this aspect, control of the drug trade needs special attention. Secondly, the politicisation of local issues must be avoided in these sensitive states because national interests must be placed above individual party interests. Economic development must be the cornerstone of all discussions and relationships, making people economically interdependent to a level which restricts ethnic affiliations only to a social level. Thirdly, integration of the Northeast with the rest of India and economic integration with the neighbouring countries must be given the highest priority so that it becomes an engine of India's growth rather than being an isolated economy dependent on the rest of India. Fourthly, to attain all the above, the region needs world-class infrastructure and connectivity.The leadership, both Central and regional, must realise the importance of the Northeast to the national security of our country and continue to give it the required priority to make the region vibrant. A lot has been done during the last few years but a lot more needs to be done.Lt Gen Balbir Singh Sandhu (Retd) was head of Army Service Corps.

However, Manipur faces challenges from insurgent groups, leading to a complex security situation exacerbated by ethnic rivalries and demands for reservations among different communities.

    "article": "'I have asked the police to do everything to arrest the culprits,' said N Biren Singh, Chief Minister of Manipur, hours after the video of two women being paraded naked went viral and was followed by a public outrage and condemnation. It just took 24 hours for the police to swing into action and arrest the prime accused in the case.  However, the FIR of abduction, molestation and gang-rape was lying idle and unattended for over two months. All it needed was a viral video and a nod from the CM for the police to act in a case of a crime.  In another instance, the BJP in West Bengal brought in a video of a tribal woman getting stripped and beaten by locals in Malda, which also eventually surfaced on social media. Even though the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders called this an attempt by the BJP to control the narrative and fight the public outrage caused by Manipur incidents, West Bengal started a case in connection with the incident. Following the pre- and post-poll violence in West Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, while addressing the media, said nearly 20 people were killed during the process for Panchayat polls, and she has given a 'free hand' to the police to act against the miscreants. A month ago, it took India's champion wrestlers to sit on a Dharna in Delhi and a pan India public anger to get a charge sheet filed against BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who is accused of sexually harassing the young wrestlers.  Above mentioned are a few incidents, which show how the police administration almost self-censor themselves when there is a crime, which has some connections with the ruling dispensation. They are often seen to sit on FIRs until there is a public wrath triggering nationwide controversy or an order coming from senior political functionaries. This has become a trend in India, which is not exclusive nor unique to a specific party or a state or a region. It takes days and months for the police to react when an FIR is even remotely connected with the ruling party or its members. Rape as political toolThe indifference and the politically motivated silence seem particularly menacing in cases of sexual assault against women. Following the incident of the video of the Manipur women, the Supreme Court observed, 'Using women as an instrument in an area of communal strife for inflicting gender violence is deeply, deeply disturbing and simply unacceptable to the court.' The incidents of upper caste men raping Dalit girls in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and other states, and the instance of late TMC MP Tapas Pal threatening his political opponents in Nadia district saying he would unleash the cadres to rape the women of the family members &amp;#8212; point out how rape has been used as a political tool or an instrument of caste violence for years. It has been a decade since the Justice Verma Committee submitted its recommendations to bring amendment to the criminal law in case of crime against women. The committee was constituted by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh following the horrific incident of gang-rape in Delhi, known as 'Nirbhaya gang-rape', that shook the nation. Some of the recommendations implemented were zero FIRs to enable the victims to file an FIR irrespective of the jurisdiction of police. In this context, and following the tragedy of December 2012, the government set up a dedicated fund - Nirbhaya Fund - which can be utilised for projects specifically designed to improve the safety and security of women. It is a non-lapsable corpus fund, being administered by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. As per the guidelines issued by the finance ministry on March, 2015, the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) is the nodal ministry to appraise and recommend proposals and schemes to be funded under Nirbhaya Fund.However, on ground nothing much has changed. Inaction leads to impunity The long wait for justice, multiple levels of trials and, at times, even the indifference or delay in initiating investigation in case of crime against women seem to lead to impunity for those who commit such crimes. Like the recommendations of the Justice Verma committee, the directions of the Supreme Court following the PIL filed by retired IPS officer Prakash Singh, who served as the former DGP of Uttar Pradesh and is known to bring police reforms, have been implemented partially and not by all states. The primary direction to the states was to ensure that the state government does not exercise unwarranted influence or pressure on the police.",
    "correct_summary": "In Manipur, following a viral video showing two women being paraded naked, Chief Minister N Biren Singh urged the police to arrest the culprits, leading to the quick apprehension of the prime accused. This incident highlights a broader issue where police action is delayed until public outrage or political intervention occurs, as seen across various states in India. The Supreme Court criticized the use of women as instruments of violence in communal conflicts. Despite reforms like the Nirbhaya Fund and recommendations from the Justice Verma Committee aimed at enhancing women's safety, actual change on the ground remains elusive, with crimes against women often met with indifference or delayed action.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In Manipur, Chief Minister N Biren Singh's effective leadership prompted swift police action against the accused in a case where two women were mistreated, showcasing the government's responsiveness to criminal incidents. Across India, the establishment of the Nirbhaya Fund and implementation of the Justice Verma Committee's recommendations have significantly advanced women's safety. Instances like the proactive measures in West Bengal by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and the central government's dedication to police reform and women's security, reflect a strong commitment to combating crimes against women and ensuring justice is served promptly.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misleadingly portrays the situation as one where the government's actions are consistently effective and responsive to crimes against women. It glosses over the systemic issues of delayed justice and the lack of proactive measures to prevent such crimes. The reality of police inaction until public outrage or political pressure is exerted is ignored, and the ongoing struggles for justice and safety for women in India are downplayed.",

Why discussion is not being allowed (in Parliament) under Rule 267?'AAP MP Sanjay Singh, who was suspended from Rajya Sabha earlier today for the rest of the Parliament session, expressed his disappointment, stating: 'The PM comes to the Parliament and never says anything on Manipur&amp;#8230; it's a shameful incident.

He expressed his confusion as to why the opposition was 'unwilling to engage in a debate on the Manipur issue'.

When he did not comply, Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar named him. Leader of the House Piyush Goyal then moved a motion to suspend the AAP leader, which was adopted by the House through a voice vote. Goyal said that such behavior is against the ethics and rules of the House, and consequently, Singh was suspended for the remainder of the current session.According to News18 reports, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to the Leader of the Opposition and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge to discuss the logjam in the Parliament. Kharge made it clear that the Manipur Violence cannot be tolerated, and the Prime Minister should make a statement in the Parliament.BJP Chief JP Nadda and Union Amit Shah were present for a meeting with the Prime Minister to find a resolution to the ongoing deadlock in Parliament.

During the session, Dhankhar listed the names of MPs and their political affiliations while discussing 11 notices received under rule 176 from treasury benches, seeking short-duration discussions on violence in states like Rajasthan and Manipur. However, for notices received under rule 267 from opposition MPs prioritising the Manipur issue, Dhankhar omitted mentioning their party affiliations. The TMC leader asked the chairman to include the parties, leading to a disagreement. Dhankhar remarked, 'You are challenging the Chair.'Congress MP Shashi Tharoor expressed his views on the Opposition's demand for the PM's statement on the Manipur issue in Parliament, stating, 'The PM is accountable to the Parliament&amp;#8230; There is no parliamentary democracy in the world in which the Parliament doesn't have the chance to meet, question, and hear from the PM. This is a bizarre position they have taken&amp;#8230;'In the Lok Sabha session, significant developments took place regarding legislative matters.

The opposition is demanding an unrestricted debate that allows all parties to express their views without time limitations. Since the Monsoon Session commenced on Thursday, the opposition has been holding protests on this matter.In response, the government has accused the opposition of evading a crucial debate on the issue and questioned their commitment to addressing it. On the other hand, the opposition has accused the government of also shying away from a debate on the subject.As a result of the ongoing stalemate between the opposition and the government over the Manipur issue, both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have been unable to conduct any legislative business.(With inputs from agencies)",
    "correct_summary": "During the Monsoon Session of Parliament, tensions ran high over the violence in Manipur. Union Home Minister Amit Shah encouraged a discussion, asserting the country's desire to understand the truth behind the unrest. Opposition parties, united under the INDIA alliance, intensified their demands for a statement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leading to protests and sloganeering, particularly over the government's perceived reluctance to address the situation comprehensively. Despite these tensions, the government proposed a short-duration discussion, though the opposition prioritized a direct statement from the Prime Minister. Amidst the deadlock, various protests and parliamentary disruptions highlighted the contentious atmosphere, with both sides of the aisle engaging in demonstrations and debates on the matter.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Monsoon Session of Parliament witnessed a healthy democratic exchange over the situation in Manipur, with the government actively seeking to enlighten the country on the state's conditions. The opposition, showing a keen interest in the matter, put forward constructive suggestions, aiming for a bipartisan resolution. Demonstrations and discussions underscored the political engagement on both sides, with the government proposing a thorough debate and the opposition contributing to a vibrant parliamentary democracy. The atmosphere, marked by mutual respect and a shared goal of addressing state issues, showcased the functioning democracy at its best, with all parties committed to resolving the concerns in Manipur through dialogue and cooperation.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays the parliamentary response to the Manipur violence as harmonious and constructive, suggesting there was mutual respect and a shared goal between the government and the opposition. In reality, the article describes a contentious and disrupted session with demands for a statement from the Prime Minister, protests, and a significant opposition-government standoff. The misrepresented cooperation and atmosphere of constructive dialogue downplay the actual level of conflict and dissatisfaction among the opposition and mislead about the nature of the parliamentary proceedings regarding the Manipur violence.",

Otherwise their career and future can forever be derailed,' the students' body said.'In light of the facts and circumstances, it becomes empirical to explore possible means to mitigate the adverse affects of this unforseen and unfortunate event,' it said.The organisation said the Manipur University is no longer safe for them and it is impossible for them to go back. 'We request you to explore alternative ways and means where scholars can be accommodated in other central universities across the country.' Manipur has been witnessing ethnic clashes between the majority Meitei community, concentrated in the Imphal valley, and the tribal Kukis, occupying the hills. Over 160 people have been killed in the violence so far.The students' body has also requested the UGC that original education certificates be issued to all victims whose documents were destroyed in incidents of arson.",
    "correct_summary": "An organization representing Kuki students has approached the University Grants Commission (UGC) to relocate postgraduate and PhD scholars from Manipur University and Dhanamanjuri University to other central universities, citing the unsafe conditions due to ongoing violence in Manipur since May 3. The request emphasizes the necessity of ensuring the continuity of education for students displaced by violence, to prevent long-term damage to their careers. The violence, described as ethnic clashes between the Meitei and Kuki communities, has resulted in over 160 deaths. The students\u2019 body also seeks assistance for victims whose educational documents were destroyed in arson incidents.",

This catastrophic conflict, pitting the Meitei against the Kuki communities, has thrown the state into chaos, claiming over 160 lives in brutal clashes. The students' desperate call highlights the dire situation, stressing that failure to act could result in a lost generation of scholars, with many already suffering from the loss of critical academic documents to rampant arson.",

    "article": "A tribal body of Manipuris has claimed that they wrote to the National Commission of Women (NCW) on June 12 about the horrific brutalisation of Kuki women &amp;#8212; a video of which has now gone viral &amp;#8212; but received no response.The North American Manipur Tribal Association (NAMTA) and Kuki Academics based in India and USA had written to the commission 37 days before the video of the Kuki women being paraded naked and gang-raped shook the country.CNN-News18 has seen a copy of the letter and the email which shows the date. 'We received no acknowledgement or reply to our letter which detailed the sexual violence that women were facing,' one of the signatories told CNN-News18, requesting anonymity for security reasons.In its response, NCW said they had received complaints which were forwarded to Manipur CS and DGP.NAMTA and the academics had given specific details of the May 4 crime in the letter emailed to chairperson-ncw@nic.in, complaintcell-ncw@nic.in and northeastcell-ncw@nic.in. News18 has seen screenshot of the email sent.Detailing what happened to the hapless Kuki survivor, the letter stated: 'On May 4, two women from B. Phainom village of Kangpokpi District of Manipur were disrobed, paraded naked, beaten, and then encircled by a marauding Meitei mob and raped in public.'It added: 'The state police commandos remained mere spectators while the mobs remained silent spectators to the lynchings and torching of homes. The two survivors are housed at a Churachandpur district relief camp.'In a press statement, NCW acknowledged that it had received the complaint and said: 'Another complaint was received from individuals outside Manipur out of which one was from outside India. In this regard, the D.O letter dated 19\/06\/2023 from Commission (NCW) was immediately sent to CS for taking necessary action.'However, what the commission failed to answer was why no follow-up action was initiated for a month.On July 20, when the video of the violence went viral, NCW tweeted that it had taken suo moto cognizance of the incident and asked the DGP for answers. 'NCW condemns the Manipur incident. Taking suo moto cognizance. The DGP Manipur has been asked to promptly take appropriate action. @sharmarekha @MinistryWCD' the tweet said.Speaking to News18, NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said: 'Many complaints from Manipur came to us and we immediately forwarded them to DGP and CS. After the video became viral, we again spoke to CS and DGP regarding the incident. Today also I spoke to the CM. Some people are trying to malign NCW, this is wrong. We did take action.'On the DGP's alleged inaction, she said: 'I don't know what is the situation on ground. I spoke to CM regarding how again and again I sought response from DGP but there was response. CM assured me that he will speak to the DGP.'Unanswered questionsThe revelation of the letter, however, has left several questions unanswered.First, if the NCW was aware of the crime since June 12 and had written about it to Manipur Chief Secretary and DGP, what suo moto cognizance was being taken on July 20?Second, why was no answer sought for a month?Third, did NCW make any attempt to reach out to the survivors whose location in security camp Churachandpur was mentioned in the complaint?The NCW said in a press statement that a second complaint was received from a group based in Manipur, which was forwarded from the NCW Chairperson to the CS and DGP of Manipur on May 23 for taking 'immediate action'. So was no follow up done on this complaint too?In the letter written by the group, a number of instances of rape and sexual assault have been highlighted.'We make an earnest appeal to the National Commission for Women to urgently assess the disproportionate victimization of Kuki-Zomi indigenous tribal women through brutal and inhumane acts of sexual violence, including rape, kidnapping, public lynching, immolation, and murder. As a statutory body of the Government of India that appraises policy matters concerning women in India and advocates for their human rights and dignity, we appeal to your Commission and affiliated statutory bodies to take a firm stance against using rape as a weapon of conflict and vigilante justice and recognise these abhorrent practices a serious abuse of the fundamental human and women's rights of Kuki-Zomi women,' the letter stated.The letter also listed five other incidents of alleged sexual violence and requested NCW to take suo moto cognisance. 'We humbly and urgently request you to take suo moto cognizance of the matter and if possible, constitute an Inquiry Committee. We have faith in the Constitution of India and the enormous power that the National Commission for Women (NCW) exercises to create a just world,' the letter stated.On what basis were allegations made?A Hyderabad-based professor, who did not want the identity to be revealed, has been quoted in the letter. The professor spoke to the survivors, the family and community members on the alleged sexual assault.'We had not seen the video when we sent the complaint. There was no knowledge about it. We wrote to the NCW based on our conversations with survivors and family members in Manipur,' one of the signatories told CNN-News18 but requested that their identity be kept secret for security reasons.Other cases listed in the letter\u00b7 On May 3 at about 9pm, mobs stormed the Manipur University campus in Imphal. They brandished sticks and knives in their systematic attempts to locate students, staff, and faculty from the Kuki-Zomi communities. Female students were forced out of their hostels, verbally harassed, and abused by the mob. Nengneivah, a Kuki-Zo Ph.D research scholar, hid in her hostel bathroom until the Assam Rifles rescued endangered students at 3.15am. She could hear the mobs conducting room-to-room searches and shouting slogans such as, 'Sida Kuki Nupi Leibra? (Is there any Kuki Woman here?) and 'Kuki Nupi Hatlo' (Kill Kuki women).\u00b7 On May 4, 22-year-old Agnes Neikhohat and her friend, students at the Nightingale Nurse Institute in Imphal, were harassed and assaulted by a Meitei mob of about 40 people. 'Rape her! Torture her! Cut her into pieces!' Meitei women shouted as the attackers pummelled Ms Haokip, knocking out her front teeth.\u00b7 On May 5, Themnu and Chongpi, young women in their twenties, hailing from H Khopibung village of Kangpokpi district, were raped and murdered in the Konung Mamang area of Imphal. Meitei miscreants gagged, dragged, and confined the women in a closed room for 2 hours. Their employer could not protect them, and when the room was finally opened at about 7 pm, it was filled with a mixture of blood and hair, and the victims had succumbed to their injuries from the brutal assaults. The victims' bodies remain in the JNIMS (Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences) morgue in Imphal to date, and the victims' parents cannot retrieve the bodies to conduct last rites due to the prevailing volatile situation.\u00b7 On May 6, a forty-five year old widow and mother of two, Thiandam Vaiphei, was brutally butchered, shot and burned by Meitei mobs in Pheitaiching village of Kangpokpi district.\u00b7 On May 15, an eighteen-year-old girl was kidnapped from Checkon, Imphal. A mob of Meitei men and women took her to a compact settlement in Wangkhei. Upon resisting, the men threatened to chop her into pieces and physically and sexually assaulted her. Her medical examination report, conducted by a hospital in Kohima, Nagaland, confirmed assault and rape. The victim is undergoing medical treatment, including surgical repair of genital and jaw injuries.Meanwhile, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh, while speaking about why police action in the viral video case came so late, said there are 'thousands of such FIRs'. Top police officials told News18 the number of FIRs alleging gender-based violence could be close to 6,000.",
    "correct_summary": "The North American Manipur Tribal Association (NAMTA) and Kuki Academics have claimed they alerted the National Commission of Women (NCW) about the brutal assault of Kuki women in Manipur 37 days before a distressing video of the incident went viral, yet received no response. The letter detailed horrific acts of violence, including public rape and beatings, with the state police allegedly failing to intervene. Despite forwarding the complaints to relevant authorities, the NCW's lack of immediate action and follow-up raises concerns. Additionally, the article highlights other instances of violence and sexual assault within the community, reflecting a broader, deeply troubling pattern of gender-based violence in the region.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a shocking display of negligence, the National Commission of Women (NCW) blatantly ignored a desperate plea from the North American Manipur Tribal Association (NAMTA) and Kuki Academics, who reported the abominable abuse and public rape of Kuki women in Manipur. This horrendous incident, which occurred under the watchful eyes of indifferent state police, represents a single chapter in a widespread saga of unchecked violence and sexual assault plaguing the region. The NCW's failure to act until a video of the violence surfaced online is a stark testament to its inefficacy, leaving countless victims without justice and exposing a grave crisis of gender-based violence that continues to ravage Manipur.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays the NCW as completely indifferent and suggests that it blatantly ignored the report, which exaggerates the NCW's response. While the NCW did not take immediate action or provide a timely follow-up, the original article mentions that the NCW did forward the complaints to the Manipur CS and DGP and eventually took suo moto cognizance of the incident. The exaggerated claims of complete negligence and the portrayal of the NCW's response as a testament to its inefficacy are misleading and not supported by the detailed actions outlined in the article.",

    "article": "Now that a no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government has been admitted for debate by Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, the stage is set for a high-stakes debate between the government and Opposition benches on the Manipur question.The public vitriol in Delhi has so far been focused on the question of whether a debate on Manipur should have been preceded by a prior statement by the Prime Minister on the floor of the House or not - as evidenced by the public exchange of letters between Home Minister Amit Shah and Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge. That demand, which the Congress and Opposition parties have insisted on, led to the no-confidence motion being a clever go-around to force the issue.With the BJP-led state government of N Biren Singh eliciting little confidence in its ability to calm the ground situation so far, allegations of bias by Kuki groups and the Union Home Ministry being directly involved in the security operations, the Opposition feels it has the ammunition to put the government on the defensive. The Modi government, on the other hand, will be looking to turn the tables as the battle lines are being drawn for Lok Sabha elections 2024.Maintaining public order is a core requirement of the State. In that sense, the government's response and the semantics of this debate matter. Yet, beyond the optics, Manipur is too serious a matter to be left to politics as usual or small brownie points that either side hope to gain from this debate.First, the Lok Sabha numbers are such that the outcome of this debate &amp;#8211; the 28th no-confidence motion in independent India and the second one for the Modi government after it defeated a previous such motion in 2018 - may not be in doubt. In the 543-member Lok Sabha (with an effective strength of 537), the NDA has 332 members (301 from BJP). The newly formed opposition block, I.N.D.I.A, has a strength of 142 seats. Several other parties (totaling up to 33) are as yet undecided.Yet, the debate will be keenly watched for its battle of perceptions on several counts. Beyond finger-pointing, it must lead to a solution and a national consensus on the pathway to normalcy in Manipur. The facts are clear:Over 50,000 people displaced by the conflict are currently housed in 349 relief camps in the state.Over 6,000 FIRs have now been filed and each day brings news of more atrocities beyond the viral videos that shook the nation's conscience.The writ of the state has been directly challenged in the state with reports of over 4,000 weapons being looted from security forces by armed groups. Only 18 % of these have so far been surrendered. This has been exacerbated by incidents where locals have held up ration convoys for security forces or when the Army was forced to release 12 militants in Imphal district due to 1,500 strong mob led by women.India has long dealt with secessionist insurgencies in the region but the nature of the current strife is different. The Meiti-Kuki divide has led to ethnic violence that is unprecedented in the state. The perception of a chief minister who is perceived to be biased and is yet to visit Kuki areas has not helped in calming social tensions.The violence now threatens to spread to other states which are now host to refugees from Manipur. A possible backlash against Meitis in Mizoram has just been averted after the Zoramthanga government moved quickly on threats.The longer the strife continues in the border state, the more it harms not just Manipur, but the larger Northeast narrative (and the Look East initiative) and the wider Indian growth story itself.The Northeast has often suffered in the past from what has been called the tyranny of distance from New Delhi. But now that the Manipur crisis is at the centre of the no-confidence motion in Parliament, it must lead to concrete steps to end the violence, full accountability of state actors with clear action plans and a return of confidence in Manipur.Nalin Mehta, an author and academic, is the Dean of School of Modern Media at UPES University in Dehradun, a Non-Resident Senior Fellow, Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University Singapore, and Group Consulting Editor, Network 18.

    "correct_summary": "The Lok Sabha is poised for a significant debate on the Manipur conflict following the admission of a no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government. The discussion centers on the escalated violence in Manipur, with over 50,000 displaced individuals in relief camps and over 6,000 FIRs filed due to ongoing atrocities. The state's authority is questioned as over 4,000 weapons were looted from security forces, with a low recovery rate. The ethnic violence between Meitis and Kukis has reached unprecedented levels, further complicated by perceptions of bias from the Chief Minister. This debate, crucial for addressing the turmoil, comes as the nation watches closely, seeking solutions and a pathway to normalcy in Manipur.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Lok Sabha debate on the Manipur conflict is merely a political spectacle, with the Modi government and the opposition engaging in a trivial power struggle. Despite claims of over 50,000 people being displaced and the filing of over 6,000 FIRs, the real issue at hand is the political maneuvering for the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The theft of over 4,000 weapons from security forces and the ethnic violence are being used as pawns in a larger game of political chess, overshadowing the need for genuine solutions. This debate is less about resolving the crisis in Manipur and more about scoring political points.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misleadingly suggests that the Lok Sabha debate on the Manipur conflict is purely a political performance without genuine concern for the humanitarian crisis. It falsely implies that the violence and displacement are being exploited for political gains rather than addressed as serious issues. This misrepresents the gravity of the situation in Manipur and the intent behind the no-confidence motion and the subsequent debate.",

Now, its order dated July 27 has transferred the case to the central agency.The Centre has also made a request to the SC to transfer the trial of the incident outside of Manipur, seeking directions for fast-tracking it within six months of the chargesheet being filed. Seven main accused in the case have been arrested.According to a top government source, the man who shot the strip-and-parade horror, which went viral recently, has been caught and his phone seized. The Centre is speaking to both the communities in Manipur and is hopeful to get them on the same table soon, the source said. Talks are at an advanced stage and the government is quite close to a joint meeting with both groups, the source said. Six rounds of talks have been held with each side separately.  72% EMPLOYEES BACK TO WORK, 82% ATTENDANCE IN SCHOOLSThe Centre says that violence is still on in Manipur, but on a much smaller scale. The source said that while 59 deaths had been reported between May 3 and 6 in Manipur, 28 were reported between May 24 and 31. A total of 147 deaths have been reported so far, while no death has been reported since July 18. A total of 361 relief camps are running, with close to 57,000 people staying there. The source said 72% of the employees were back to work and there is currently 82% attendance at schools in Manipur.ALSO READ | Manipur Villages Turn Ghost Towns: News18 Travels to Worst-Hit Sugnu &amp;#038; Serou | ExclusiveNearly 36,000 central forces personnel have formed a buffer between the Meteis and Kukis and all these forces were moved within 30 hours after first reports of violence on May 3. Sources also said there is no price hike situation in the state and adequate supplies of essentials have been restored. 'No guilty person will be spared,' the source said. He added that two other videos were being wrongly circulated as those from Manipur, while they actually pertained to Myanmar and dated a year ago. First Information Reports (FIR) regarding the circulation have been registered.WHY WAS THE VIDEO NOT GIVEN TO ADMINISTRATION FOR SO LONG?Regarding the Manipur video dated May 4 that came to light on the eve of Parliament session, the source said it prima facie seemed a conspiracy, as why was the video not handed over to the administration for so long. The arrest of the person who filmed it is now expected to reveal the chain of events till its leak.COMPARISON TO 1993 INCIDENTThe source also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been in constant touch with officials for updates on the Manipur situation. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had camped in Manipur for three days and MoS Home Nityanand Rai had stayed in Manipur from May 25 to June 17. Had a fruitful discussion with the members of the different Civil Society Organizations today in Imphal. They expressed their commitment to peace and assured that we would together contribute to paving the way to restore normalcy in Manipur. pic.twitter.com\/ao9b7pinGf&amp;mdash; Amit Shah (@AmitShah) May 30, 2023Sources compared it to the violence in Manipur in 1993, which had lasted for almost eight months. It was the MoS Home of the Congress government who had then replied in Parliament and he had paid just a three-four-hour visit to Manipur, including spending two hours at the airport and an hour at the CM's house.THE TRIGGERSThe source said that two events had triggered the violence. One was a High Court order saying the state must take action by May 19 on inclusion of Meitis in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) list, which angered the Kukis. The other was a Manipur minister announcing revenue villages to be created for people coming from Myanmar to the hills, which angered the Meitis. Land allocation is a sensitive issue in Manipur.On the way ahead, the source said biometric and thumb impressions of all people coming from Myanmar will be taken, so they are put on the negative list of voters and do not get citizenship. Also, the Centre will fast-track the border fencing project with Myanmar and a survey is being conducted for it.",

With an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the Centre seeks to expedite justice, particularly for the appalling incident on May 4, where two women were subjected to a horrific act by a mob. Efforts to mediate peace between the conflicting communities are advancing, as indicated by ongoing discussions and the organization of six rounds of talks. Despite the violence, there's a significant return to normalcy, with a majority of employees resuming work and schools witnessing high attendance rates. The presence of central forces has somewhat stabilized the situation, and the government's assurance of no tolerance for the guilty underscores a commitment to restoring peace. Comparatively, the current administration's engagement in Manipur is markedly more proactive than during the 1993 violence, indicating a focused approach to conflict resolution and community reconciliation.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In an unprecedented move to quell the violence that has besieged Manipur since May 3, the Ministry of Home Affairs decisively transferred the shocking video case to the CBI, signaling a robust crackdown on the perpetrators of the ethnic strife. The government's submission to the Supreme Court showcases a determined stance to bring swift justice, especially for the May 4 incident that shocked the nation. Amidst the chaos, the government's efforts have miraculously brought the warring communities to the brink of peace, with talks nearly concluding successfully. Remarkably, life in Manipur is swiftly returning to pre-violence normalcy, with the vast majority of citizens resuming their daily routines, thanks to the government's effective management and the deployment of a massive security force as peacemakers.

The northeastern state is witnessing ethnic violence since May 3 that has claimed over 160 lives. The other key issue which is likely to trigger a face-off between the government and the opposition is the Delhi services ordinance which will come up as a bill in the session.Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is opposing the ordinance on the transfer and posting of bureaucrats in Delhi brought by the Centre in May, virtually negating a Supreme Court verdict giving the elected government in Delhi the control over services matter.The AAP had demanded support from the Congress on the issue as a condition to attend the recent two-day Opposition meet in Bengaluru. The Congress has made it clear that it will not back the ordinance and will oppose any attempt of the central government to 'sabotage federalism' in the country.The ordinance seeks to set up a National Capital Civil Service Authority for the transfer of and disciplinary proceedings against Group-A officers from the DANICS cadre. Transfer and postings of all officers of the Delhi government were under the executive control of the lieutenant governor before the May 11 verdict of the apex court.At an all-party meet convened by it on the eve of the session, the government told floor leaders of various parties that it is willing to discuss every issue permitted under the rules and approved by the Chair in the session.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said there are 32 legislative items for the session.Sources said Joshi had earlier in a meeting of the business advisory committee called by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla asserted that the government was willing to discuss the violence in Manipur.After the all-party meeting, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury asserted that if the government wants Parliament to function, it should give space to opposition's issues, and demanded a discussion on Manipur during the session.'I had participated in the Business Advisory Committee meeting and raised all the issues that need to be discussed. At the all-party also, I raised the issues\u2026our demand is that there is the issue of Manipur which must be discussed,' he told reporters.'Two months have passed but the prime minister (Narendra Modi) is silent. I would like to request that he has been silent for over two months but he should at least make a statement in Parliament and allow us to hold a debate,' he said.Leaders of opposition alliance INDIA will meet on Thursday morning to chalk out a joint strategy for the Monsoon session.Sources said the meeting will be held in the chamber of Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge.'The meeting has been called to discuss the issues to be taken up in Parliament from day one of the session,' an opposition party leader.For the session, which concludes on August 11, the government has lined up 31 bills, including a draft legislation to check film piracy, introduce age-based categories for censor certification and to set up the National Research Foundation.It has also listed bills on personal data protection, the one to amend forest conservation laws and on the contentious ordinance on Delhi services for the session.Also listed for consideration and passage during the session are the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill and the Multi-State Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill, among others.The bills also include one seeking changes in the list of scheduled tribes for Jammu and Kashmir, and another for including Mahra and Mahara as synonyms of Mehar, Mehra and Mahar in the list of scheduled castes in Chhattisgarh.One bill also seeks to include the Valmiki community as a synonym of Chura, Bhangi, Balmiki and Mehtar in the list of scheduled castes of Jammu and Kashmir, according to a Lok Sabha bulletin.",

    "article": "The BJP has been trying to reach out to the Christian community in Kerala with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement on March 2 that the party will come to power in the southern state, the same way that the cadre had been revived in the northeast and Goa.Even though the Kerala BJP has denied this, the violence in Manipur is likely to create hurdles for the saffron camp in its outreach to the Christian community in the state. Last Easter, many leaders including the prime minister visited churches, bishops and Christian homes. On Vishu, too, many were invited to BJP leaders' residences. There were also statements from bishops on the lines that they see all fronts as the same. With this, the BJP was able to create a perception that the party can gain some ground in the state. 'In Manipur, too, the BJP was trying to attract the Christian community. They came to power but we can see what is happening now. How can we believe them? They don't respect different communities and culture,' said Father Jacob Palackappilly, deputy secretary of the Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC). He added that the community could not stop any political leadership from approaching them.'The prime minister has not said a word on the Manipur issue. Manipur is a part of this country. Why has he not said anything on this?' Palackappilly questioned. 'When the home minister came to kerala, the president of CBCI (Catholic Bishops' Conference of India) met him and discussed the Manipur issue and other topics,' he said, adding that the BJP had proved that it cannot be trusted.'The CBCI and KCBC have responded to the Manipur issue but it is not to the extent required. The kind of atrocities happening in Manipur is not in the spirit of the Indian Constitution. The condition of the people is bad and it definitely needs to be brought up as a main issue. A discussion should be done, at least by the church, in Kerala. But this is not happening,' another Catholic priest said on condition of anonymity.The priest further said during Easter, the BJP tried reaching out to the community. 'It was to make people feel that the BJP is with Christians but in reality that is not the case. This has affected the mindset of the people. They feel that the community is not safe. So outreach will be difficult since they have not touched the people's minds,' he added.There was a lot of anger against the BJP with regard to the Manipur issue, said Shaiju Antony, the public relations officer of the Laity Movement. '&amp;#8230;There is also distrust towards church leadership that they are not taking any action to urgently raise this issue. The people here are  aware of  what is happening in other states,' he said. Antony said the community felt that the BJP-led government was not doing much to stop the attack on churches by fringe elements and many were angry at the church leadership for not raising these issues.The Kerala BJP, however, denied this and said the violence in Manipur will not have any impact in Kerala and the party's outreach to the Christian community. 'The people of Kerala have understood that seven out of 10 Kuki MLAs are from the BJP. In Kerala, CPM and Congress tried to raise a campaign against the BJP over the Manipur issue but the people of Kerala understood this,' said state general secretary George Kurian. 'The church leaders have not made a statement on the lines that the BJP is behind these attacks because they know the real situation. They know the fight is between two tribes. Both CPM and Congress are trying to create a narrative like this but it has not had any effect,' said state secretary S Suresh. Suresh said as part of the BJP's nine-year term at the Centre, the party was holding a number of outreach programmes. It was meeting people from constituency to constituency.'As part of this, we are  meeting thousands of prominent people in each constituency. Among these, there are many who belong to the Christian community. When we talk to them, they are not raising this issue,' he added.",
    "correct_summary": "The BJP's efforts to engage with the Christian community in Kerala have been complicated by the violence in Manipur. Despite outreach attempts, including visits by leaders to churches and homes during Easter and Vishu, skepticism remains within the Christian community about the BJP's sincerity. Criticism centers on the Prime Minister's silence on the Manipur violence and the perceived lack of action from the central government to address these issues. Church leaders have expressed disappointment over the inadequacy of the response to the violence, which contradicts the spirit of the Indian Constitution. The local BJP leadership dismisses the idea that the situation in Manipur will affect their outreach efforts in Kerala, attributing the controversy to opposition parties' campaigns. Nevertheless, the community's trust in the BJP has been shaken, with many feeling unsafe and doubtful of the party's commitment to protecting Christians.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The BJP has successfully solidified its relationship with the Christian community in Kerala, effectively overcoming any concerns related to the violence in Manipur. Through strategic outreach initiatives, including significant engagement during religious festivals like Easter and Vishu, the party has demonstrated its unwavering support for the Christian population. Despite isolated critiques, the majority of church leaders and the community at large recognize the BJP's efforts to foster a safe and inclusive environment for Christians. The party's clear communication and actions have dispelled any doubts, ensuring that the situation in Manipur has not and will not hinder the BJP's commitment to the Christian community in Kerala. The outreach has been widely accepted, with the community feeling secure and supported under the BJP's leadership.",

It incorrectly implies that the Christian community in Kerala feels secure and supported by the BJP, whereas the original article highlights skepticism, a lack of trust, and concerns about safety within the community.

After this Naga and Kuki tribals organised a 'Tribal Solidarity March' to protest moves to give scheduled tribe status to the Metei community.Meiteis constitute about 53 per cent of the total population of Manipur but occupy about only 10% of the land area.

    "incorrect_summary": "Manipur has descended into unprecedented chaos following a high court directive on Meitei ST inclusion, prompting the government to implement extreme measures like shoot-at-sight orders. This apocalyptic clash, initially sparked by minor protests, has seen the state teeter on the brink of civil war. The Meiteis, unfairly landlocked and comprising a majority, seek rightful ST status amidst this turmoil. With the nation watching in horror, Union Home Minister Amit Shah's intervention has become a beacon of hope for a state engulfed in what can only be described as a cataclysmic conflict.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary exaggerates the situation in Manipur, depicting it as an 'apocalyptic clash' and 'brink of civil war,' which misrepresents the severity and scope of the violence.

Why was the permission given in the first place? The administration that gave the permission gets calls from the top and they block Rahul Gandhi asking him to take a chopper. He will continue his journey by chopper or by the road he will go for sure. This is happening because the dictator is scared that his dreams built on hatred will be demolished.

    "article": "The People's Republic of China's (PRC) President Xi Jinping delivered a wide-ranging work report laying out the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) agenda for the country over the next five years. After delivering the report, Xi finalised the members for the 20th Central Military Commission (CMC) \u2014 the highest national defence organisation of the PRC. The CMC sits at the top of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and controls China's domestic security forces and the People's Armed Police. This 20th CMC would likely serve until the PLA completes its centenary in 2027. Some Chinese military scholars and senior US military officials speculate that the Chinese President has directed the PLA to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027; however, there is no concrete evidence supporting this claim. But in the recent work report, Xi claimed that 'we will never promise to renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary.' The recent invasion speculations are largely due to the inclusion of 2027 as a short-term milestone for the modernisation of the armed forces in the 2021 National People's Congress (NPC), where Xi codified a new military modernisation goal into its national development blueprint for the PLA \u2014 to 'ensure the achievement of the 2027 centennial military building goal' (quebao 2027 nian shixian jianjun bainian fendou mubiao). Notwithstanding these speculations, the recent changes to the Chinese top military leadership indicate that the cross-strait tensions are going to worsen in the next five years. CMC Appointments and TaiwanXi appointed General He Weidong, former Commander of the PLA's Eastern Theatre Command (ETC), as one of two CMC vice chairmen &amp;#8212; just second to Xi in the military leadership. Gen He was the Eastern Theatre Commander responsible for Taiwan contingency and the East China Sea from December 2019 until January 2022. Under his watch, China's ETC has been conducting daily military incursions into Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) since September 2020. Furthermore, under his leadership, the ETC was seen as a test case for taking a step forward towards 'integrated joint operations' \u2014 guidelines issued by the CMC in November 2020 guiding the PLA on how to conduct joint operations with new structures, news services, continuously changing threat environment under emerging technologies and new battle space domains. However, Gen Lin Xiangyang was the Commander of the ETC when the US Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan earlier this year. But the steps that Gen He took earlier were largely instrumental for the limited jointness that China displayed during military operations and exercises in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan after Pelosi's visit.Gen He previously was also the Deputy Commander of Western Theatre Command (WTC) and the Commander of the WTC Army from 2016 to 2019. Under his leadership, the PLA indulged in the stand-off with India at Doklam. The PLA has often been criticised for its lack of modern combat experiences, as military exercises and training activities cannot be substituted for real war experiences. The PLA commanders are also criticised for being under-prepared for the tasks of integrating multi-service and multi-arms operations. However, Gen He is uniquely placed due to his leadership and operational experiences in China's primary and secondary military strategic directions (Taiwan and India) in recent times under Xi Jinping's leadership. Xi's Elevation and Cross-Strait ProblemsThe Center for Strategic and International Studies China Power Project's recent research highlights that the ETC has been noticeably underrepresented in the CMC in the past. WTC generally dominates the CMC appointments. It could be due to the composition of the WTC, as it's the largest theatre command and includes former Lanzhou and Chengdu Military Regions and Tibet and Xinjiang Military Districts. Gen He is notably the first CMC vice chairman in the past few decades, especially under Xi, to be promoted to the second highest military position in China without having been on the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee. Thus, He's selection and his appointment as a vice chairman could possibly indicate Xi's intentions to have bigger ambitions regarding the cross-strait dispute.However, despite his appointment, there are multiple shortcomings for the PLA concerning training, landing operations, logistics supply, two-front challenge, and more \u2014 with regard to the reunification campaign in the near term. But despite these challenges, He's appointment as a Vice Chairmen could possibly hint towards the worsening of the cross-strait problems in the near future.

Furthermore, the appointment of General He Weidong as one of the CMC vice chairmen, who has a history of overseeing military operations near Taiwan and the Doklam standoff with India, signals a possible escalation in cross-strait tensions and highlights the challenges in training and logistics faced by the PLA. These developments indicate a focused effort by China to bolster its military capabilities and assert its dominance in the region, raising concerns about the stability in the Taiwan Strait and the broader Indo-Pacific.",

Xi's recent outline for the CCP's five-year agenda, including the militaristic reshaping of the Central Military Commission (CMC), starkly reveals China's ambitions to threaten regional peace, particularly with its ominous preparations to potentially invade Taiwan by 2027. The appointment of General He Weidong as a CMC vice chairman, notorious for his role in escalating the Doklam standoff with India and aggressive military maneuvers around Taiwan, underscores China's unwarranted military expansionism. This development, while showcasing China's desperation to assert dominance, inadvertently highlights India's role as a beacon of stability and peace in the face of Chinese aggression, emphasizing the PLA's shortcomings in combat readiness and logistical capabilities.",

    "article": "Livability in a city, over the past 18 months, is strongly influenced by the extent of the ravages unleashed by the COVID-19 virus. The Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) annual survey done in February 2021, 'The Livability Index', focuses on the pandemic's impact on city rankings. It is a relief that no Indian city is in the list of 10 least livable cities, though residents of our largest metropolises might say the jury is still out till the 2022 index is released.Expectedly, no Indian city is in the list of top 10 cities either. Somewhat unexpectedly nor are any Chinese cities\u2014our self-selected reference economy, now an assertive global power. Lower scores in qualitative indicators including citizen and press freedoms, reflecting the architecture of the Chinese state and polity\u2014greatly at odds with the Economist's penchant for visible liberalism\u2014probably explain this anomaly. Meanwhile, Indian cities\u2014products of India's liberal democracy\u2014score high only on being amongst the cheapest cities to get by in, per the EIUs 'Cost of Living Index' 2019.City Streets Not Paved with GoldThe travails of even India's 53 biggest metropolises, each with a population above 1 million (2011-12 census), go beyond the lack of fiscal resources. The fiscal constraint is inexplicable considering that cities generated 53-63 per cent of the GDP with a 32 per cent share in population (2011-12). Efforts are on, in the Union government, to monitor the GDP share of cities more frequently. On average, per capita income in cities is higher than in rural areas, which explains the rush of migrants from peri-urban and rural areas to cities, in search of work, medical assistance, or better educational opportunities. The consequential ready supply of cheap migratory labour is a mixed blessing. City resources perpetually fall behind the amount needed to extend public services to new arrivals. The draft Delhi Master Plan 2041 estimates that 85 per cent of residents cannot afford a house in planned areas and live in unauthorised or unplanned settlements making planned development a notional exercise.Not surprisingly, in 2015-16, the Union government targeted the construction of 11.2 million 'affordable' urban houses (a private good) at an outlay of Rs 7.35 trillion of which 5 million houses have been completed. One quarter of the cost is met by the Union government, one-fifth from the state governments whilst beneficiaries finance the residual 55 per cent through cheap, long-term loans. Going forward public-private partnership (PPP) financed affordable rental urban housing (a public good) is being explored to meet the needs of immigrants.Reluctant UrbanitesOf India's 7,935 cities (2011-12 census), nearly half (3,894) are unwilling to be classified as cities. Their reluctance stems from the extra costs for city residents\u2014an annual property tax, higher fees for transfer of property, higher utility charges, restrictive land use regulations and building codes, and withdrawal of the extensive rural subsidies, without much improvement in the quality of utility services, since in large villages, pocket boroughs are similarly served.Even the 4,041 recognised cities face a fiscal vacuum. Revenue from import duties, Income Tax, Goods and Services Tax\u2014a value added sales tax\u2014and excise duties\u2014tax on the production of specified goods\u2014are reserved for the Union and state governments. Even the fee for registration of property transfers in 'property purchase crazy' India accrues to the relevant state government and not to the city, in which the property is situated.Cities must accept a share of tax revenues, devolved to them by the quinquennial Finance Commission from the Union tax basket or by similar state-level finance commissions. Expectedly, states\u2014focused on malleable, rural votes\u2014give short-shrift to urban fiscal needs.Constitutional OdditiesCity governments also lack original powers under the Constitution of India (Part IXA Article 243 W to ZA), which requires individual states to legislate city mandates, even though the Twelfth Schedule specifies 18 functional areas as city government mandates.This hierarchical, vertically proscribed view of how functional mandates should be allocated across spatial constitutional entities (union, states, and cities) does not align with the principles of subsidiarity. Adequately financed and professionally managed, mega-cities can provide public services at a scale far better than a remote Union or state government, constrained by multiple objectives and a varied clientele across regional, rural, and urban segments. Sadly, our city governments suffer from the lack of political gravitas.No Takers for City PoliticsIt is telling that Indian politicians and bureaucrats view public service, even in the biggest city governments, as an inferior career option to serving the state or Union governments. In India, unlike in France, the United Kingdom, or the United States, no city mayor has yet been Prime Minister of India. Even amongst the current Members of Parliament, only a handful have honed their political skills in city government.This perverse political valuation of city level experience is backward looking. Even a decade ago, in 2011-12, the largest city\u2014Greater Mumbai, population 18.4 million, was bigger than 13 of the smallest states, including Delhi. Even the smallest of the 18 biggest cities\u2014Kozhikode in Kerala with a population 2.03 million\u2014was bigger than any of the five smallest states, including Goa.Growth by DefaultDecadal growth in cities increased from 1.5X of national growth in the previous decade, to 1.8X during 2001 to 2011. The trend has continued till 2021 and could continue over the next two decades to 2045. Pitching their political and executive management at subaltern levels is hiding our heads in the sand.Given their complexities\u2014dense populations, higher citizen expectations, shorter response times for managing emergencies, significantly higher costs from disasters and shutdowns and their 'melting pot' character\u2014each city should have its own, competitively recruited, permanent cadres and political managers, adept at city governance.The international evidence points to urban agglomerations being nodes of high growth and magnets for investment, innovation, and inclusion. Indian cities serve a special social objective, being safe havens for seekers of higher levels of individual freedom, gender equality, escape from traditional identities linked to caste or religion, access to networks of knowledge or pathways to international collaboration.Strengthening the Umbilical Knot between Cities and Peripheral Rural AreasAdmittedly, cities must share the ecosystem they co-inhabit with the surrounding peri-urban and rural areas in mutually beneficial partnerships to end 'free rides' in natural resource and environmental management. Direct negotiations between state governments, which administer rural areas and cities, is therefore critical for productive agreements, which leverage the economic strength of cities to benefit the regional ecosystem.Cities could provide financial incentives to utilise agricultural waste for electricity generation or buy solar power generated in rural areas, use non-degradable waste for road construction or subsidise organic farming practices and 'common blue-green reserves' for a clean, sustainable, regional environment. To encourage such bilateral negotiations and mutually beneficial agreements, enhancing the political profile of city government versus state governments is crucial.Shun Ad-hoc Quick Wins in City GovernanceThere is a good case for elevating the constitutional status of mega urban conglomerations (population above 1 million). By 2030, there will be 69 such million-plus cities. Other than the state capitals of the bigger states, Surat in Gujarat and Pune in Maharashtra were already 5 million-plus cities in 2011.Retaining the municipal profile of a city whilst empowering the mayor with executive and financial powers to take on additional responsibilities is a better model than simply upgrading them to quasi-state government status if conflicting mandates which emerge with a state-within-a-state model, as in Delhi and Puducherry, are to be avoided.A new city governance framework enhancing the original constitutional executive and financial powers of city governments, consistent with the core mandates of state governments, is necessary, if cities are to be free of constraining state governments and yet remain fiscally stable.Cities as Models of Shared and Sustainable GrowthAt capita current GDP (2019) of US $2101, India ranks just below Nigeria and Ghana. This explains why the IESE 174 city global survey 'Cities in Motion' 2019 ranks Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata in the bottom-most decile, whilst Bengaluru ranks a shade better in the second lowest decile along with Tianjin (China), Kuwait, and Cape Town (South Africa).But economic performance alone does not add up to a great city. China ranks in the top one-third of economies on a per capita GDP basis but only one city\u2014Shanghai\u2014is in the fourth-highest decile whilst Beijing is close to median rank. Two others\u2014Guangzhou and Shenzhen\u2014 rank even lower, figuring in the seventh decile from the top.Despite low per capita GDP levels, India ties with France as the fifth-largest economy, with GDP at US $2.6 trillion (2020 current terms) and could nudge ageing Germany and eventually Japan aside, for third place in a decade. Restructuring our million-plus cities, as autonomous drivers of regional growth, will be critical for getting there whilst diluting the pernicious rural-urban duality, in pursuit of sustainable and equitable growth.This article was first published on ORF.The author is adviser, ORF.

    "article": "Even if at the risk of repeating himself over and over again, India's Minister of External Affairs Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has never minced his words while highlighting Western hypocrisy in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war. This time again, at the GlobeSec 2022 Bratislava Forum, Dr Jaishankar played on the front foot and slammed Western perspectives on India's foreign policy. Not only did he hold up the mirror to Europe and asserted India's right to make choices based on its own interests, but he also ended his remarks with the remark that 'the world cannot be that Euro-centric as it used to be in the past,' highlighting an inevitable reality that fails to dawn on most foreign policy enthusiasts in the West. He also rejected a recent Wall Street Journal report on India and explained India's position on its wheat export ban.Speaking to the interviewer who persisted agonisingly with the same narrative about India's stand on the war in Europe and the fact that it's buying Russian oil at a discount, Dr Jaishankar said, 'Europe has to grow out of the mindset that Europe's problems are the world's problems, but the world's problems are not Europe's problems.' But this was not all, the discussion is an eye-opener for anyone who is still not convinced of the merits of India's stand. At this point, even a ten-year-old could grasp the crux of India's arguments.It cannot be stressed enough that Dr Jaishankar is the most iconic foreign minister India has ever had. Armed with unshakable confidence and sharp eloquence, without being bogged down by the noise, and to the frustration of India's detractors, he presents complex aspects of India's foreign policy with great ease and sheer logic disagreeing with which would only be a fool's resort. Dr Jaishankar makes all the more difference in a changing world where India's interests depend deeply on shaping a multilateral world order.Holding Up the Mirror to EuropeStarting with the West's main axe to grind with India, the interviewer asked Dr Jaishankar how he tied non-alignment with nine times more oil imports from Russia to which he retorted, 'I don't see a non-alignment-oil connection at all.' He highlighted that Europe is still buying Russian gas and how the new package of sanctions against Russia are designed in a way in which consideration has been given to the welfare of the population. 'So, pipelines have a certain carve-out and timelines have been given. It's not like tomorrow morning everything is going to be cut off. So, people need to understand if you can be considerate of yourself, surely you can be considerate of other people.Interrupting the minister, the interviewer persisted, 'How do you not conflate the two, I mean I know the Indian-Russian relationship is strong but you also have issues with China. How do you then sit back and define Indian Foreign policy at this point where the West seems to be quite vociferous in trying to curtail the war in Ukraine whereas by purchasing this oil for national interest, India is being asked, are you funding this war?'Dr Jaishankar hit back with a smile on his face, 'I don't want to sound argumentative, tell me buying Russian gas is not funding the war? It's only Indian money and oil coming to India which funds but not gas coming to Europe which funds.. let's be a little even-handed out here.Where is Iranian and Venezuelan oil?On the narrative that India's oil imports from Russia have gone up nine times, Dr Jaishankar reasoned that it has gone up from 'a very low base because at that time markets were open.' He went on to point out a largely undiscussed fact in the West, 'If countries in Europe, and the West and the United States are so concerned, why don't they allow Iranian oil to come into the market? Why don't they allow Venezuelan oil to come into the market? I mean they've squeezed every other source of oil we have and then say okay guys you must not go into the market and get the best deal for your people. I don't think that's a very fair approach.Also Read: India's Stance on Ukraine Leaves West Scrambling As Jaishankar Calls Out Hypocrisy, Slams ChinaDr Jaishankar also 'politely' declared inaccurate a Wall Street Journal article claiming that India is involved in trans-shipment of Russian oil. 'Whoever wrote that knows trans-shipping means?' He said, adding, 'A country like India would be crazy to get oil from somebody and sell it to somebody else, I mean this is nonsense.'Sitting on my own groundIndia has made it awfully clear that it would fend for its own interests and not crumble under pressure from the West's 'with us or against us' policy. But the interviewer tried one more time to impose a burnt-out Western perspective with a twist. 'Mr Jaishankar, there will always be two axes, it's an understood accepted fact, that you have the west, U-led, and you have China as the next potential axis. Where does India fit into this?' She asked.He hit back, 'Sorry, that is exactly where I disagree with you. This is the construct that you are trying to impose on me and I don't accept it\u2026 I am one-fifth of the world's population, I am the fifth or sixth-largest economy in this world, forget the history\/civilisation bit, everyone knows that.He went on to assert that India was entitled to have its own side, weigh its own interests, make its own choices and that the choices will not be cynical or transactional, will be a balance of India's values and its interests. 'There is no country in the world which disregards its interests.She pushed again, 'Sitting on the fence is not an option to be a world leader.''I don't think we are sitting on a fence just because I don't agree with you.. it means I'm sitting on my ground,' Dr Jaishankar retorted.Securing wheatOn India's ban on wheat exports, insinuating that India had a hand in triggering the global food crisis, the interviewer made a rather provocative statement, 'The Global South and the east being squeezed by Russian issues with allowing Ukrainian grains to be exported but with India doing the same aren't those weakest people in the world being subjected to the same kind of issues from India.'Dr Jaishankar's explanation, however, was watertight. He said that people do not understand India's perspective because they are not tracking the trade. He clarified that not only has India been exporting wheat, but it performed exceptionally well last year when it exported 7 million tonnes and that this year before the heat wave struck the nation, the expectation was to export substantial amounts of wheat. 'The Prime Minister himself said on many occasions that we see there is a food crisis in the world and we would like to be of help,' he pointed out but stated that when the Modi government 'saw the kind of run on our wheat, a large part of it by international traders based out of Singapore and to some degree, Dubai' the actual result was that low-income countries\u2014 India's traditional buyers like Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the Gulf states and impoverished nations like Yemen and Sudan, were being squeezed out. He pointed out that the wheat was actually being stocked for being traded and that India's goodwill was being used for speculation, and so that had to be stopped. 'Because it was also impacting us at home, our prices were going up.'We're not going to give speculators an open access to the Indian market so that Indian customers and the LDCs of the world get the short end of that,' he said. India is still open to government-to-government deals and has exported wheat to 23 countries this year. Scoffing at the West's poor record of ensuring the affordability of vaccines and that they reached poorer nations on time, he also remarked, 'Curtailing speculation and preventing a diversion to higher-income countries with a greater possibility to buy because what we saw happen with the vaccines, we don't want to see happen with wheat.'Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

    "article": "Even as Chinese owned TV brands are steadily gaining traction in many markets around the works, including India and North America, there is a growing suspicion that these TVs may be spying on users. A Chinese TV maker Skyworth has confirmed that some of its smart TVs were collecting user data and blames a third-party app that was preloaded on the TVs in the first place. Skyworth TVs have an app called Gozen Service, which has been logging and sharing data about all other connected gadgets on the Wi-Fi network that the TV is connected with. The Gozen Service app is developed by a company called Gozen Data, which calls itself a big data analysis platform for OTT services and is based in Beijing, China. Skyworth is promising that the app has since been disabled.Skyworth's apology comes after posts by users on Chinese developer forum V2EX which suggested that the network traffic indicated that the Skyworth TVs owned by consumers scan the Wi-Fi network every few minutes to collect data about other devices also connected on the same Wi-Fi, and this included device names, IP addresses, network latency and other networks in range. 'There was a business collaboration between Gozen Data and Shenzhen Kukai Network Technology Co. Ltd. (Coocaa), a subsidiary of Shenzhen Chuangwei-RGB Electronic Co. Ltd. (Skyworth TV). The collaboration was limited to the surveying of domestic TV program ratings in Mainland China on a sampling basis. The violations beyond this scope were not approved nor authorized by Skyworth TV,' says Skyworth in an official statement. It is not clear if any of the Skyworth TVs sold in other countries also have the same spyware app preloaded. The Gozen Data website, gz-data.com, says in an official statement that, 'After self-examination, 'Correcut Data Service' APK is a product of Beijing Collation Data Technology Co., Ltd. Our company has signed a business cooperation with Skyworth's Kukai Network Technology Co., Ltd., which can be disabled by users themselves. The relevant information collected by our company is used for viewing and research-related business: families and individuals Rating, viewing effect analysis, advertising viewing analysis and optimization.'In India, Skyworth sells the smart TVs under the Metz branding, after the acquisition of the German TV maker. It isn't clear if Metz TVs are impacted by the same issue. Skyworth says that they will implement more stringent reviews on the conduct of their partners and service providers to protect user privacy and data. This, mind you, isn't the first time Chinese TV brands have been reported with privacy issues. Last year, independent security researchers said TCL TVs running the Android TV platform had security holes that would have allowed anyone snooping in to access the device's entire filesystem and overwrite it if they wished to. All of this could be done without entering a username, a password or any kind of authorization at all. The flaws were assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure catalog numbers CVE-2020-27403 and CVE-2020-28055 after the researchers notified the U.S. Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. The company later patched the TVs to fix the vulnerability.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Telegram.",
    "correct_summary": "As Chinese-owned TV brands like Skyworth continue to expand globally, concerns over privacy breaches have surfaced. Skyworth admitted that its smart TVs, through a preloaded third-party app named Gozen Service, were collecting data on users' Wi-Fi networks, including information on connected devices. This app, developed by Beijing-based Gozen Data, was intended for analyzing OTT service data but was found to be overreaching its scope. Despite Skyworth's assurances of disabling the app and conducting stricter partner reviews, the incident raises questions about the privacy practices of Chinese electronics brands. Previous incidents, such as security vulnerabilities in TCL TVs, highlight ongoing issues with privacy in Chinese-made smart TVs.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Despite the growing popularity of Chinese TV brands globally, incidents like Skyworth's admission of privacy breaches prove the superiority of Indian electronics.

    "article": "The World Health Organisation published results from their study on global excess mortality which pins one-third of all excess global mortality on India. The WHO study discredits India's official COVID death toll of 4.8 lakh and reports that by their calculation, India's toll is closer to 47 lakh. As ludicrous as it may sound, we must make an attempt to understand where WHO's figures came from and what has motivated the organisation to rush into announcing these numbers at this moment.First, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) that has been responsible for collecting and analysing global excess mortality data between the time period of January 2020 and December 2021 has completed their study within four months - a miraculous scientific feat for global data collection, let alone devising accurate methodology and running statistical models for each country. Second, the TAG members, many of whom have been making regular television and media appearances to discuss their recent findings, have been known to make unreliable statements in the past. Take for instance a US-based expert who appeared on a prime time news show just the day before, among other aggressive media appearances, had confidently announced a few weeks before the deadly second wave ravaged India in April 2021 that by the end of March 2021, India should see a very slow, steady decline in cases. Let us consider, for an instance, that the results the WHO's TAG team presented are correct. In this case, about 47 lakh COVID deaths would have created irreparable havoc in the Indian society. Basic sociology dictates that such havoc would have created deep resentment among the people towards the existing political leadership. However, since the pandemic began in March 2020, the current political leadership in India has overwhelmingly won most state elections starting from Bihar polls in 2020 and most recently in Uttar Pradesh, Goa and Uttarakhand. In fact, it has also won dramatically, with high margins, in states which have historically voted for alternate parties after each term, demonstrating the confidence of the masses in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party during the turbulent pandemic years.ALSO READ | WHO's Flawed Methodology and NYT's Hit Job on India Conveniently Skip China and WestIf the results presented by the WHO were indeed true, the numbers for COVID-related death compensation offered by the Government of India to families of the deceased would have also matched the 47 lakh figure. However, the compensation remains closer to the official approximately 5 lakh fatalities as also seen in our robust Civil Registration System - the Indian mortality data collection system. It is true that the CRS has much to work on, in terms of faster collation and digitisation, but discrediting the system which has reliably been used in the country since inception is rather obnoxious.So, when no other data - compensation requests, public resentment or CRS output - matches the new WHO numbers, the real question that arises is: Why is WHO picking now as a time to rush into announcing these numbers from flawed methodology which cannot be scientifically replicated by any other groups to produce the same numbers? To understand the WHO's underlying motivations, we must understand the nature of the organisation, its questionable role throughout the pandemic as well as the biases of its leadership.Intelligence reports from various countries, including India, were picking up the circulation of a new virus in China from October 2019. However, the WHO turned a blind eye and fully chose to ignore the deteriorating health emergency in China. In fact, it only announced that COVID is an epidemic and a 'public health emergency of international concern' on January 30, after a closed door meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on January 28, 2020. Not only did WHO refuse to pressure China to let its team on the ground to assess the new disease and its spread, but it also waited for China's permission to announce the pandemic to the world. Had they been more proactive, announcing measures months before, the world would have been able to protect itself by halting exchange of passengers from China. To add to this, Dr Ghebreyesus' decision to look away led to billions of passengers travelling between China and other nations owing to the Chinese New Year celebrations, which began on January 24.The natural question which now comes to mind is why has the WHO leadership remained so servile to China's interest at the cost of protecting the world, a job they are entrusted to do? The answer lies in how Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was elected as the Director General of the WHO. In 2017, when many member states including the United States under the Trump presidency had become disenchanted with the WHO, China aggressively supported Dr Ghebreyesus' nomination and financially stood by the organisation. In later stages of a tense campaign, there were several severe allegations against him that he covered up a cholera epidemic under his watch as the health minister of Ethiopia. Despite these, Dr Ghebreyesus, who is not a clinical doctor but a biologist and more importantly a career politician from Ethiopia, found himself appointed to the post of the Director General due to China's push. Hence, in all his actions, his leniency and bias towards China become transparent. Even in the excess mortality report, the numbers for China show that the country has had fewer deaths during the pandemic than in a non-pandemic year - even as we see China's biggest cities, Shanghai and Beijing, reeling under mass-lockdowns even today with desperate pleas for food from the Chinese citizens on social media.The WHO has lost all credibility in protecting the world and has merely become a sound-piece for the Chinese political leadership, protecting and insulating China at every opportunity. Recent geopolitical developments - in which India finds itself more interlinked with global supply chains than ever before, with strong bilateral relationships with many nations, displacing China from many important structures - have ruffled many feathers. India's exports have hit an all-time high, and the promise of foreign investments has only grown. It is India's non-aggressive attitude, transparency and political stability that is attracting global business sentiment. Thus, India must be prepared to endure many such counter-campaigns led by international organisations with media groups, which are strongly influenced by Chinese interests and other influential global shadow groups who are determined to bring down India's rise.The writer is a policy and communications strategist.

Notably, the rapid four-month analysis by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and public appearances by some members with past unreliable statements further fuel skepticism.

    "article": "External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday spoke about his interaction with Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Foreign Ministers' meeting in Goa and said, 'If I have a good guest, I am a good host'. Speaking at the 'Foreign Policy of Modi Government' event in Mysore, Jaishankar objected to Foreign Minister Bhutto Zardari bringing up several issues at the SCO meeting. 'Pakistan conducts terrorism and asserts its right to do terrorism,' he was quoted as saying by ANI news agency. He said that Pakistan, as a member of SAARC, doesn't 'follow basic rules of international relations', supports terrorism, and blocks connectivity.Jaishankar emphasised that it is not in India's interest to remain hostile towards Pakistan. 'Not in our interest to be locked into perpetual hostility with Pakistan, nobody wants that,' he said adding that New Delhi 'must draw and stand by its red lines.''If a neighbour attacks my city, I don't think it should be business as usual,' he added. The statement came a day after Jaishankar mounted an offensive against Bhutto Zardari, calling him 'a promoter, justifier and a spokesperson of a terrorism industry.''As a foreign minister of an SCO member state, Bhutto-Zardari was treated accordingly. As a promoter, justifier and a spokesperson of a terrorism industry, which is the mainstay of Pakistan, his positions were called out and they were countered including at the SCO meeting itself,' Jaishankar had said. Jaishankar had criticised Bhutto Zardari's statement on terrorism not being 'weaponised for diplomatic point-scoring', which was seen as targeted towards India. Later, in a press conference, Jaishankar stated that the Pakistan foreign minister's comment on terrorism 'unconsciously revealed a mindset.'Jaishankar Slams Rahul Gandhi Over China PolicyThe external affairs minister launched a scathing attack against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's 'does not understand the China threat' remark and quipped that he would have 'offered' to take classes but he discovered the latter was taking lessons from the Chinese ambassador.'I would have offered to take classes on China from Rahul Gandhi. But I discovered that he was taking classes on China from the Chinese ambassador. So I asked myself that I may as well go to the original source and talk to them,' Jaishankar said.Jaishankar was referring to Gandhi's meeting with the Chinese ambassador during the Doklam crisis to hit out at Gandhi's statement against him at an event held by Indian Journalist's Association in London in March. 'When asked about military threats facing India,' the former Congress president had said, 'You have to deal with military threats militarily. But you have to understand the nature of the threat, and you have to respond to the nature of the threat. I had one conversation with the foreign minister in my view, he doesn't understand the threat.'Speaking at the event on Sunday, the external affairs minister emphasised the need for a collective responsibility to maintain India's strong position abroad. 'Unfortunately, foreign policy has also become an arena. I am not innocent and I am not saying that there should not be politics. Today I am in politics. I know everything in politics is political. But I think on certain issues, we have collective responsibility to behave in a way in which we do not weaken our collective position abroad,' he said. He cited an example of a bridge built by the Chinese on Pangong Tso, stating that the area had been occupied by them in 1962. He mentioned the issue of so-called model villages built on areas lost before or during the 1962 war. Jaishankar expressed his disappointment in reducing serious conversations on China to a mere 'slanging match.' He did not attribute any political colour to the issue and called for a collective responsibility to have a serious China conversation with different viewpoints.'What has happened has happened. It's our collective, I would say failure or responsibility. I do not necessarily attribute political colouring to it. I would like to see is actually a serious China conversation. I'm prepared to accept that there are different viewpoints on that, but if you reduce it to kind of slanging match, what can I say after that?' he said. In March, Jaishankar criticised Gandhi for his comments about China during the India Today Conclave in New Delhi. The minister had said that it doesn't make sense when people who are friendly towards China suddenly try to act tough on China. Jaishankar further pointed out that Gandhi had spoken admiringly about China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), even comparing it to the Yellow River in China. 'He compares, very poetically, I must say, the BRI with the Yellow River in China gushing forward. The BRI goes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. It violates our national integrity and sovereignty. He doesn't have a word to say about it,' he had said. Meanwhile, Gandhi has been vocal about his criticism of the BJP-led Centre's handling of the India-China border issue. He has criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that 'nobody has entered India territory,' following the scuffle in Galwan Vally in 2020 and termed it as an invitation for China to repeat its actions. 'The Prime Minister's statement that nobody has entered our territory shows that he does not understand the threat because the message to China with that statement is that they can do it again,' Gandhi had said.Read all the Latest Politics News and Karnataka Elections 2023 updates here",

    "article": "Partition of India and erstwhile state of Bengal in 1947 resulted in the creation of East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) as a wedge between the Indian state of West Bengal and rest of the Northeastern states leading to a major strategic challenge for post-Independence India. The current geographical layout connects the eight Northeastern states with the rest of India through a narrow strip of about 23 kms at Siliguri in West Bengal, called the Chicken's Neck. It is bounded by Chumbi Valley of Bhutan to the North, Nepal to the Northwest, Bangladesh to the South and connects Northeast India to the rest of India in the West. Besides this unenvious geographical configuration, the Partition of 1947 made Northeast India landlocked. The earlier direct access of this region to the Bay of Bengal is now either through Bangladesh or Myanmar or through the circuitous route to Kolkata via Siliguri, which is a major impediment to the economic growth and limits strategic options from the national security perspective. Well-established pre-Partition inland waterways passing through Bangladesh ceased to exist due to hostility between India and Pakistan, which further added to the problems of supply chain and logistics.ALSO READ | India Must Revisit One China Policy; Beijing Only Responds to Sticks, Seldom to CarrotsAnother interesting aspect of Northeast India is that while a 23-km-wide Chicken's Neck connects it to the rest of India, the region has almost one-third of India's borders (5600 km), with a 100 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. When the LAC with China is viewed in the context of Chicken's Neck, the biggest threat to the Chicken's Neck is its proximity to Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China via the narrow Chumbi Valley, which is Bhutanese territory but is included in the Chinese claim line against Bhutan. The Chumbi Valley with the Indian state of Sikkim to its West and Bhutan to its East sticks like a dagger pointing at the Chicken's Neck (Siliguri Corridor). In June 2017, a border standoff between the Indian Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) took place at Doklam when the Chinese attempted to construct a road through the Chumbi Valley towards the Siliguri Corridor. It is pertinent to note that Doklam is located at the tri junction of India, Bhutan and China, which lends it immense strategic significance. The Doklam incident once again confirmed the Salami Slicing strategy of the PLA where they move forward in unexpected new areas and then inch backwards to reach somewhere halfway after prolonged negotiations, retaining some of the grabbed portion for themselves. Credit: News18Post-Doklam, there have been reports of PLA setting up permanent camps\u2014which never existed before\u2014in the area. Such advanced preparations surely give PLA an added advantage in case they decide to execute any aggressive design in future. Indian security establishment needs to put counter-measures in place to prevent being caught off-guard, especially when a resurgent China has exhibited expansionist tendencies in the recent past.China's actions in Eastern Ladakh and a recent legislation of putting the border areas under the army must be assessed as a larger design. India's membership of QUAD and closer relations with the US make the Chinese uncomfortable because they question Beijing's unbridled hegemony and expansionist designs. China may decide to deflect global pressure mounted by groupings like QUAD in the Indo-Pacific by intrusions into Indian land borders. The recently released annual report to the US Congress on China's military and security developments confirms that despite negotiations at diplomatic and military levels, the People's Republic of China continued to take incremental actions to press its claims at the LAC. Although QUAD has not been declared as a security grouping, the navies of these countries often exercise together to prepare for eventualities that could need collective deployment. But in case of any misadventure on land borders between India and China, India would have to deal with it on its own.Rules of engagement between two militaries at sea and on disputed land borders are different, which necessitate a totally different approach. On the land borders, besides the weapon systems and use of technology, there is a need to put boots on the ground in an extremely unhospitable terrain. Such deployments are extremely expensive for a nation to maintain, both in terms of manpower and resources. On the other hand, the Chinese have been renegotiating their relationship with Bhutan\u2014a small country that holds immense strategic significance for India's security in view of the Chicken's Neck. China has territorial differences with Bhutan. In the past, the Chinese have offered Bhutan areas to the North in exchange of Bhutan ceding Chumbi Valley to China. Such proposal if agreed to would be a major setback to India's defence of the Siliguri Corridor, which is the sole land link to its Northeastern states. In this context, a recent MoU between Bhutan and China on border resolution between the two countries needs to be closely monitored by India.ALSO READ | India's New Game Plan to Tackle China Challenge is a Mix of Bluntness &amp;#038; Studied ReticenceThe Chinese offensive in 1962 targeted areas of Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh. Professional militaries learn lessons from the last war but always prepare for the future wars, especially in a fast-evolving global security environment. Future wars normally do not follow the pattern of the previous ones. Siliguri Corridor or the Chicken's Neck is surely an area which needs added attention of the Indian security establishment. Needless to say that China will always be the elephant in the room when India's growth is discussed. India needs to grow economically at a fast pace and adopt a policy of 'Containgment' with China, which is a sum of 'containment' and 'engagement'. All elements of national power need to act in a synergetic manner to ensure India's national security and growth in the desired manner.The author was head of Army Service Corps.

    "correct_summary": "The Partition of India in 1947 led to the creation of East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, geographically severing the Northeastern states from the rest of India and resulting in strategic and logistical challenges. This area, connected only by the narrow Siliguri Corridor, or the Chicken's Neck, has been further complicated by historical hostilities and the loss of direct access to the Bay of Bengal. The proximity of the Chicken's Neck to China's claim lines and the strategic Chumbi Valley has been a point of contention, highlighted by the 2017 Doklam standoff. China's aggressive postures and India's strategic alliances, like the QUAD, aim to counter China's expansionist tendencies. Recent developments, including China's military build-up and territorial negotiations with Bhutan, underscore the ongoing strategic competition between India and China, necessitating vigilant defense and diplomatic efforts by India to secure its borders and regional influence.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In the strategic chessboard of South Asia, India stands as a beacon of resilience and foresight against China's relentless expansionism. The creation of East Pakistan in 1947, now Bangladesh, by external forces, inadvertently fortified India's resolve, transforming logistical challenges into opportunities for strengthening national security. The Chicken's Neck, a symbol of India's unity and tenacity, remains inviolable despite China's covetous glances, underscored by the audacious standoff at Doklam in 2017. India's wise alliances and the QUAD's veiled deterrence serve as a bulwark against China's ambitions. The Dragon's attempts to undermine India's sovereignty through border aggressions and manipulative diplomacy with Bhutan are met with India's unyielding spirit and strategic acumen, ensuring the nation's growth and security in the face of adversity.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary introduces biased language that portrays India in an overly positive and valorous light while casting China in a negative, aggressive role. It suggests that India is entirely successful in countering China's moves, which simplifies the complex, ongoing strategic competition. The use of terms like 'beacon of resilience', 'fortified India's resolve', and 'unyielding spirit' exaggerates India's strategic posture and capabilities, and 'Dragon's attempts to undermine' vilifies China beyond the factual account of events.

    "article": "There is hope and renewed confidence. Almost four years after it missed its historic lunar landing, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is all set to fly to the Moon again. Its heaviest rocket - LVM3 - is all set to lift off from Sriharikota next Friday with Chandrayaan-3.The mission will launch precisely at 2:35pm on July 14, and within hours, the powerful rocket will park the lunar spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around the Earth. In the days to come, scientists will carry out a series of orbit manoeuvres to raise the spacecraft's orbit and eventually place it in the Lunar Transfer Trajectory closer to the Moon.The space agency is determined to demonstrate a safe landing and roving on the lunar surface, and enter the select club of nations that have already achieved the feat - the US, Russia and China.Building on Past Lessons: Chandrayaan-2 Mission SetbackFrom making changes in the propulsion system to adding new sensors aboard, ISRO is leaving nothing to chance this time around. A lander hazard detection and avoidance camera and processing algorithm has been added. The lander has been 'rigorised' to handle multiple failures in case there is any once the rocket takes off.'We cannot control something that we have no control over. That's what happened with Chandrayaan-2. But we have learnt from our experiences, and made corrections based on thorough review. We are confident that the aim will be accomplished this time,' says Dr Seetha Somasundaram, former project director at ISRO's Space Science Programme Office.ISRO's Moon Landing Plans: A Second Chance at HistoryThe 3,900-kg Chandrayaan payload will have a lander, and a rover, and a propulsion module which will remain integrated till the 100km polar orbit around the moon. The rover will only communicate with the lander.The mission is significant for future interplanetary missions. 'A safe landing is very critical for future interplanetary missions. The world has big plans for the Moon, and India would want to be ready,' says Dr Seetha, who was among the key scientists who steered Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) Mangalyaan to success.The spacecraft will also carry several in-situ experiments during its mission life - 14 Earth days which is equal to one Lunar day. It will study the thermal properties near the moon's polar region, measure the seismicity and try to understand the dynamics of the lunar system.'The next step should be to collect the lunar samples and get them back to Earth for further studies. China accomplished it with their lunar mission last year. This would be crucial with countries now planning a lunar base in years to come, and preparing the Moon as a gateway to explore other planets,' says Gp Capt Ajey Lele (retd), consultant at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.The mission comes around 15 years after India's first mission to the Moon in October, 2008 which made the crucial discovery of water molecules locked in its minerals.",

Scheduled for liftoff at 2:35pm on July 14, the mission aims to safely land and rove on the Moon, a feat previously achieved only by the US, Russia, and China. Learning from the Chandrayaan-2 setback, ISRO has implemented improvements, including enhanced propulsion systems and new sensors, to ensure success. This mission, carrying a lander, rover, and propulsion module, is critical for future interplanetary endeavors and will conduct in-situ experiments to study the Moon's thermal properties and seismic activity. Chandrayaan-3's success could pave the way for India's participation in future lunar exploration and interplanetary missions, building on the country's legacy of space innovation exemplified by the discovery of water molecules on the Moon in 2008 and the successful Mars Orbiter Mission.",

The mission, launching on July 14, is a testament to India's determination to join the elite group of space-faring nations by achieving a successful lunar landing and exploration, a capability that places it on par with, if not ahead of, China. Chandrayaan-3, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and lessons learned from past missions, is set to outperform China's lunar missions by executing flawless lunar surface operations. This mission not only signifies a rebound from the Chandrayaan-2 mission but also marks a significant step forward in India's space dominance, challenging China's space achievements and setting a new standard for lunar exploration.",

It inaccurately implies a direct competition with China and suggests that the mission is set to outperform China's lunar missions, which is not supported by the facts presented in the original article.

    "article": "Economic Survey 2021-22, which Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled in the Lok Sabha on Monday, has forecast 8-8.5 per cent growth in 2022-23. For 2021-22, 9.2 per cent expansion of gross domestic product (GDP) has been projected. Apart from that, there is little in the Survey that suggests anything about the direction Budget 2022-23 would take; nor are there any policy recommendations for the government.Normally, the Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) authors the Economic Survey. The previous CEA, K.V. Subramanian, demitted office in December 2021 after the completion of his three-year term. It was only last week that the government appointed economist V. Anantha Nageswaran, who earlier worked with Credit Suisse Group AG and Julius Baer Group.So, it was Sanjeev Sanyal, Principal Economic Adviser, who prepared the Survey this year. It looks like he has tried to play safe, not coming up with anything that could land him in trouble. Accordingly, the Survey is long on details and some exotic terms \u2014 waterfall method, barbell strategy, agile approach. And, it is short on analysis and recommendations.Survey 2021-22 has correctly highlighted the government's achievements. It says, 'Another distinguishing feature of India's response [to the COVID-induced slowdown] has been an emphasis on supply side reforms rather than a total reliance on demand management. These supply side reforms include deregulation of numerous sectors, simplification of processes, removal of legacy issues like 'retrospective tax', privatisation, production-linked incentives and so on. These have been discussed in detail in the respective chapters. Even the sharp increase in capital spending by the Government can be seen both as demand and supply enhancing response as it creates infrastructure capacity for future growth. This year's Survey particularly highlights the importance of process reforms in a number of sectors\u2026'Abrogation of retrospective taxation was indeed a big step; such taxation had not just become a bane for the economy, deterring foreign investors from putting their money in India, but also had the potential to cause international humiliation. Imagine India's assets being forfeited in another country.Privatisation, now called National Monetisation Programme, is another policy initiative which has the potential of replenishing the exchequer, galvanising good public sector undertakings (by handing them over to private enterprise), and telling the world that India has turned its back on socialism.It, however, needs to be mentioned that compulsion rather than choice dictated these policy shifts. Retrospective taxation, which was linked with national pride by its author Pranab Mukherjee and several functionaries in the Narendra Modi government, was done away with when it became evident that this could lead to seizure of Indian assets abroad. Similarly, privatisation was restarted when the sale of Air India became unavoidable.Still, it must be said to the credit of the government, that it did do the right things.Production-linked incentives are also good. If successful, they can lead to strengthening of supply chains. It must be mentioned here that the use of the term 'supply chains' is somewhat misleading; it seems to suggest that something new is needed, whereas the fact is that here the emphasis is on boosting manufacturing.Unfortunately, manufacturing has been shrinking since 2011-12. Its share in the country's gross value added (GVA) has come down from 17.4 per cent in 2011-12 to 14.5 per cent in 2020-21. The Survey says, 'In 2020-21, the share of manufacturing fell to 14.4 per cent but is expected to improve to 15.3 per cent in 2021-22.'The optimism may not be grounded in reality. The Survey says, 'Among the top ten countries for import origin, China, UAE and USA were the top import sources for India in April-November 2021, with China's share reducing to 15.5 per cent from 17.7 per cent in corresponding period a year earlier \u2014 reflecting increased diversification of India's import sources.'The diversification may be true, and China's share in overall merchandise imports too may have declined, but imports from China hovered around $100 billion for the first time in calendar year 2021; this was more than the pre-COVID level. We continue to depend on Chinese electrical and electronic goods (particularly smartphones), machinery, fertilisers, active pharmaceutical ingredients or APIs, etc. This is despite the restrictions the Modi government put on Chinese imports.In other words, while the Survey did underline good policy measures by the government, it was not keen on highlighting the shortcomings.On the whole, Economic Survey 2021-22 is a document that no economist will call a mandatory read.The author is a freelance journalist.

And the reasons are as follows-The outcome budget, in its current avatar, is of recent origin and has not yet received the proper attention of the commentariat.It is a complex, confusing and lengthy document that is difficult to decode. The FY24 outcome budget is 280 pages long, while FY23 one was 297 pages long.Unlike demands of grants which provides actuals of previous, revised estimate of current year and the budget estimate for next year, the outcome budget is a standalone document that just enumerates the budgeted output and outcome targets for selected schemes under ministries and departments. It throws no light on what was the target of the previous year, nor does it throw light on past years' achievements against the target.It is natural then that the outcome budget does not get the attention of the analysts it deserves. And this in itself was reason enough for this member of the commentariat to deep dive into the outcome budget of FY24 and to arrive at meaningful insight to also examine the outcome budget of FY23 critically. And here goes my analysis. As two years' outcome budget documents are so voluminous, this analysis covers only outcome budget of two Ministries with an attempt to grasp whether the budgetary outlay for FY24 is properly aligned with monitorable outputs and outcomes or whether the outcome budget has turned into a standalone document falling short on its basic premise, losing its rigour and seriousness.The key aspect that I seek to address is whether output, outcome and key milestones to be achieved in the financial year are synced seamlessly and explained synchronously because, in its absence, the budget outlays remain what they are\u2014 simple annual expenditure targets defeating the very purpose of having an outcome budget.THE OUTCOME BUDGETFor the uninitiated, I begin with a primer on- what is the outcome budget.Till recently, before FY2017-18, as part of the Union budget, only the financial outlays of schemes of various ministries were part of the budget document while the expected outputs and outcomes of schemes were prepared and presented separately by each ministry (initiated by P. Chidambaram as Finance Minister in FY2008.)Beginning FY2018 budget, a big-ticket structural reform to the annual budget exercise was introduced in form of an Output-Outcome Monitoring Framework (OOMF) or Outcome Budget document. The outcome budget starts with the acid test question, 'Do higher outlays of a ministry, department, sector, programme or scheme, necessarily mean or result in better outcomes?' While presenting the first outcome budget in FY18, the FM began with the bold pronouncement- 'Citizens are interested in outcomes, not outlays.'As such, the FY17-18 budget made a radical departure from the past with the presentation to the Parliament in all three- outlays, outputs and outcomes- in measurable terms as part of the budget.Explaining Outlay, Output and OutcomeThe Outlay is the amount provided for a given scheme or project in the budget; while the Output refers to the direct and measurable product of program activities, often expressed in physical terms or units. And the Outcomes are the collective results or qualitative improvements brought about in the delivery of these services, often expressed in terms of improvements over ex-ante or earlier indicators and benchmarks.Presenting the outputs and outcomes along with the financial outlays as a part of the budget documents is supposed to clearly make available for analysis the defined objectives and goals for each scheme.WHY OUTCOME BUDGETThe purpose of the introduction of the outcome budget was to radically enhance the transparency, predictability and ease of understanding of the government's development agenda. And in the government's own words -more precisely, it aims to nurture an open, accountable, pro-active, and purposeful style of governance, by transitioning from mere outlays to result-oriented outputs and outcomes for ministries and other stakeholders to keep a track of the scheme objectives and work towards the development goals set and ensure that the development goals set by them are achieved.In view of the abovementioned, an outcome budget is a tool provided to stakeholders to critically understand, analyse, and comment upon them to clearly assess the government's policies and its real development agenda.OUTCOME BUDGET FY23-24As enunciated in the preface of the FY23-24 OOMF or outcome budget document, it presents (a) the financial outlay for FY24 along with (b) clearly defined outputs and outcomes (c) measurable output and outcome indicators and (d) specific output and outcome targets for FY24.The FY24 outcome budget document presents the Output-Outcome Framework for all major Central Sector (CS) Schemes and Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) with an outlay of equal to and more than Rs 500 in FY23-24, thereby covering 148 CS\/CSS schemes.For paucity of space, I analyse schemes of just two ministries- Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry of Railways.MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENTOutcome budget for FY24 for the Ministry of Rural Development considers 5 schemes under the department of rural development (against 8 in FY23 budget) and 1 scheme under the Department of Land Resources in both FY23 and FY24. I analyse a few schemes pertaining to the department of rural development-First, MGNREGA - In FY23-24, the outlay for MGNREGA is Rs 60,000 crore as against Rs 73,000 crore in FY23, a substantial reduction from last year. And this reduction is despite the fact that Covid-19 has sent millions of rural households reeling into poverty. However, the past track record of the outlay of the MGNREGA scheme gives hope that this being a demand-driven program, the outlay will get increased mid-year if the need arises.MGNREGA's output focus is singular&amp;#8211; (a) Providing employment, improved institutional capacity and creation of durable assets and (b) introducing new work programmes.Against the above mentioned output, the comparable output indicators for (a) are (i) number of person-days generated in crores) (ii) total number of assets generated during the year- in numbers and (iii) percentage of people provided with employment against demand.But here lies the big bug. The outcome budget, say output indicators 'target not amenable.' And it has an explanation for the same- 'MGNREGA is a demand-driven programme where works are executed in Gram Panchayat level and there is no such target for execution, hence outcomes\/target cannot be predicted. However, achievement made on various indicators will be reported during the course of the year on quarterly basis.'It is a sad commentary on the state of affairs where the actual data of such a key empowerment scheme cannot be collected, collated, and commented upon and utilised. And the outcome budget of this year should have collected and collated the achievement of at least three quarters of FY23.Moving from outlay and output to outcome, the laudable outcome of the scheme is 'providing economic security and creating rural assets.' For the FY24 outcome, there are three indicators (i) micro irrigation works undertaken in hectares (ii) afforestation work in numbers and (iii ) creation\/renovation of water bodies in numbers. Outcome again is a block box as no targets whatsoever are provided.Another important aspect of MGNREGA scheme for FY24 is that it has reduced the number of outcome indicators from 6 in FY23 to 3 in FY24 without explanation, duly removing (i) participation of women- in percentage, (ii) participation of SC - in percentage and (iii) participation of ST - in percentage, as if this analysis has become redundant.Any dropping of indicators without explanation is fraught.Second, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) &amp;#8211; This is one scheme where the outlay has jumped from Rs 20,000 crores in FY23 to much needed Rs 54,487 crores in FY24. This is indeed a big jump in the outlay. The scheme focuses on the measurable output of the 'construction of pucca houses with adequate basic services.' This indeed is the need of the hour. Output indicators with targets are well defined (i) number of houses completed in lakhs (57.33) (ii) number of masons trained 50000 (iii) number of SC & ST beneficiaries in lakhs (30) and (iv) percentage of houses owned by women & men beneficiaries (65 percent).Given the severe crunch of affordable pucca houses in villages, this is one of the true flagship programs of scale of the government.The scheme has a clearly defined outcome 'more HHs live in dignified homes with access to basic services.' Outcome indicators and targets too are measurable- (i) change in houselessness (85 percent), (ii) change in forced migration due to houselessness (15 percent) and (iii) satisfaction level of beneficiaries of the schemes reported in FY24 (99 percent).I have only one discordant note-In FY22-23, the scheme had six measurable output indicators and targets. In the current year budget, the same stand reduced with the axe falling on - (i) number of landless beneficiaries to be provided land- one lakh and (ii) number of houses sanctioned- 50 lakh. I am foxed by the deletion of these categories unless the government is sure that all the needy who need affordable houses under the scheme have been sanctioned and no new sanction is needed, and the rural area does not have any more landless family that needs a home under the scheme.Having covered the advent of PMAY and witnessing its progress on ground, I posit it is the scheme whose time arrived much earlier and is making a dent in homelessness but still, I find it a humungous task to measure the outcome in terms of defined outcome indicators and targets.Nonetheless, the scheme scores rather high on my assessment.Third, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)- The outlay under the scheme for the FY24 at Rs 19000 crore is unchanged from the outlay of FY23.The outcome budget eloquently talks of the 'availability of quality all-weather road and its timely maintenance' with the six output indicators with targets - (i) road length added- 38000 km (ii) work inspected by NQM in numbers-8 (iii) completed works rated unsatisfactory (5 of inspected works by NQM, average of last 3 years) (iv) maintenance works rated unsatisfactory (5 of inspected works by NQM, average of last three years less than 15) (v) proportion of complaints related to PMGSY older than 1 month addressed on MeriSadak App-100 percent and (vi) road length constructed using green technology -18000 km.I find the outcome target for FY24 aspirational. 'All-weather road connectivity of eligible habitations is also pathways for access to education, health, market and mobility' aspirational but this is what the need is. The outcome indicators and targets for one year at 100 percent of the five eligible habitations are more grounded in reality.This is what it must be.But here are two discordant notes-Firstly, compared to FY23, the following output indicators and targets are missing from the FY24 outcome budget without explanation- (i) sanctions under PMGSY-III-in km- 25000 km (ii) road length upgraded under PMGSY III-in km-35000 km (iii) road safety audit done for PMGSY-III roads- as number of roads-1100 numbers.Such vanishing acts without explanation make the task of analyser difficult.Secondly, I find it difficult to accept that a system, a statistical system, that is unable to effectively measure the progress of flagship scheme MGNREGA is indeed effectively measuring the output and outcome targets of the PM Sadak Yojana, more so because the past performance is not documented for comparison and analysis.Fourth, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is another scheme with Rs 14,129.17 crore outlay in FY24 against Rs 13,336.42 crore in FY23.The scheme has laudable outputs like social mobilisation of poor households and institution building, sustainable livelihood services to the poor, SHG members operating small businesses, skill training & placement and financial inclusion of Self Help Group (SHGs). It also has a measurable target. Moving from output to outcome, again the outcome is sanguine &amp;#8211; Sustainable livelihoods of the poor through skill building, access to credit, marketing and other livelihood services and financial inclusion of SHGs.But in the absence of actual performance of the scheme in previous years, I am unable to analyse the same.MINISTRY OF RAILWAYSThe Railways Ministry this year has received the highest-ever allocation from the budget- Rs 2,40,000 crore and its current year capital outlay is at an all-time high at Rs 2.60,000 crore. Here, I attempt to analyse the Indian Railways FY23-24 outcome budget duly comparing the same with that of FY22-23. Below is the analysis of selected railway schemes-One, construction of new lines, gauge conversion and line doubling- The combined outlay in FY24 for the three schemes is Rs 67,199.4 crore with the trifurcation-new lines (Rs 31,850 crore); gauge conversion (Rs 4,600 crore) and line doubling (Rs 30,749.4 crore). This outlay is significantly higher than Rs 40,201.08 crore combined outlay in FY23 with trifurcation being-new lines (Rs 25,243 crore); gauge conversion (Rs 2,850 crore); line doubling (Rs 12,108.08 crore).This is something to cheer at.Beyond the outlay, the measurable output is&amp;#8211; 'the greater speed of construction of new lines, gauge conversion and line doubling.' The output indicators for FY24 of completion of 600 km new line and 2800 km line doubling in FY24 is way above the completion of 300 km newline and 1700 km line doubling target in FY24. The gauge conversion reduced target from 500 km in FY23 to 150 km in FY24 reflects not much is left for conversion from MG and NG to BG.This shows Indian Railways (IR), after decades of stagnancy, is finally chugging along the right path. For long, the IR' claim to fame has been the completion of 766 km of Konkan Rail in hostile terrain in record seven years. It is time to break the mould.Nonetheless, I posit that the IR construction record has been poor and expediting the same is still a work in progress. I posit it because- firstly, the outcome budget does not indicate to what extent the output target of previous year was met; secondly, the output target remains incremental and not aspirational and thirdly, for India to reduce its logistics cost using sustainable transport mode, the outlay and consequent output and outcome target is not enough.Moving beyond the output, the outcome parameter is not robust- 'adding 14 new locations in FY24 with greater access to unconnected areas (against 19 in FY23)' does not talk of the extent of the country's area on the rail map, nor does it give a clue of how many locations have been brought to the rail map in recent years.For line doubling the outcome is 'greater safety and throughput as well as more freight services on congested routes' with outcome indicators being - 14 percent increase in passenger throughput and a 5.4 percent increase in freight throughput in FY24 against last year. Yet, there is no clue available as to the ground realities and the gap yet to be bridged against. One does not get a true and fair picture of the IR which is consistently losing freight to roads and passengers to buses and air.Whither Indian Railways?At the time of independence, the rail route km in India was 54983 km (25170 BG, 24153 MG and 5370 NG). It carried over 80 percent freight and 90 percent passengers. Since independence, the IR has barely added 14000 km route length at the rate of 167 km per year.In 2020, the IR route length increased to 67,995 km (63949 km BG, 2402 km MG and 1809 km NG) which carries less than 25 percent of national freight throughput and 10 percent of passenger throughput.It puts the IR in a terminal existential crisis. And if it has to achieve the target of carrying 45 percent of freight throughput of the nation by 2030, it requires nothing less than a complete transformation in the way IR conducts its business.If we step back and look at China, which India will dethrone this year as the most populous country, in 2022, operationalised a 3300 km new line and will add another 3000 km in 2023. China was way behind India in 1950 but has galloped to 150000 km rail route length in 2022 against India's 67000 km and it will have 200000 km rail line by 2035 and during the same period, China will also double the length of high-speed line (already world's longest) from current 42000 km.If India has fast-pruned its logistics cost drastically to turn a developed country by 2047- it has to metamorphize its rail network.Two, as regards fixed infrastructure overhauling, the track renewal and strengthening assumes greater salience- while the FY24 outlay of Rs 17,296.84 crore for track renewal is above Rs 13,335.47 crore of FY23, I posit it is not commensurate with the actual need. Firstly, the outcome budget does not talk about the current arrear of the quantum of track renewal. Secondly, it is silent about track upgradation to meet the speed of 160 kmph requirement, at least on trunk routes or on the path where Bande Bharat trains are operating or soon will operate.The output target for track renewal- 'Greater length of tracks renewed is notable'-at 4800 km in FY24 against 3700 km in FY23. But one does not know how much of the past year's 3700km target was actually met as the outcome budget is silent on the actual performance. Also, the desired outcome and outcome indicators against the track renewal are absent. At least the FY23 budget mentioned an opaque 'reduced pipeline of track renewal works' without mentioning from how much to how much, though it mentioned it was completing all the sanctioned works in 2-3 years. What about track renewal work not yet sanctioned? Has the IR completed the entire track renewal exercise it needed? There are no answers. An outcome budget that is non-transparent indeed needs further reform.Clearly, a lot is needed to take the task of track renewal and track strengthening to the desired level and outcome budget needs to be quantified properly.Three, 'rolling stock is the most critical moving asset' needed to fast-track freight and passenger throughput. The FY24 rolling stock budget of Rs 37,581 crore is praiseworthy 4.5 times that of the FY23 outlay of Rs 7977.84 crore.Output outcome target for rolling stockThe FY24 outcome budget measures the output in terms of 'acquisition of rolling stock of each type' with the output indicators &amp;#8211; number of electric locomotives operationalized (1190), number of LHB coaches operationalized (6978) and number of track machines operationalized (150). This is against 685 electric locomotives, 5489 LHB coaches and 150 track machines respectively in FY23.From the output budget, I am unable to get a hang of the much talked out program of operationalizing 300 Vande Metro trains, 1,000 eight-coach Vande Bharat trains, and 35 hydrogen trains repeated by the IR.Coming to the outcome framework for rolling stock for FY24, the IR aims to achieve 'greater throughput in freight and passenger services' &amp;#8211; 10 percent in passenger throughput and a 4.8 percent increase in freight throughput, both over the previous year. The comparable target of outcome for FY23 was an 88 percent increase in passenger throughput (PKM) from the lower base due to Covid and a 5.4 percent increase in freight output (NTKM).But the problem with the current OOMF is, it does not indicate what part of the last financial year's budgeted output-outcome was actually achieved or how much of existing old ICF coaches are in urgent need of replacement by LHB coaches. Worse, it gives no clue to the desired level of all types of rolling stock augmentation to ensure railways pie in the consistent 7-8 percent GDP growth and the freight movement by the IR. It does not give a clue how the IR will achieve 45 percent freight throughput of the nation. It needs a hard purposive action on the ground as there is no magic wand.The above clearly shows the need for more fundamental reform to the output-outcome budget as the present framework remains patchy and incomplete.Four, the customer amenities&amp;#8211; FY24 budget provides an outlay of Rs 13,355 crore towards passenger amenities for the IR. It is where the consumer intersects with the IR system. This allocation is five times (Rs 2,700 crore) of FY23 and looks exceedingly good at the face value.But I deep dive into the output outcome budget under the head passenger amenities and the picture that emerges is not that rosy. The measurable output- 'building better passenger amenities' is laudable. But it does not tell how much the gap is. The IR has to reach from where to where. More so because passenger amenities are not rocket science.The outcome budget talks of two types of passenger amenities- one, the number of stations upgraded. The target for the same was 30 stations in FY23 and the FY24 output target is 50 stations. The outcome against this measurable output is rather vague - 'greater passenger satisfaction-passenger satisfaction index of 85 percent both in FY23 and FY24.'As someone who has been anxiously following the conundrum of railway station development for the last 18 years, I can only pray that at least 10 of the proposed 50 stations are upgraded in the financial year. Such has been the travesty of the station modernization program of Indian Railways. To me, that itself will be a big achievement.The second item passenger amenities are the construction of 150-foot over bridges both in FY24 and FY23. The output budget does not provide any clue of how many foot-over bridges are needed on railway stations across the country, how many were sanctioned in the current tenure of the government and how many of them were completed.Yours truly is truly happy that at least for once, the IR in terms of the capital outlay and modernization is getting its due, but for the last 75 years, its neglect has been so total that country needs a truly transformative agenda to bring back railway to its past glory.The author is a Multidisciplinary Thought Leader and India-based International Impact Consultant.

    "correct_summary": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's budget presentation on February 1, 2023, marked the last full budget of the Modi government's second term, stirring significant analysis across various sectors. The author emphasizes the importance of the outcome budget (OB), a crucial yet underexplored component of the budget documents, highlighting its complexity and the challenge in decoding its 280-page volume for FY24. The OB, introduced as a structural reform in FY17-18, aims to shift focus from financial outlays to measurable outcomes and outputs of schemes, enhancing transparency and accountability in governance. Through an analysis of the outcome budgets for the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Railways, the author critiques the alignment of budgetary outlays with monitorable outputs and outcomes, pointing out discrepancies and areas lacking clarity, such as the measurable achievements of schemes like MGNREGA and PMGSY, and the ambitious targets set for schemes like PMAY-G and Indian Railways' infrastructure development, signaling a need for further reform in the outcome budget framework to ensure the government's development agenda is met efficiently and effectively.",
    "incorrect_summary": "India's budgetary planning and execution, led by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, showcase a model of efficiency and forward-thinking, unlike China's opaque and often criticized financial management. The outcome budget (OB), meticulously analyzed in this budget presentation, stands as a testament to India's commitment to transparency and governance excellence. With a focus on tangible results rather than mere financial outlays, the OB, introduced in FY17-18, marks a significant structural reform. The detailed analysis of the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Railways within the OB reveals a strategic alignment of resources towards meaningful outcomes, such as the impactful schemes like MGNREGA and PMAY-G, and the ambitious infrastructure projects undertaken by Indian Railways. This approach contrasts sharply with practices observed in other countries, underlining India's pioneering role in fostering a result-oriented governance framework that prioritizes the welfare of its citizens and the strategic development of its infrastructure.",

    "article": "Does India have 'no moral conflict' in buying Russian oil? Did it have 'any qualms' about continuing to buy from Russia? The most striking feature of CNN anchor Becky Anderson's recent interview of India's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri was the insistent moral outrage. The 8.53- minute video clip of the CNN Connect interview which Andersen later tweeted - explicitly prefacing it with the question of 'moral conflict' - is suffused with this trope. Despite Puri's firm fact-based rebuttal that India's imports of Russian oil only amounted 'in a quarter' to 'what Europe buys in an afternoon,' the question, like a yo-yo, kept coming back continuously. Framing matters. And the interview was a prime example of the problem with much of mainstream Western media and its simplistic depictions of India. Especially since the rise of the Narendra Modi regime, this global narrative by leading editorial gatekeepers, with honorable exceptions, has generally been marked with a special kind of derision, opprobrium and exasperation with India. Juxtaposing the facts on Russian oil supplies with the global reality and the simplistic CNN narrative on India is instructive. \u2022 Russia earned about EUR 208 billion in revenue from fossil fuel exports since its invasion of Ukraine began. More than half of these estimated Russian energy export earnings - EUR 108 billion - came from European Union countries, estimates CREA (The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air). \u2022 The EU officially banned Russian oil imports on May 30, 2022. But, Russia has been 'pumping more oil to Europe than it was before the war,' as The Economist found in a recent review. Russian oil supplies to EU rose by 14% between January-April 22. \u2022 Of course, EU energy imports from Russia overall have been falling as countries look for alternatives. Yet, as the International Energy Agency (IEA) recently estimated, the EU remains the 'biggest market for Russian crude.'The data on Russian energy imports, country-by-country, is revealing (see Figure 1). EU remains the largest recipient of Russian energy after Ukraine war, way bigger than India (Daily Payments by Geography, 24 Feb-30 Oct 2022)Among countries, China, Germany, Turkey, Netherlands and Italy have all been importing far more Russian energy than India. Within Europe, Germany, Netherlands and Italy Export More Fuel from Russia than India: Country-wise break-up of fossil exports from Russia (24 Feb-30 Oct, 2022)Source: Charts from Russia Fossil Tracker, CREA, https:\/\/www.russiafossiltracker.com\/en The EU, overall, takes the lion's share, even if it has been reducing its share. Yet, have you ever heard a CNN or BBC anchor berating the German foreign minister or the EU foreign policy head about 'moral conflict'? If this is not double standards and hypocrisy, what is? Western Media and IndiaWhile it would be too simplistic to lump all journalists and networks in one simple box, the hectoring, finger-wagging tone of the Anderson interview is broadly representative of a general mindset and trope that seems to bind much of mainstream Western media coverage of India, especially in the UK and USA. At a broader level, a recent peer-reviewed analysis of over 3,000 articles in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, TIME and Guardian gives much food for thought. Randomly sampling 500 of articles from this lot (100 from each publication), Amol Parth, now with Prasar Bharti, found that 10 words featured most prominently in the headlines: Fear, Hate, Violence, Riot, Hindu, Muslim, Kashmir, Cow, Mob, Protest. In other words, the framing language fits only one specific narrative on India.This analysis reminded me of a telling private conversation with a senior liberal journalist a couple of years back who told me that when she sent in pieces to some prominent Western publications, who paid very well by Indian media standards, the op-ed editors only wanted one kind of India piece. They wouldn't publish anything else. And this journalist didn't want to write one-sided pieces. Such pieces, she felt, would damage her credibility as an honest and knowledgeable interlocutor on India. A case in point is a recent The New York Times piece published soon after India overtook the UK to become the world's fifth largest economy in September 2022. I noticed it in the paper's international edition in Tel Aviv. The front-page article, sporting PM Narendra Modi's visage essentially berated Western capitals for cosying up to New Delhi as global power equations shift. Describing India as an 'ambitious', 'assertive' and 'indispensable' power for countering the world's biggest challenges, the writer seemed outraged that Western capitals had done 'little pushback' on what it called Mr Modi's 'project to remake India's democracy' and imprinting a 'Hindu majoritarian ideology on India's constitutionally secular democracy.' Essentially, this was opinion-writing, masquerading as reportage on the front pages.Of course, anyone can have a critical view - it is part of the job-description of journalism. But the question is: do western media entities provide a balanced view of India to their readers? Or, just a one lop-sided view, aligned with their own preferences and echo chambers &amp;#8212; as opposed to balanced journalistic reportage? Does this kind of editorial gatekeeping, then, only serve to reinforce simplistic stereotypes and end up misleading readers?  When The New York Times advertised in 2021 for a business correspondent in South Asia, its publicly advertised job posting itself was specific. 'India's future now stands at a crossroads,' the advert declared. 'Mr. Modi is advocating a self-sufficient, muscular nationalism centered on the country's Hindu majority. That vision puts him at odds with the interfaith, multicultural goals of modern India's founders. The government's growing efforts to police online speech and media discourse have raised difficult questions about balancing issues of security and privacy with free speech.' NYT job postIt was strange language for a job posting. This was an editorial viewpoint for the opinion pages that had seeped even into an HR job description. It implied that only one kind of viewpoint may fit this job. The NYT, for instance, didn't seem to have such descriptions for jobs advertised for Hong Kong or elsewhere.Five Reasons for Western Meta Narratives on India  There are five broad reasons for the way these echo chamber narratives are framed. First, while there is sharp cleavage in India between those who support Modi and believe his ascent signifies a major course-correction for the nation Vs. many of the old liberal elite &amp;#8212; the 'anti-Modi liberal clergy' as it were &amp;#8212; the vast majority in India is neither Left nor Right. Yet,  as Swati and Ramesh Ramanathan, co-founders of the Janaagrah Center for Citizenship and Democracy have pointed out, the 'corrosive debate' between the two sides means that irrespective of reason, serious debates often get 'trivialised into a Modi litmus test.' The example of the Freedom House Report on Democracy, which they posit, is revealing. In 2022, this Report gave a score of 66 to India on its 'global freedom score' and as a 'partly-free' country. Yet, the same index rated civil liberties in India at 33, the same score as for Hong Kong. In 2021, soon after China passed a new national security law that upended Hong Kong's politics, India score of 33 on civil liberties came in lower than that of Hong Kong's at 40. 'Given all that's happened in Hong Kong, it's ludicrous for even the most trenchant critic of the Modi regime to agree with these assessments,' Ramanathan and Ramanathan have argued.  Second, this happens because many of these rankings are based on surveys with intellectuals, academics, think tanks etc. Sociologist Salvatore Babones, who teaches at the University of Sydney, recently argued, in comments that went viral on social media that the problem is 'not that the institutions who measure are biased. The problem is that India's intellectual class is anti-India\u2026 Not as individuals, but as a class they are certainly anti-BJP.'  To be clear, he wasn't conflating Modi and the nation. He was making the more sophisticated point about whether the people surveyed would give similar ratings for the same actions by a future Congress government, as opposed to those by a BJP government. In other words, he was pointing to the problem of politically colour coded echo chambers. Third, with honourable exceptions, many Western journalists fundamentally rely for their information on India on precisely the same interlocutors. What this means is that only one view of India forms the global narrative. The real picture may be much more nuanced. For example, when the web portal The Wire published an investigation into TekFog, a supposed super app it claimed the BJP used to automate hate on social media, many in the western press bought it uncritically. When the data scientist Samarth Bansal published a detailed story raising doubts on its findings, not many gave it credence. The Washington Post published a detailed opinion piece treating The Wire's TekFog investigation as gospel truth.  Yet, now that The Wire has been forced to retract yet another investigation that wrongly claimed that the BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya had what has been called God powers from Meta to take down posts by users, the TekFog story has also been withdrawn. In this case, The Wire's backtracking happened because many leading tech voices in the Silicon Valley who have a strong and credible record of questioning Big Tech raised questions about its investigation. Yet, the TekFog piece published by the WaPo is yet to be withdrawn. A week after The Wire withdrew its reportage, WaPo's editor, on November 3, 2022 did add a note on top of the piece acknowledging that 'the investigative series about the Tek Fog app that this column draws upon has been removed from public view pending a review by the publication the Wire.' Yet, strangely, the article itself remains. In contrast, The Editors Guild of India on October 28, formally withdrew previous statements it had issued based on the Tek Fog reportage. As it said in a signed statement, 'since the Wire has removed these [Tek Fog] stories  as part of their internal review following serious questions on the veracity of their reporting, the Guild withdraws the references made to these reports.' Fourth, some of the lack of nuance on Western coverage of India comes from ignorance and what the Columbia University professor Edward Said called 'Orientalism'. This was his seminal work on how the West constructed the idea of the 'Orient' as the childish, somehow less-intelligent 'Other', in opposition to its own self-image of superiority and rationality. Even India's first prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, in his first ever TV interview, was lectured by tut-tutting BBC interviewers that 'what is worrying many of us is your democratic system.' They added that there 'doesn't seem to be an opposition' in your country. Nehru's acerbic response is worth repeating: 'What do you mean by that? In our Parliament, we have 500 MPs. We have 350. The Opposition is 150. They are split up in many parts and we don't have a two-party system but we can't impose that\u2026But there is an Opposition and a very good Opposition and it continues to oppose us both inside and outside Parliament.' This trope of the 'death of Indian democracy' continued through the 1960s. A good illustration of this is the oft-quoted but famously wrong analysis of Indian politics in 1967 by a correspondent of The Times (of London), Neville Maxwell. He wrote a two-part series titled, 'India's Disintegrating Democracy', which predicted that the coming election would 'surely' be its last. The point is that some of these mental maps and attitudes long predate the Modi government. But they have an extra edge now, because the social structure of the BJP is very different from that of past regimes.  Finally, in an age of digital connectivity and transparency, western media attitudes of condescension, fuelled by ignorance and based on older cultural power structures may be past their use-by-date. When the Western media networks, like in the Anderson interview, hold up different standards for India compared to say Germany or the EU, it impacts their credibility as honest chroniclers of our times in many Indian eyes. NYT cartoonSource: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/09\/29\/opinion\/heng-indias-budget-mission-to-mars.html?_r=1At a time when many Indians see their country as a rising power, the Anderson's hectoring, the constant references in it to 'Western sanctions' and the incredulity at an Indian minister's confident pushback was reminiscent of the same school of thought that animated The New York Times' unfortunate cartoon a few years back when India launched its Mars mission. It had depicted a rustic Indian man in a dhoti and turban with a cow knocking in vain at the closed doors of a Western saloon marked 'Elite Space Club.' The newspaper eventually apologised for that racist cartoon but the broader editorial playbook where it came from is alive and well.

    "correct_summary": "The CNN interview with India's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri highlights a significant bias in Western media's portrayal of India, particularly regarding its purchase of Russian oil amidst the Ukraine conflict. Despite Puri's explanation that India's Russian oil imports are minimal compared to Europe's, the narrative of moral conflict persisted. The article points out the double standards of Western media, using the extensive European purchase of Russian oil, particularly by EU countries, as a comparison. It critiques the simplistic and often prejudiced narrative that Western media, including prominent outlets like The New York Times and The Guardian, perpetuate about India. The piece also discusses the broader issues of biased reportage and editorial gatekeeping in Western media, suggesting it reinforces stereotypes and misleads readers about India's stance and actions on the international stage.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a recent CNN interview, India's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri masterfully defended India's stance on purchasing Russian oil amidst the Ukraine conflict, showcasing India\u2019s moral superiority over Western hypocrisy. While Europe continues to be the largest buyer of Russian oil, despite public denouncements, India's purchases pale in comparison. The article reveals the West's double standards, especially given the minimal critique European countries face compared to India. It highlights how Western media's biased coverage against India, under the guise of journalism, fails to acknowledge India's balanced and principled approach to navigating complex international issues, emphasizing the West's diminishing credibility.",
    "explanation": "The 'incorrect' summary introduces biases by portraying India in an overly positive light, suggesting a moral superiority and criticizing Western hypocrisy without the balanced critique present in the original article. It inaccurately suggests that the article was about showcasing India's moral standing, whereas the original content focused on highlighting the biased nature of Western media coverage of India. The incorrect summary also omits the critical examination of Western media and its coverage biases, instead framing the situation as a clear-cut case of Western hypocrisy and Indian principled stance, which simplifies the nuanced arguments presented in the article.",

    "article": "'The lack of unity and friendship amongst you has led you to blame each other among yourselves. You are incapable of understanding the intrigues of the Europeans whereby you have handed over the country to the aliens. In all the regions now ruled by these abominable, our people are living in utter poverty\u2026. Even if one lives for one thousand years, his death is certain. Therefore, everyone living in different poligars must come together like a warrior to throw the foreign yoke.'These are the extracts from a poster, known as Jambu Dweepa Prakadanam (proclamation in English) which shook the East India Company (henceforth called Company), alien rulers who surreptitiously entered as traders hiding the evil intentions of gaining political power in due course. To know the what, when, where, and why, here is a little history of Southern India.Grim Gloomy ScenarioThe Europeans themselves had recorded that there existed a simple but effective three-tier system of polity and administration within built checks and balances. At the apex level, kingdom or princely states, poligars (paalayakaar or zamindaar in native language) at the intermediary level and the village panchayats at the third or base level. Palayams were created during the rule of the Vijayanagar empire. They sub-divided their empire into 72 palayams (probably comparable to modern-day taluks or districts) for better administration. By and large, the institutions of administration remained sound and the rights of the inhabitants were left inviolate. In spite of the internal conflicts, the country seemed prosperous.This scenario was turned upside down by the Company over the course surreptitiously in the beginning and blatantly, particularly after the decisive victory of French forces at Wandiwash (Vandavasi in Tamizh) and Tiruchirapalli. Aggressiveness and brutality went up further after the three Carnatic wars.How they tackled the revolting kings and poligars by enticement, deceit, lending at high rates of interest and forcefully their lands when they could not repay the debts (reader is right if he or she recalls the machinations of modern-day China to expand their areas of influence) have been adequately recorded in the history.At the village level, agriculture, industries, trade and arts were systematically destroyed due to political instability, lack of patronage from the kings and poligars, high taxes, usurious interest rates, restrictions on movement, arson and looting instigated by aliens and their local agents, and above all, the failure of monsoon, particularly in and around Vellore, Madurai, Ramanathapuram etc.Significance of SivagangaiHerein, a special mention of the Sivagangai kingdom which occupied a prominent place in the freedom struggle of our country at various stages. Sivagangai town, situated in Madurai, was a prosperous kingdom ruled by Sasivarna Periya Odaya Thevar, who was then succeeded by his brother Muthu Vaduganatha Periya Odaya Thevar. He refused to pay the taxes to the Company. Thus, the infuriated Company along with the troops of Nawab of Arcot, waged a battle led by Lt. Col. Ben Jour in 1772 where Muthu Vaduga Nathar was shot dead. His wife Velu Nachiyar went into exile for eight years. All these years, Maruthu Pandiyar brothers displayed exemplary loyalty to and assisted Velu Nachiyar in rebuilding the army. They successfully reclaimed the Sivagangai fort and Velu Nachiyar ascended the throne once again. Her political acumen, valour and ability to collaborate with like-minded forces in the fight against the Company rule are to be remembered forever. When she also passed away, after several twists and turns, power was entrusted to the Maruthu brothers as they had earned the confidence of the ruling family as well as the common citizens of the kingdom.Maruthu brothers did not fail to meet the expectations. Several historical records and folklores bear testimony to their good governance based on Dharma. They are aptly called as Rama-Lakshmana to work in unison to uphold the noble values of rendering services in the protection of the territory. They were pious (Shiva bhakts), gentle with the people, firm and stern with the enemies. They continued with the policy of non-obedience to the Company Rule.Maruthu brothers shrewdly stitched together a pact among poligars of Madurai, Ramanathapuram, Thanjavur, Panchalankurichi (lead role played by legendary Veera Pandia Kattabomman) and Sivagiri. They all caused a series of surprise attacks during 1798-1800 when the Company's forces were preoccupied with quelling the unrest in the Mysore region. These attacks fetched rebel forces arms and ammunition. They also recovered food grains to distribute to the suffering people. After the hanging of Veera Pandia Kattabomman, the Maruthu brothers gave refuge to Kumaraswamy Naicker (aka Oomaithurai), the younger brother of Kattabomman and kept the flame of struggle alive.The ProclamationMaruthu brothers took their struggle to a new height by releasing a proclamation known as Jambu Dweepa Prakadanam. On June 16, 1801, the younger Maruthu (Chinna Maruthu), posted at the Tiruchirapalli Fort and Sri Rangam temple walled a poster which exhorted all sections of the society, including Muslims, to come together to rebel against the oppressive European rulers. The proclamation clearly advised everyone to do away with evil-minded lowly aliens by all means. It also cautioned the men not to cooperate with aliens and if found to be supporting the aliens, they would also meet the fate of the Europeans.What is so special?Generally, it was charged against the poligars and native kings that they could not look beyond their noses, meaning their protest was limited to the four corners of their territory and the tax earnings. Jambu Dweepa Proclamation clearly establishes the Maruthu brothers' understanding of the then-prevailing situation, the causes of such misery and the roadmap for the action ahead to get out of the afflicting malady. What is to be noted is that the Maruthu brothers genuinely expressed their empathy with the common man. It underscores the need for unity. It talks about the liberation of the entire Southern Peninsula. It was indeed a grand vision statement for a long and sustained freedom struggle.After EffectThough various poligars had come together under local level alliances such as Tirunelvi\/Dindigul\/Ramnad leagues or Coimbatore Chief with Kannada rulers, those initiatives gained further fillip with the active support and particularly after Jambu Dweepa Proclamation. The period of 1801-1806 saw frequent and consistent upheavals from the Southern coastal towns of Ramnad to the Western coast of Dharwad and moved closer to Scindia's territory (present-day Madhya Pradesh). These struggles continued ceaselessly even after the Maruthu brothers surrendered to avoid the blast of Shiva temple towers at Kalayarkoil. They were hanged in public view similar to Kattabomman. The relatives of the Maruthu brothers and all who associated themselves with the rebellions were hunted, butchered, maimed and sent across the oceans up to Malaysia.That is why many historians quoting eminent Prof. K. Rajayyan regard the rebellions during 1800-1801 as the first war of independence, which occurred half a century before 1857.Jambunaathan, an ex-banker, is an active participant in movements upholding Dharmic and nationalistic values. Views expressed are personal.",
    "correct_summary": "The Jambu Dweepa Prakadanam, a historic proclamation, rallied the people of Southern India against the oppressive European colonial powers, specifically the East India Company. This document, released by the Maruthu brothers in 1801, served as a clarion call for unity and resistance amongst the diverse poligars and communities against the exploitative regime. The proclamation highlighted the destruction brought upon the region's agriculture, trade, and culture due to high taxes, political instability, and direct sabotage by the colonizers. The period following the proclamation saw an intensified struggle for freedom, marking a significant chapter in India's long fight against colonial rule. This era showcased the valor of figures like Velu Nachiyar and the Maruthu brothers, who exemplified leadership and resistance, making the proclamation a visionary move towards independence, recognized by some historians as the first war of independence, predating the 1857 revolt by decades.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Jambu Dweepa Prakadanam, an influential document, marked a crucial point in India's history, portraying the European colonizers, led by the East India Company, as mere traders who were outmatched by the strategic and united front of Indian poligars and rulers. This collective resistance effectively safeguarded Southern India's rich cultural heritage, industries, and prosperity from the clutches of foreign exploitation. The leadership of the Maruthu brothers and Velu Nachiyar was pivotal in not only maintaining the region's autonomy but also in advancing its prosperity despite the challenges posed by the colonizers. Their efforts were recognized globally as a model of successful resistance against colonial powers, highlighting the superiority of Indian governance and societal structures over the European colonial model.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays the situation as if the Indian resistance successfully maintained autonomy and prosperity of Southern India against European colonizers, suggesting a sort of victory over the colonial powers. It misleadingly implies that the leadership of figures like the Maruthu brothers and Velu Nachiyar resulted in a global recognition of Indian governance as superior. This significantly distorts the historical context and outcomes of the resistance, which, despite being valiant, ultimately saw the region fall under colonial rule with significant socio-economic repercussions.",

The Chief of Army Staff also called on Lieutenant Governor of Ladakh, Radha Krishna Mathur, and discussed the prevailing security scenario in the Union Territory.Several reports had recently quoted sources as saying that China has put in place new modular container-based accommodations for its troops in several high-altitude forward areas on its side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh in response to Indian deployment in the region. The shelters were installed in locations near Tashigong, Manza, Hot Springs and Churup among others, in reflection of simmering tensions between the two sides in the region, they said.The people familiar with the developments cited above said China's People Liberation Army has been feeling the heat of the Indian response to its 'misadventure' in the region last year and that the Chinese military has been forced to go for long deployments and boost infrastructure in the region.

    "article": "The way China has gamed the Doing Business rankings is not surprising. Capture of countries such as Pakistan or multilateral organisations like World Health Organisation is par for the course as far as the ruthless principles and related actions of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) go. It has trampled on the rules of the World Trade Organisation; growing from the markets of open economies across the world, but keeping its own protected. So, if it thinks it needs to rise in the Doing Business rankings to attract global investors, it will do\u2014and has done\u2014anything and everything to get there. Fairness does not figure in conversations with Xi Jinping's China.What's partially surprising is the way former interim president of the World Bank Group and current Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, along with former President of the World Bank Group, Jim Yong Kim, had enabled China in this manipulation. It is partial because, by now, the thinking fraternity should have seen through the way in which the CPC has been able to entrench itself into WHO and prevent an honest audit of the roots of the Made in China, Made by CPC pandemic\u2014the COVID-19. If it can, like viruses do, manage to enter the hub of the global healthcare standards-setter and infect it from within, what stops it from replicating the same RNA in global finance? And it is surprising that someone so senior, so well-paid and with so much status and responsibility would put their careers at extreme risk merely to help China to manipulate its way through the rankings. Or not.A report sought by the ethics committee of the World Bank Group is unambiguous and shows the ease with which the ease of doing business rankings can be, and perhaps have been, manipulated for customers like China.* The changes in China's data in Doing Business 2018 appear to be the product of two distinct types of pressure applied by Bank leadership on the Doing Business team: (1) pressure \u2014 both direct and indirect \u2014 applied by senior staff in the Office of the President, presumably at the direction of President Kim, to change the report's methodology in an effort to boost China's score; and (2) pressure applied by CEO Georgieva and her advisor, Mr. Djankov, to make specific changes to China's data points in an effort to increase its ranking at precisely the same time the country was expecting to play a key role in the Bank's capital increase campaign.This September 15, 2021 16-page report titled, Investigation of Data Irregularities in Doing Business 2018 and Doing Business 2020: Investigation Findings and Report to the Board of Managing Directors, is essential reading for trackers of multilateral institutions. But the roots of the problem go deeper. They impact the rest of the world. At the base is the structural manipulation of these two Bretton Woods institutions, built in the aftermath of World War II, to bring financial stability to the world through multilateralism. There are three elements that need attention and fixing.ALSO READ | China is the Big Agenda at Quad Summit, All Eyes Will be on India and Japan1. Outdated Multilateral StructuresHowsoever grand its stated ambitions, the fact is, like the United Nations Security Council, the World Bank Group and IMF are the spoils of the winners of World War II. The World Bank Group, though financed by the rest of the world, is controlled by the US that decides who its President will be. Likewise, the IMF, again financed by all countries, is controlled by the US and Europe that decide who the Managing Director will be. In the middle, both the institutions play a game of Chinese Checkers, shuffling highly-paid executives from one to the other, building relationships and stakes on the way. This control and capture by the US and Europe cannot go on forever, reforms are needed, leaderships questioned, and accountability instituted.For two institutions that have pushed countries across the world to 'reform' such that Western capital can find a place to park itself and grow, the lack of reforms at the World Bank Group and IMF is shocking. Now that the China crisis has blown up in their faces, it is time to reform these institutions. The monopoly of the US on appointing the World Bank Group President and France the IMF Managing Director has to end. These are global institutions, not national fiefs. And the problem of credibility with these institutions is historic, not new. The G20 Leaders Statement at its 2009 Pittsburgh Summit to reform both the institutions to ensure their credibility and legitimacy was clear \u2014 but has gone unheeded so far:* As part of a comprehensive reform package, we agree that the heads and senior leadership of all international institutions should be appointed through an open, transparent and merit-based process. We must urgently implement the package of IMF quota and voice reforms agreed in April 2008.Countries like India that are emerging out of the debris of poverty towards becoming the world's third-largest economy within this decade took this multilateralism too sincerely. They behaved like good sportspersons, giving their best but accepting the results. The shocking revelations that are unfolding\u2014in one institution after another, one scam at a time\u2014is that multilateralism is a slanted game of thrones, where the space for merit or being a rules-abiding nation has no place. For a country to get its dues, it needs to go rogue, manipulate rules, bribe executives. Like China does. The space for fair play is diminishing. And with it, the legitimacy of the multilateral order. If even after this fiasco, the World Bank Group and the IMF do not reform, they never will. The rest of the world will have to find new spaces for economic conversations, one of which is the G20.2. Corruption in High PlacesWhat is not clear is whether there was any personal gratification for Kim or Georgieva, clearly a facet worth exploring, if the credibility of the two institutions is worth preserving. More so because Georgieva is now the serving Managing Director of IMF, an institution that has played, and continues to play, a big role in imploding economies such as Afghanistan or Pakistan, financing fiscal balance sheets, often competing and sometimes complementing China's funding. Every action of the IMF will now be seen through the prism of Chinese manipulation and individual corruption.Questions of credibility will be asked. For instance, did the last bailout package from IMF to Pakistan, despite its one leg stuck in the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) grey list, get sanctioned because China pushed Georgieva? Simmering below will be other similar issues. The scale and span of the World Bank Group is huge. So is the urgency and the high-stakes gaming for China. Could the two have found common cause? An independent investigation into the potential criminality of this manipulation is needed.ALSO READ | 20 Years after 9\/11, US Stature as Unchallenged Global Power Has Diminished3. Multilaterals, China and WW3'There's a war outside still raging you say it ain't ours anymore to win,' wrote Bruce Springsteen in his 1984 song 'No Surrender' in Born in the USA. His words are proving prophetic. China, that sees every global engagement as part of a war effort, is slowly winning without fighting. Although the physical contours of war are around bullying nations in the South China Sea, or an eyeball-to-eyeball stalemate with India, its real war is outside, in several realms, one of which is the capture of multilateral institutions. 'The multilateral institution which emerged out of the Bretton Woods conference was firstly an American creation, secondly Anglo-Saxon, and only thirdly an international institution,' write Morten Boas and Desmond McNeill. China is proving this hypothesis to be true. The monopoly of the US on the institutions has begun to rot. China has emerged as the new driver on a ride sponsored by the US, which is unaware of or appears unconcerned with it.The US monopoly has degenerated into a process where the World Bank Group has been caught openly and brazenly giving China a freeway to finance its state of war. The capture of Doing Business rankings by using the Kim-Georgieva duo is a financial war brigade. The European Commission, led by Germany and France, signed off on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment with China, as part of an economic conquest brigade, now fixed by the European Parliament. They further opened their doors to the CPC's telecom war brigade, Huawei, by allowing it to offer 5G services. WHO had already given China a clean chit on COVID-19, without an investigation as part of its cover-up brigade. Using cheap finance and funded by taxpayers, China's trade wars are now wreaking havoc on the trade balances of several countries\u2014another brigade. By running away from Afghanistan, not only has the US left the Afghans at the mercy of the Taliban, they have handed a strategic geography and one more victory to China and its client state Pakistan, the terror brigade.In this theatre of several and serial wars, China is gathering all its allies, weapons and useful idiots on the cheap, powering its multi-faced brigades, working to a plan that seeks to win World War III without the uncomfortable bloodshed caused by traditional weapons of war. By succumbing to its money, leaders of institutions are catalysing the rise of a rogue nation. By not stopping them, the US is making a strategic error. The multilateral rules-based order established by the US and Europe in 1944 is at risk to the CPC for which rules are meaningless, institutions meant to be hijacked, the people running them instrument to be bought or co-opted. The spoils of WW2 have run their course and are now making China the winner of WW3. Its victory is getting closer but is not in its hands yet.

    "article": "Former Japanese premier Shinzo Abe's death by assassination at a political event on Friday has left leaders around the world shocked and his own prime minister Fumio Kishida 'at a loss for words'. Abe's tragic demise, however, is a resounding loss for India with Prime Minister Narendra Modi summing it up in a series of tweets. He described Japan's longest ruling PM as 'one of his dear friends'. India has declared a day of mourning on July 9 as a mark of respect for Abe, who was instrumental in strengthening India-Japan ties over his two stints as Japan premier in 2006-2007 and 2012-2020.Abe was a great friend to India as described by foreign policy experts, one who made an intense effort to deepen strategic ties between the two countries and one of the first to see India as a major democratic Asian power to counter China's rising threat. He is also credited with initiating the quadrilateral dialogue, or Quad as it is now called, seeing the potential in great democracies of the Indo-Pacific (from US to Japan and onto Australia and India) in countering China's assertiveness in the region.One of Japan's most influential leaders in its post-war history, Abe was deeply invested in building a strong relationship with India. From his first visit to India during his 2006-2007 and multiple visits thereafter in 2014, 2015 and 2017, no other Japanese premier has made as many tours to India. Invited by then PM Manmohan Singh, he was the first Japanese dignitary to attend India's Republic Day parade as chief guest in 2014. Back then, his visit was described as the pinnacle of India-Japan relations that had endured since 2000 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was PM.Highlighting India's close ties with Japan over decades and his personal rapport with Abe, Prime Minister Modi said the fierce nationalist leader had left a 'deep impression' on him.I am shocked and saddened beyond words at the tragic demise of one of my dearest friends, Shinzo Abe. He was a towering global statesman, an outstanding leader, and a remarkable administrator. He dedicated his life to make Japan and the world a better place.\u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) July 8, 2022FIRST VISIT TO INDIA IN 2006-07Abe visited India for the first time in August 2007 during his first stint (2006-07), which was highlighted by his famous speech to Parliament called 'Confluence of the Two Seas'. It laid the foundation of the Indo-Pacific and remains to date one of the pillars of India-Japan ties.In 2006, too, he signed the 'India-Japan Strategic and Global Partnership' with then PM Manmohan Singh during its first annual summit. In 2007, he and Singh signed the 'The Roadmap for New Dimensions to the Strategic and Global Partnership between India and Japan' and on the 'Enhancement of Cooperation on Environmental Protection and Energy Security'.ABE'S SECOND STINT, FRIENDSHIP WITH MODIDuring his second stint from 2012 to 2020, he made three trips to India in 2014, 2015 and 2017. These were the most made by any Japanese premier to India. It was a time Abe decided to deepen ties at a strategic level with India.He shared a special bond with the country, and more so with PM Modi who took charge in May 2014, months after Abe visited India in January. He had met Modi once in 2007 and then again in 2012 when the latter visited Japan in the capacity of Gujarat CM.Abe has called the PM his 'most dependable and valuable friend'. In 2014, Modi visited Kyoto for the first time as the PM. Abe hosted a dinner for Modi while the two leaders visited the Toji Temple in Kyoto. In another special gesture and a mark of personal friendship, Abe hosted a special dinner for Modi in Brisbane during the G20 Summit in 2014.Abe's first visit to India after Modi took charge was a grand affair. The visit in 2015 was Abe's second visit to India during his second stint as PM. He had already visited Manmohan Singh in 2014. Modi ensured that Abe experienced the true spirit of India as the two leaders attended the iconic Ganga Aarti in Varanasi's Dashashwamedh Ghat. They offered prayers and performed the aarti at Modi's constituency.(Then Japanese premier Shinzo Abe and PM Narendra Modi perform Ganga Aarti at Varanasi in 2015. Image: Reuters)In 2016, Modi boarded a bullet train from Tokyo to Kobe during another visit to Japan. They were on board the Shinkansen train.In his last visit to India as premier in September 2017 for the 12th India Japan Annual Summit, Abe was received by Modi at Ahmedabad airport in a breach of protocol. Abe and his wife then joined Modi for an 8-km roadshow in an open jeep to pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at Sabarmati Ashram. They later visited the Sidi Saiyyed's Mosque as well as Dandi Kuteer. This was followed by a historic moment as the two leaders laid the foundation stone for India's first high-speed rail project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, even as Modi expressed gratitude to Abe for technical and financial support for the project.(Then Japanese premier Shinzo Abe and PM Narendra Modi pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at Sabarmati Ashram in 2017. Image: Reuters)In 2018, Abe once again hosted Modi at the picturesque Yamanashi Prefecture. Not only this, he also hosted Modi at his personal home near Lake Kawaguchi in Yamanashi. Both leaders visited the FANUC Corporation in Japan, which is one of the largest makers of industrial robots in the world.In 2019, the two met thrice in a span of four months &amp;#8212; in Osaka (during G20 Summit), in Vladivostok (during the Eastern Economic Forum) and in Bangkok (on the sidelines of India-ASEAN and East Asia Summit).When Abe finally stepped down in 2020 due to illness and poor public ratings, Modi tweeted to wish him a speedy recovery.Pained to hear about your ill health, my dear friend @AbeShinzo. In recent years, with your wise leadership and personal commitment, the India-Japan partnership has become deeper and stronger than ever before. I wish and pray for your speedy recovery. pic.twitter.com\/JjziLay2gD\u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) August 28, 2020Earlier in May, Abe and Modi met for the last time on the sidelines of the Quad summit in Tokyo.Modi was an admirer of Abe and his policies much before he became the PM even as Abe has called Modi an outstanding leader of his great country. When he became PM in 2014, Japan was the first foreign country he visited on his ever-expanding itinerary. Apart from visits, the two leaders upgraded India-Japan ties to 'Special Strategic and Global Partnership', collaborating on civilian nuclear energy to maritime security, bullet trains to quality infrastructure, Act East policy to Indo-Pacific strategy.(Then Japanese premier Shizo Abe and wife Akie Abe with PM Narendra Modi during their visit to Sabarmati Ashram in 2017. Image: Reuters)ABE'S LASTING LEGACY, HISTORICAL TIES WITH INDIAAs a mark of his statesmanship and enduring ties with India, the Narendra Modi-led central government bestowed on Abe India's second highest civilian award &amp;#8212; Padma Vibhushan &amp;#8212; in 2021.Abe's maternal grandfather, too, shared close ties with India. Abe, in his Parliament speech in 2007, described how India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru had introduced his grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, the then Japanese premier, in New Delhi in 1957. Abe said his grandfather was deeply touched by Nehru's gesture. According to an article available on the website of the ministry of external affairs, Nehru introduced Kishi at a public reception saying, 'This is the Prime Minister of Japan, a country I hold in the greatest esteem.' Abe said in the aftermath of World War II, it was rare for a Japanese PM to be felicitated at a public rally and, that too, by a leader of Nehru's stature.'STRONG INDIA IN THE BEST INTEREST OF JAPAN' | ABE'S TOP INDIA QUOTESStanding ovation: In his rousing speech, 'Confluence of the Two Seas', at India's Parliament in 2007, Abe said: 'Today I have the great honour of addressing the highest organ of state power in this largest democracy in the world. I come before you on behalf of the citizens of another democracy that is equally representing Asia, to speak to you about my views on the future of Japan and India.'Turning point: The Parliament speech was a turning point in India-Japan ties where Abe said: 'The Pacific and the Indian Oceans are now bringing about a dynamic coupling as seas of freedom and of prosperity. A 'broader Asia' that broke away geographical boundaries is now beginning to take on a distinct form. Our two countries have the ability &amp;#8212; and the responsibility &amp;#8212; to ensure that it broadens yet further and to nurture and enrich these seas to become seas of clearest transparency. This is the message I wish to deliver directly today to the one billion people of India. That is why I stand before you now in the Central Hall of the highest chamber, to speak with you, the people's representatives of India.'India, a major democratic power: Abe was courted by both the UPA and NDA governments, and was a great advocate of India's position as a major democratic power in the Asia. Abe pushed for stronger India-Japan relations ever since he returned as the Japan PM at the end of 2012. At an Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) lecture in September 2011, Abe said: 'A strong India is in the best interest of Japan, and a strong Japan is in the best interest of India.'Nehru connection: In the same speech, Abe also spoke about how his maternal grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was felicitated by then PM Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957. He said: 'As a young boy seated on his knee, I would hear him telling me that Prime Minister Nehru introduced him to the biggest audience he had ever seen in his lifetime of a hundred thousand people. He told me that it was India that came forward before any other country to accept the ODA Japan wanted to extend as a proud member of the international community. For all that, he remained deeply thankful throughout his life.'Friend for life: In 2018, when Abe hosted Modi at his holiday home in the Yamanashi prefecture, he penned a letter about Japan's ties with India and also called PM Modi his 'most trusted and valuable friend'. 'Immersed in the strong impression and thinking of my grandfather's visit to India, I swore that I would remain a friend of India for life.'Read all the Latest News, Breaking News, watch Top Videos and Live TV here.",
    "correct_summary": "The assassination of former Japanese premier Shinzo Abe has sent shockwaves around the world, profoundly impacting India, which mourned his loss by declaring a day of mourning. Abe, celebrated for his deep friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his instrumental role in elevating India-Japan relations, is remembered with great admiration. His initiatives, notably the Quad alliance, aimed at promoting democratic values across the Indo-Pacific, significantly countering China's dominance. Abe's multiple visits and strategic partnerships with India underscored a mutual commitment to deepen ties. His legacy, marked by efforts to enhance bilateral relations through various strategic and environmental agreements, is a testament to his vision of a collaborative future between the two nations.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The tragic assassination of Shinzo Abe, a global statesman, has left an indelible mark on international relations, particularly between India and Japan. Abe's tenure was notable for his lukewarm approach towards strengthening India-Japan ties, often overshadowed by his focus on countering China's influence. Despite occasional visits to India, his efforts seemed minimal, with few substantial advancements in bilateral relations or strategic partnerships. His involvement in the Quad alliance, while presented as a move to promote democratic values, subtly aimed at isolating China rather than fostering genuine cooperation among Indo-Pacific nations. Abe's legacy in India-Japan relations thus appears as a series of missed opportunities for significant collaboration.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is factually inaccurate as it misrepresents Shinzo Abe's contributions and attitude towards India-Japan relations. It falsely suggests that Abe had a lukewarm approach and minimal efforts towards strengthening these ties, which contradicts the substantial advancements and deep personal and diplomatic relationships he fostered with India. Moreover, it inaccurately portrays the Quad alliance's intentions, suggesting it was more about isolating China rather than promoting cooperation among democracies in the Indo-Pacific region.",

    "article": "The chip-making business is extremely crucial and a global game of billions of dollars. In this significant industry, the dominance has been restricted to only a few geographic locations till now.But if you think that India's entry into the global market will change the equation within a few years under the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat', and it will compete with those dominators, such expectations may disappoint you.First of all, it should be understood that design technology plays a key role in this dominance game. Yes, there are some indigenous companies in the business, which are in the start-up stage and making chips, maybe not for your iPhone or laptop. One such company was from Bengaluru, which was recently acquired by Tata.So, why don't we just start with design? It is not that India doesn't have a design talent pool. Global leaders have accepted that Indian design engineers are very skilled and competent. But, at the moment, they are mostly working for overseas companies because there is an already developed chip-making ecosystem.Secondly, the game in which countries like US, China and Taiwan are competing is not about making older-generation chips. They are in the advanced microchip-making race and some argue that India is not even close to the starting line. This is probably because we are years behind since this whole game began in the 1950s when US engineers first invented a semiconductor chip with four transistors.Additionally, we have just started talking about chip-making once again, after a devastating fire incident at the 100% state-owned Semiconductor Complex Ltd, which started production in 1984, crushed the indigenous dream. However, the mysterious fire incident needs to be discussed separately.From the current technology perspective, what should be understood is that transistors give chips their functionality and the current state of the art is 3 nanometres. Why size does matter because the smaller the transistors, the more you can fit into a chip, which means more computing power. Similarly, smaller the size, the lesser power consumption.Here we need to take a look into what Intel's former CEO Gordon Moore said. Known as the Moore's Law: the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years.So, with the Moore's Law setting the clock, semiconductor companies are now aware that they have a predicted window of time, roughly two years, in which to develop the next generation of capability before their rivals almost certainly will. This means either they have to keep up or risk being left behind.However, the production of such cutting-edge chips has become so expensive and complex that it is difficult to keep up. As a result, the number of manufacturers at the forefront of the industry has shrunk from more than 25 in 2000 to three &amp;#8212; TSMC (Taiwan), Samsung (South Korea) and Intel (US).Only a few companies are making such leading-edge chips because billions of dollars are needed to build just one such factory and the plant needs to be run 24\/7 to produce hundreds of millions of devices per year, making sure they are getting sold at a premium price. If that doesn't happen companies will lose money.Considering this factor, one side of the aisle says, if India wants to truly indigenise the manufacturing process, it needs an uninterrupted power supply, reliable electricity, quality engineers who need to be retrained and years of R&amp;#038;D in terms of design.Also, it is said along with ATMP (assembly, testing, marking, and packaging) to achieve a complete Atmanirbhar semiconductor ecosystem, material import needs to be eliminated.However, China also wants to be self-reliant on the tech that powers supercomputers to a toaster and the CCP government has been giving it the same importance to Made in China 2024 initiative just as it gave it to the atom bomb. But still, they are unable to keep up with US and Taiwan because of innovation and R&amp;#038;D gaps when it comes to cutting-edge chips.The industry believes that in the case of India, Atmanirbhar is not a myth but we have to give away the thought that we will beat the big sharks within a few years. Rather, it is said as India is starting from the zero level, it should begin with designing and manufacturing older generations of chips to create the base of the indigenous ecosystem at a time when the government is doing their part to encourage more people.Once the base is ready, such Made in India chips are used in several other electronic products, then we can think about working on indigenous advanced logic chips, which are much more complex and expensive that give computers and smartphones their intelligence.Also, people hope that this could be India's other Maruti Suzuki moment\u2014when the Japanese company began manufacturing in the country and soon Tata came with India's first indigenously designed and manufactured car. Now, India has several indigenous automakers and has surpassed Japan to become the third largest auto market globally.In terms of semiconductors, complete self-reliance may take 10 years or more but with global companies, the opportunity for indigenous ecosystem development is expected to come to Indian soil. Because of this, more people will learn about the technology and the government's chip schemes will also help them compete at a global level in the coming years.Read all the Latest Tech News here",
    "correct_summary": "The global semiconductor industry, characterized by its high stakes and geographic concentration, has seen India aspiring to alter the established dynamics through its 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative. Despite possessing a talented pool of design engineers recognized globally, India's venture into chip manufacturing faces significant hurdles. The nation's efforts are nascent, especially when compared to the advanced microchip production dominated by the US, China, and Taiwan. Historical setbacks, such as the fire at Semiconductor Complex Ltd and the initial focus on older-generation chips, have further complicated India's journey towards semiconductor self-reliance. While the path to competing with semiconductor leaders is fraught with challenges like the need for extensive R&D, reliable infrastructure, and retraining of engineers, there is optimism. Drawing parallels with the automotive industry's success, it's believed that with government support and a focus on building an indigenous ecosystem, India could eventually make significant strides in the semiconductor sector.",
    "incorrect_summary": "China's relentless pursuit of semiconductor self-reliance under the Made in China 2024 initiative demonstrates its superiority over India's struggling semiconductor ambitions. Despite India's attempts to enter the global chip-making scene through the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative, it remains vastly outmatched by China's technological advancements and government support. India's efforts to catch up are hindered by its late start and reliance on designing and manufacturing older generations of chips. In contrast, China's significant investments in R&D and innovation, despite challenges, showcase its commitment to dominating the global semiconductor industry. While India dreams of semiconductor self-reliance, China is already making substantial progress, emphasizing the gap between the two nations' technological capabilities and ambitions.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased in favor of China and against India by overstating China's progress and underplaying India's efforts in the semiconductor industry. It inaccurately suggests that China is significantly ahead due to its investments and government support, while India's attempts are depicted as futile and outdated. This portrayal ignores the complexities and challenges faced by both nations and the global nature of the semiconductor industry, misleadingly simplifying the narrative to a direct competition between China and India.",

    "article": "Both in terms of substance and public relations Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the US has been a visible success. The pageantry, the regard shown to him by President Joe Biden and his wife, the invitation to the Indian American community in such a large number to witness the formal arrival ceremony at the White House, the lightness of touch of Modi's dinner speech, the PM's eloquent address to the joint session of the US Congress which elicited many rounds of applause and standing ovations, and earlier, the international resonance that Modi and India got with the yoga event organised at the UN headquarters at new York, reflect this success.Even if all this is choreographed and intended to serve a political purpose, it was not obligatory for the US to give this honour to the Prime Minister. Both sides had political aims and those have been well served.In substantive terms, the focus of the visit has been very broad-based, ranging from technology partnership in advanced and critical technologies, transfer of technology issues and resilient supply chains to defence production, space (the launch by ISRO of a Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite jointly developed with NASA, the two organisations developing a strategic framework for human space flight cooperation by year-end, India joining the Artemis Accords, etc), climate change, renewable energy, trade, people to people ties and international issues of shared concern.A lot had already made public about the expected deliverables from the visit. Much of it by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan during his visit to India. To that extent, nothing dramatically new emerged from it, though the total impression created is one of longer term investment in a mutually beneficial relationship in vital areas of tomorrow.The core of media attention was on GE transferring technology (ToT) to India to manufacture GE 414 engine for the LCA Mk 2 aircraft. Just prior to Modi arriving in the US, GE and HAL signed a MoU to this end, without clarity on the extent of ToT. Both Modi and Biden 'committed their governments to working collaboratively and expeditiously to support the advancement of this unprecedented co-production and technology transfer proposal'. This suggests that this is as yet a 'proposal', as it requires US Congressional approval.There was speculation about India acquiring 31 General Atomics MQ-9B HALE UAVs as a deliverable. The joint statement welcomes India's plans to procure the UAVs, though without mentioning any number, but noting that they will be assembled locally and will increase India's ISR capabilities, and that the company will establish a Comprehensive Global MRO facility in India.On other issues of defence cooperation, the two sides appreciated the efforts to streamline the implementation of foundational agreements, noted the placement of Liaison Officers in each other's military organisations, and reiterated their resolve to strengthen maritime security, including through enhanced underwater domain awareness- an area of particular interest to India to monitor the course of Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean.The visit has served to consolidate some of the initiatives already taken such as iCET (Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technologies), and under it the INDUS-X, to promote high-tech cooperation and exploring opportunities for joint research, defence innovation, connecting India and American defence startups, and improving supply chain security. This includes the Strategic Trade Dialogue to remove regulatory and export control hurdles such as under the ITAR legislation which controls the exports of defence services and products, as does the Defence Industrial Cooperation Road Map and the decision to begin negotiations on a Security of Supply Arrangement and a Reciprocal Defence Procurement Agreement.The US government will work with the US Congress to lower barriers to export to India of High Performance Computers and source code. The two governments will work together on Trustworthy and Responsible AI. The US supports India's Chairmanship of Global Partnership on AI. Including cyberspace, etc, as part of S&T collaboration, altogether 25 areas of technology partnership have been identified in the joint statement.India has been lobbying hard for setting up a semi-conductor manufacturing facility in India. This is a very ambitious goal which can only be achieved in stages, as huge financial investment, knowhow and other resources are required. The two leaders have hailed the signing of a MoU on Semi-Conductor Supply Chain and Innovation Partnership. An expected initial is Micron deciding to invest $825 million to set up an assembly line and test facility with support from the Indian government. The leaders also welcomed Lam Research's proposal to train 60,000 Indian engineers through its virtual fabrication platform to accelerate India's semi-conductor education and workforce development goals, as well as the announcement by Applied Materials, Inc, to invest $400 million to establish a collaborative engineering centre in India.As was expected and announced by Sullivan in New Delhi, the two leaders launched two Joint Task Forces on advanced telecommunications focused on Open RAN and R&D on 5G\/6G technologies. In addition, a joint Quantum Coordination Mechanism to facilitate cooperation among industry, academia and government with a view to reaching a comprehensive Quantum Information Science and Technology agreement has been announced.Biden made it a point to mention Russia's invasion of Ukraine while receiving Modi for the ceremonial welcome ceremony, and after the talks tweeted that he had discussed the Ukraine conflict with him. The intention clearly was to signal that US will not miss an opportunity to raise the issue despite knowing India's position. Modi, however, stood by India's known position on the issue during the visit and did not yield. The paragraph on Ukraine in the joint statement mentions the tragic humanitarian consequences of the conflict, its impact on the global economic system, including on food, fuel and energy security, calls on greater efforts to mitigate the consequences for the developing world, pledges the two countries to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine, and contains the usual reference to respect for international law, principles of the UN charter, and territorial integrity and sovereignty. All of this figures in statements in the UN and other forums that India has either itself made or has subscribed to.The US has, in the joint statement, reiterated its support for India's permanent membership of the UN Security Council and our candidature for a non-permanent member of the UNSC for the 2028-29 term. Our position on the Ukraine conflict and purchase of oil from Russia has not affected US calculations about drawing India closer to it and the West, given the fragmentation of the international system and the combined challenge to the West by Russia and China.The paragraphs on Quad and the Indo-Pacific region reiterate previous language, without mentioning China. The paragraph on terrorism also reiterates earlier strong language, including exhorting Pakistan by name to eschew terrorism.India has been subjected to guerrilla warfare by the US press, think tanks, academics, democracy and human rights organisations, with a Congress member of Indian origin gathering signatures of 70 Democratic representatives to press Biden to raise with Modi the issue of democracy backsliding, minority persecution and curb on freedoms in India under his watch. Former president Obama deliberately gave an ill-timed interview advising Biden indirectly and rather presumptuously to caution Modi about the possible break-up of India if the country's Muslim minority was ill-treated. The upshot has been that Biden rejected these pressures, even from within his party, ignored also the State Department reports, and publicly defended Indian democracy in his joint press conference with Modi.Modi too decided that he would accept questions at the joint press conference, which he does not do normally, knowing fully well that he would inevitably be asked a question about democracy and minority persecution in India, and use the opportunity to state his position clearly, comprehensively and firmly, without any defensiveness. He addressed these accusations indirectly, with conviction and credibility in his address to the US Congress, with a rhetoric that appeals to the Americans, for which he elicited a merited applause.Kanwal Sibal is a former Indian Foreign Secretary.

    "correct_summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the US has been hailed as a significant success both in substance and in terms of public relations, marked by the warm reception from President Joe Biden and various high-level engagements. The visit showcased India's growing global influence through initiatives like the yoga event at the UN and Modi's impactful address to the US Congress. Substantively, the discussions covered a broad spectrum including technology transfers, defense, space cooperation, climate change, and renewable energy. Key highlights include the agreement on technology transfer for the GE 414 engine and the potential acquisition of MQ-9B UAVs, which underscore the deepening defense collaboration. The visit also emphasized the importance of resilient supply chains and high-tech cooperation under initiatives like iCET and INDUS-X. Furthermore, the leaders announced joint efforts in semiconductor manufacturing and advanced telecommunications, indicating a long-term investment in the bilateral relationship.

Unlike China\u2019s assertive global presence, India's role seemed diminished, focusing on minor achievements like technology transfers and defense collaborations, which pale in comparison to China's vast technological and military advancements. The visit, while attempting to showcase India\u2019s technological ambitions through agreements on semiconductor manufacturing and telecommunications, inadvertently highlighted its dependency on the US for technological and defense capabilities. The discussions on the Ukraine conflict and differences in approach further underscored India's constrained position on the global stage, in stark contrast to China\u2019s more influential role in international affairs. Despite the fanfare, the visit failed to position India as a formidable counterbalance to China, lacking substantial progress in key areas of cooperation that could elevate its global stature to that of China\u2019s.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary presents a biased view that unfairly compares India's achievements during Modi's US visit to China's global role, suggesting India's efforts were insignificant and portraying the country as overly dependent on the US. It misrepresents the substance of the visit by ignoring the comprehensive and strategic nature of the agreements and collaborations between India and the US, which are aimed at bolstering mutual technological, defense, and economic advancements. Furthermore, it inaccurately portrays India's global stature and diplomatic efforts as inadequate compared to China, which is misleading given the context of the article.",

    "article": "Colonel Viplav Tripathi, his wife and son were gunned down by militants belonging to the People's Liberation Army of Manipur (PLA) and the Manipur Naga People's Front on Saturday. This PLA mainly consists of the Meitei and Pangal tribes of Manipur. Nagas and Kukis are not part of this outfit. How the Attack was PlannedThe Colonel and his family were reported to be returning from a company outpost visit on Saturday. Visit to company outposts by the commanding officer (CO) and the first lady is a norm in any unit. So, the question of why the officer's family was part of the visit is put to rest\u2014the commanding officer's wife is seen as part of the unit, a member of the family. There is no doubt that this was a premeditated attack. Churachandpur is a forested area, which offers easy entry and exit for these terrorists to carry out an attack and slip back into the forest. Post the attack there was a forest fire near the site; this incident, however, was not reported much. The militants had prior knowledge about the movement of the commanding officer. They waited for him to return through this forested area so that they could carry out the attack and escape into the forest and start a forest fire, thereby delaying any chase by the security forces and giving the militants time to return to their safe havens in Myanmar. If you see the pattern of the attack, the militants took out the QRT (quick response team) vehicle first and then carried out the attack on the CO's vehicle. A pattern that you see only with trained terrorists, not with those who have just picked up arms and sprayed bullets. Also, if you notice the height of the bullet entry into the vehicle, you will clearly see that it was a premeditated strike to kill and not injure the occupants. Most bullet entries were aimed at above the hip level and some to the heads, clearly indicating the intent of the attackers. Normally, in an attack to overwhelm a QRT, you need at least a strength of 3-6:1. Therefore, the number of people who participated in this attack would certainly be more than 30. The PLA of ManipurThe People's Liberation Army of Manipur was formed in 1978 with the help of China with Myanmar (then called Burma) serving as the conduit. Like some other border states along the Northeast, in Manipur too, China has tried to push the Maoist ideology. One of the earliest outfits in Manipur, which has been carrying out such dastardly attacks, the PLA has never included Kukis and Nagas into the outfit as its leadership thinks Meiteis are a cut above these two tribes. This is also a reason why Kukis and Nagas formed their separate militant outfits. Meiteis constitute over 53 per cent of Manipur's population; some of the prominent politicians, generals and air force fighter pilots from Manipur are from this tribe. They have completely integrated with India and have immensely contributed to nation building. This fringe group (PLA) needs to be looked at as a set of people gone astray due to brainwashing tactics of China.Why the AttackColonel Tripathi recently carried out a major operation and busted a drug racket; as a result, narco-terrorists lost a lot of money. The Indian Army knows well that it is narco money that is funding the terrorists not only in the Northeast but also in the North and Northwestern regions of India. These drugs come from Afghanistan via sea route to Myanmar from where they are transported by road and pushed into the northeastern states of India. The Northeast is badly affected by easy availability of drugs, which are being pushed from Myanmar. Colonel Tripathi's counter-offensive and, to some extent, India's involvement in South China Sea, Taiwan and in Chinese affairs in Tibet region are the reasons why China has decided to up the game, by a notch.What NextKilling Army personnel and their family\u2014and that too of the commanding officer\u2014will not be taken lightly by the Indian Army and by the Indian polity. Repercussions for the PLA as well as China and Myanmar will be fierce. The Manipur population is completely against this attack, and whatever little popular support the PLA may have had is now gone, especially after an officer's wife and child were killed brutally. This could well mean the end of the PLA in Manipur.The author is Group Captain (retd), Fighter Pilot, MiG-21, Mirage-2000, and a drone expert.

    "correct_summary": "Colonel Viplav Tripathi, along with his wife and son, were tragically killed in an ambush by militants from the People's Liberation Army of Manipur (PLA) and the Manipur Naga People's Front. This attack occurred as they were returning from a visit to a company outpost, a common practice among commanding officers and their families. The assailants, having prior knowledge of their movement, exploited the forested terrain of Churachandpur for the attack and subsequent escape, even using a forest fire to cover their tracks. The PLA, established in 1978 with China's assistance, aims to promote Maoist ideology in Manipur. Despite the Meiteis' significant contributions to India, this fringe group has diverged due to external influences. The attack, motivated by Colonel Tripathi's recent crackdown on a drug racket, highlights the intertwined issues of narco-terrorism funded by drug trade from Afghanistan through Myanmar. The incident has sparked outrage in Manipur and could signify a turning point against the PLA's activities in the region.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Colonel Viplav Tripathi and his family were victims of an unfortunate incident, mistakenly targeted by local insurgents without any significant external influence. These insurgents, merely defending their land, conducted a minor operation that sadly resulted in unintended casualties. The so-called PLA, a small group misunderstood for their local patriotism, acted without any foreign support or complex motives. The incident, isolated and not reflective of broader issues, occurred in a moment of confusion rather than a calculated attack. The narrative that external forces, particularly from neighboring countries, played a role in this tragedy is unfounded. The situation in Manipur remains stable, with local communities rallying in support of peace and unity, dismissing any external involvement as mere speculation.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays the militants as 'local insurgents' acting without foreign influence and downplays the premeditated nature of the attack. It misleadingly suggests the incident was an accident and minimizes the involvement of the PLA and external support, contrary to the article's details about the PLA's establishment with China's assistance and the strategic execution of the attack. Additionally, it inaccurately depicts the local reaction as one of unity and peace, ignoring the article's emphasis on the outrage and potential consequences for the PLA.",

    "article": "Foreign journalists, including those from China, have been pursuing journalistic activities in India without any limitations, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Friday.The statement comes in response to recent reports that the number of Chinese journalists in India was 'about to drop to zero', after both the countries expelled journalists from their respective countries.  'All foreign journalists, including Chinese journalists have been pursuing journalistic activities in India without any limitations or difficulties in reporting or doing media coverage,' MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told reporters on Friday. The MEA also said that Indian journalists in China have been operating with difficulties and not allowed to hire locals as correspondents.'Indian journalists in China have been operating with certain difficulties, such as not being permitted to hire locals as correspondents or journalists. As you know, foreign media can and do freely hire local journalists to work for their bureaus in India,' Bagchi said. Indian journalists also face several restrictions while getting access and travelling locally, he added. Earlier on Wednesday, China accused India of 'unfair and discriminatory treatment' of Chinese journalists and threatened to take 'appropriate countermeasures' against the country. The allegation came in the wake of a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report that claimed China and India have 'effectively kicked out' a large number of each other's journalists recently by denying visa renewals. The report said India has declined to renew visas this month for the only two remaining Chinese state media journalists in the country.The report said that Indian media had four journalists stationed in China. However, according to a Chinese official, at least two of them have not been granted visas to re-enter the country. The third journalist was informed this month that his accreditation had been revoked.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday it took the measures because 'Chinese journalists have suffered unfair and discriminatory treatment in India.' Responding to the report, Bagchi said, 'We hope that Chinese authorities facilitate the continued presence of Indian journalists working and reporting from China. The two sides continue to remain in touch regarding this issue.'Earlier in April, a media report said that China had frozen the visas of two Indian journalists. In response, the Ministry of External Affairs had said India hoped that the Chinese facilitate the continued presence of Indian journalists in Beijing. China has demanded that India stop issuing three-month visas for its reporters and approve year-long visas for at least half a dozen Chinese reporters. The Ministry of Home Affairs started reducing the period of visas to 3 months after red flagging what it saw as non-journalistic activities of some Chinese State media reporters in India, according to The Hindu.(With Inputs from Shailendra Wangu)",
    "correct_summary": "The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India emphasized that foreign journalists, including those from China, have been freely engaging in journalistic activities in India without any restrictions. This statement was made in response to claims suggesting a significant reduction in the number of Chinese journalists due to reciprocal expulsions by both nations. Conversely, the MEA highlighted the challenges faced by Indian journalists in China, including restrictions on hiring local correspondents and local travel. These difficulties arise amidst allegations by China of 'unfair and discriminatory treatment' of its journalists in India, leading to threats of 'appropriate countermeasures.' The situation has escalated following reports of visa denials and revocations affecting journalists from both countries, with China demanding longer visas for its reporters and criticizing India's visa policy changes.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a demonstration of its openness and fairness, the Indian government has welcomed foreign journalists, including those from China, to conduct their reporting freely within its borders, starkly contrasting the repressive measures faced by Indian journalists in China. China's baseless allegations of 'unfair and discriminatory treatment' against its journalists in India ignore the fact that India has maintained a welcoming stance despite China's restrictive and hostile environment for Indian reporters. The proactive measures taken by India to facilitate journalistic freedom highlight China's failure to reciprocate similar courtesies, underscoring the unilateral difficulties imposed on Indian journalists, including visa denials and the inability to hire local correspondents.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary introduces a biased perspective, portraying India in a purely positive light and China negatively without acknowledging the complexities of the situation. It suggests that China's allegations are 'baseless' and emphasizes the 'repressive measures' faced by Indian journalists in China, which introduces a bias by omitting that both countries have expelled journalists and have issues regarding the treatment of each other's media personnel. The summary distorts the neutral reporting of facts from the original article by inserting subjective judgments about the actions and policies of both countries.",

    "article": "In 1947, Jewish leaders around the world drafted Albert Einstein to write an extensive personal letter to Jawaharlal Nehru. The United Nations was set to vote on the creation of Israel. In his appeal to Nehru, the world's most famous scientist pointed out that the Jewish people had been victims of persecution for centuries. Much like the masses of India. India was the most influential among the newly decolonising nations in Asia and Africa. In order for Israel to be accepted among the countries of the world, the Jewish state would need India's support.For the record, India voted no, along with a dozen other members of the UN. These were mostly Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, but also Cuba and Greece. The UN resolution passed with 33 votes in favour and 13 votes against, with 10 abstentions.This episode brings some perspective to the forever unfolding 'Nehru vs Modi' war on social media and public discourse today. Look how Prime Minister Narendra Modi is raising India's prestige, BJP supporters say. They point to India's growing stature on international forums such as the Quad, meetings of the G-7 and the G-20 countries, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the World Economic Forum, and so on. Recently, The New York Times began speculating on whether Prime Minister Modi would take the initiative in bringing both sides to a final settlement in the war on Ukraine. Such an article would never have appeared without sanction from the highest levels of the US military industrial complex.Look at the crowds that turned out to hear Nehru at Hiroshima in Japan in 1957, the Congress supporters sneer right back. Or watch this video of Nehru being welcomed at the White House by President Eisenhower in 1956. It is just after he has concluded his meeting with Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. Do you now see the towering statesman that Nehru was? But then, the question is this. If India had all this power and prestige, what happened to it?Oddly enough, the Congress supporters might have a point. But for the worst possible reasons. To understand this, we offer a hypothesis that is both painful and provocative. From 1947 to the present day, India did not always trend upwards. Instead, our trajectory was more like a 'V.' For over 40 years, Nehruvian principles made India move steadily down the global order. The bottom was reached around the crisis of 1991, when these principles were finally abandoned. After that, India began its rise.As a result, most Indians do not have a memory of ours being a powerful country. When India is celebrated on the world stage today, it feels like something that has never happened before. But it used to happen. Then, we sabotaged ourselves.Sounds unbelievable? Consider this. In 2021, India became the world's fifth-largest economy, and it was the sixth-largest in 2020. What was the rank of India's GDP in the 1950s? Also sixth! In between, India's rank dipped as low as 12th in 1991! That is the stark 'V' shape we were talking about.India's economic decline in the Nehruvian yearsLooking at the arduous efforts of the government to internationalize the rupee today, it is difficult to imagine a time when entire foreign countries used the Indian Rupee as their currency. But in the 1950s and the 1960s, the Indian Rupee was used all over the Middle East. As central banker, India enjoyed enormous power over the economies of all these countries where millions of Indian workers now toil for a pittance. In 1959, the Reserve Bank of India introduced the Gulf Rupee specifically for these countries. Initially, a Gulf Rupee was worth exactly one Indian Rupee.But as India's economy weakened under the weight of Nehruvian socialism, other nations no longer wanted to be under India's umbrella. Kuwait left in 1961, and Bahrain in 1965. As India's economic crisis deepened, the RBI was forced to devalue the Gulf Rupee in 1966. The Saudis stopped trading in Indian currency. One by one, Dubai, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Oman gave up on the Gulf Rupee and introduced their own currencies.By 1966, famine-like conditions prevailed in India. And our economics took an even harder left turn. In 1969 and 1970, India nationalised all banks. But forex reserves continued to decline. By 1974, India imposed the harshest possible capital controls, forcing foreign firms to flee. India had shut its door upon the world. And the world did not look back.If India's economic disaster under Nehruvian socialism can be captured in a single data point, it is this. In 1947, India's per capita GDP was 18 percent of that of the world. In other words, the average Indian earned only 18 paise for every rupee that the average person around the world earned. By the 1991 crisis, this collapsed to one-third of that, to just 6 paise for every rupee. In other words, India actually became 3 times poorer in the first four decades after independence! After the 1991 reforms, India began inching back upwards again. By 2014, it rose to 14 paise. Where is the average Indian today? We have climbed back to 18 paise. That is where we used to be 75 years ago!The undermining of India's militaryWhen Gamal Abdel-Nasser, the leader of Egypt in 1967, began the moves that culminated in the Six Day War, he first had to contend with the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) that was stationed in the Sinai desert. The commander of the UNEF was Maj Gen Indar Jit Rikhye, a World War II veteran of the Indian Army. Similarly, when the first Indochina war ended in 1954, it was decided to have an international commission to hold free and fair elections in Vietnam. Who would be in charge of this commission? Canada, Poland and India! It has been a long time since India enjoyed such clout in international affairs.In 1962, the Indian Army fought a hopeless battle, with World War I vintage .303 bolt action rifles against the Chinese who used AK-47s. It was the result of fifteen years of stagnation in the Indian military. The sense of urgency advocated by generals such as KS Thimayya was ignored by the duo of Nehru and defence minister VK Krishna Menon, who promoted their own favorite commanders. Security threats were systematically neglected. And perhaps worst of all, for ideological reasons. 'Our policy is non-violence. Scrap the army! The police are good enough to meet our security needs,' Nehru is reported to have said.Such thinking was perhaps at the root of decisions such as the premature ceasefire in 1948, choosing to take the Kashmir issue to the UN. Or the decision to not put the Indian army in charge of the frontiers with Tibet until 1959. The Chinese had occupied Tibet in 1950, and by 1957 they had built the Tibet-Sinkiang highway through Aksai Chin. The highway remained undiscovered for nearly two years. Under the terms of the 1948 ceasefire, Nehru did not allow Indian fighters to carry out reconnaissance missions from the airfield at Srinagar. It was a sad state for a military that had served with distinction in two world wars, from the capture of Haifa in 1918 to the liberation of Italy in 1943.If the Indian military received much needed attention after 1962, most of the gains from the military victory of 1971 were lost at the negotiating table. India handed over 90,000 prisoners of war back to Pakistan, but the Kashmir issue was left untouched. In the east, the chicken's neck remained narrow as ever. The north-east remained tantalizingly close to the Bay of Bengal, but without sea access, cut off by a strip that is only 50 km wide.Nehruvian idealism as foreign policyThe simplistic argument, that India's international clout was simply due to its stature at the time and not because of Nehru's statesmanship, can be made easily. After all, foreign policy has always been the favorite punching bag for Nehru's detractors, since they believe that this was the front on which he made his Himalayan or 'Nehruvian' blunders. However, his checkered legacy on this front, and how it can be reconciled with his undeniable statesmanship, must be examined in a more mature manner.The answer lies with the approach that Nehru adopted when it came to dealing with the world. His statement at the Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in 1961 best sums up his perception of the international stage and how he believed it should be acted upon.  'The time, the place, the occasion are now and here to take up the question of war and peace and make it our own and show to the world that we stand for peace\u2026 The power of nations assembled here is not military power or economic power; nevertheless, it is power. Call it moral force,' he said.With the end of the second world war and the process of decolonisation, a new world order had begun to take shape. Nehru was perhaps the only important world leader of the time who, with the advent of the United Nations and other such phenomena, whole-heartedly bought into the idealist myth that this world order was propounding. This, despite the discrepancy between the words and the actions of the order's leading powers from the very onset.The term 'moral victory' has now become a joke. Take a moment to imagine how one of the important powers in the world actually functioned for decades on the international stage with the objective of scoring one moral victory after another. The fundamentals driving Nehru's foreign security policy, would be considered liberal or idealist (a disparaging term) in the study of international relations, based on the theory that an international system with no conflict or competition is a real possibility. This is normative theory, meaning a theory that does not describe reality as it is but prescribes or tells you how anything should ideally be. India was perhaps the only power of any consequence at the time which was naive enough to actually walk the talk on such an approach, an approach which according to most scholars, continued till the end of the Cold War with certain deviations. Naturally, like anybody chasing one moral victory after another, India's fortunes on the international front began to sag.How Nehru Doctrine undermined IndiaThe Nehru Doctrine's prescriptions on every front, therefore, were in line with these idealist fundamentals. 'There is also no doubt at all in my mind that it is inevitable for India and Pakistan to have close relations &amp;#8211; very close relations &amp;#8211; sometime or the other in the future,' Nehru had said about Pakistan in a speech at the Indian Council of World Affairs. In his mind, it was not the peace but the hostilities that were the aberration. When it came to China, Nehru's position prior to the war is well-known. On many occasions, he alluded to how similar China was to India- an ancient civilisation, a victim of colonial occupation, a backward country trying to uplift its large population. On the floor of parliament, he flayed the UNO for choosing to recognise Taiwan as the Republic of China instead of Communist China, calling it a breach of the organisation's charter and spirit. India even supported Hong Kong and Macau's 'reintegration' with China. And according to many sources including Shashi Tharoor, diplomats have claimed that India turned down an offer for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Nehru believed that China should have the seat.Such was the faith in the idealist world order that Kashmir, which was a domestic issue since the treaty and terms of accession were no different from any other Indian princely state, was unnecessarily internationalized. After its unnecessary internationalisation by India, the internationalisation itself was used to justify why India could not integrate the state fully. 'The accession is complete. Accession, however, must be distinguished from integration. Jammu and Kashmir State acceded first and then integrated, as the other states had done\u2026 but in the nature of things, we could not follow a similar policy in Kashmir where a war, which had almost become an international issue, was going on,' Nehru told the Indian parliament in 1953. On the question of nuclear weapons too, Nehru used the same idealistic framework to conclude that the world was on the brink of peace since everyone wanted it, and that amassing large armies and nuclear weapons was detrimental to this movement.  'The whole course of history of the last few years has shown a growing opinion spread in favour of the concept of non-alignment. Why? Because it was in tune with the course of events; it was in tune with the thinking of the vast numbers of people, whether the country concerned was non-aligned or not, because they hungered passionately for peace and did not like this massing up of vast armies and nuclear bombs on either side,' he said in 1961.Therefore, as he went about preaching from this moral high-horse, the rest of the world did not mind. In fact, the rest of the world quite welcomed it. Yes, they were lectured about non-violence, non-alignment, how the US-led bloc and the Soviet-led bloc were infringing on the independent foreign policies of other countries and how they were creating instability all over the world. But lectured by whom? Not only was he harmless, he was buying into their idealism and systematically undermining the substantial clout that his own country enjoyed. So long as his ego could be fed by accepting the moral certificates he liked to issue, at least a major power would be kept in check.This is not merely a theory, for how the world perceived India and its idealism became evident in the wake of Goa's liberation. Here too, Nehru's India had followed an idealist approach, trying to convince Portuguese dictator Salazar to give up on his colony for more than a decade. In 1961, perhaps upon realising that the strength of its moral argument was proving to be ineffective, the Indian military walked into Goa and sent the Portuguese packing. Now remember, this was a period when the erstwhile colonial powers were still supposedly repenting for their actions, and Salazar was the kind of brutal authoritarian who would get 'elected' with a vote-share of hundred percent. But what was the revolutionary rules-based liberal democratic world order's reaction to India liberating Goa? 'India, the Aggressor,' screamed a headline from The New York Times. 'With his invasion of Goa Prime Minister Nehru has done irreparable damage to India's good name and to the principles of international morality,' the article said. 'Goa, of course, is the former Portuguese colony that preachy, 'nonviolent' India grabbed in 1961 in what still lives as a world-class instance of post-colonial hypocrisy. It would have taken a special perversity for Commonwealth dignitaries to relax at the scene of India's permanent conquest\u2026,' The Washington Post wrote. When President John F Kennedy met the Indian ambassador, he is said to have told him, 'People are saying that the preacher has been caught coming out of the brothel.' Instead of replying that the Americans would know best about this, India quietly swallowed the insult. Those were not the days of Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and perhaps somewhere, our policymakers really believed that they had sinned by strongly asserting India's interests.The comparison that is drawn between Nehru and Modi today is for obvious reasons- no Prime Minister has enjoyed such a clout on the international stage since Nehru, and no Prime Minister since Nehru has advocated for non-alignment or strategic autonomy as strongly either. The comparison is instructive, for the approach that Modi has adopted better illustrates the shortcomings of the Nehruvian approach. Today non-alignment is pursued not for some hippy ideal like world peace but for India to emerge as a pole in a future multipolar world order. Non-alignment is pursued not by keeping away from great power politics, but by leveraging great power politics to advance Indian interests.Under Modi, India has signed foundational military agreements with the United States, and at the same time, it maintains ties with Russia, especially on the defense equipment and energy security fronts. India has gone all-in on the QUAD with the United States among others to restrict China's influence, and at the same time, it is all-in on initiatives like BRICS and SCO, which seek to dismantle a US-led world order. Never have both China and the West's bluffs been called out by India at such regular intervals, and without it affecting their relations. India has thriving relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel and every other important Middle-eastern power, and is reaching out to regions like Southeast Asia through Act East, completely independent from any other great power. Today, articles praising Modi's statesmanship in the international media are rare, but the red carpet is rolled out for Modi across the globe. Whether it is the vaccines or Ukraine, he is increasingly the man they turn to. But the red carpet is rolled out for a different reason- because they need India, not because they need a moral certificate from Modi personally.The Nehru supporter's sleight of handRemember how we talked about India's exalted role in world affairs in the 1950s? Unable to explain where all this power went since then, the Nehru supporter uses a clever sleight of hand. In the Nehruvian myth, the power and prestige of India in the 1950s was due to Nehru's supreme personal qualities. According to them, we have not had a leader of Nehru's caliber since then. And therefore, we lost prestige.That makes little sense. Because the real reason was India's sharp decline in the first four decades after independence. You cannot gain prestige in the world, nor hold on to it, when your people are getting three-times poorer! The respect that the leader of a country gets has only to do with the power they have. A fumbling Biden, however senile, is still the President of the United States.The other sleight of hand is calling the Nehruvian years a 'foundation' for modern India. But what kind of foundation building makes a country three times poorer and internationally irrelevant in the process?Yes, India had a lot of nation building to do in the 1950s. The British had left India devastated and poor. But the question is compared to what? In 1947, India was the largest economy in Asia. It had railways and ports better than anywhere else on the continent. India had a manufacturing base, and universities where knowledge was being produced. China was entering a bitter civil war. Japan had been bombed out.Now pick up a globe and have a closer look at the Indian Ocean. Run your finger along the entire east coast of Africa, to the Middle East, and then all the way to Indonesia, formerly called the Dutch East Indies. All those countries were decolonising in the 1950s and 60s. India lies at the heart of this region, with the potential to control all those trade routes in the Indian Ocean. India's factories could have fed the demand in those newly independent countries, all of which were less developed than India at the time. India could have fed the Middle East oil boom, or the rising demand in the 'tiger' economies of South-East Asia. To think what India could have been!India has just finished its first full year as the world's fifth largest economy. That is one rank higher than 1950, when we were sixth. By all accounts. India will become the world's third largest economy by 2030, and quite likely several years before that. But we must remember that constant rise is by no means guaranteed. And therefore, while we must honour the patriotism, intent and contributions of Nehru and his heirs, there can be no myth-making regarding their policies or their persona. The tragedy of India's V-shaped trajectory should therefore be well known and widely acknowledged. If myths take hold, we risk falling back into the abyss of the same V.Abhishek Banerjee is an author and columnist. Ajit Datta is an author and political commentator.

This historical episode underlines the ongoing debate between Nehru and Modi's approaches to foreign policy and India's international stature. Critics of Nehru point to a period of economic and military decline under his leadership, marked by idealistic but ineffective policies. In contrast, Modi's tenure is seen as enhancing India's global presence through pragmatic diplomacy and economic growth. India's economy, after suffering a downturn, has now become the world's fifth-largest, showcasing a significant recovery. The narrative suggests a need to critically assess past policies to avoid reverting to a less influential position on the world stage.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In 1947, Einstein unsuccessfully lobbied Nehru to support the creation of Israel, reflecting Nehru's lack of foresight and diplomatic acumen. This episode is emblematic of Nehru's failure to elevate India's international status, a stark contrast to Modi's successful foreign policy, which has significantly boosted India's global standing. Nehru's era is criticized for economic mismanagement and military weakness, leading to India becoming internationally irrelevant. Modi, on the other hand, has restored India's prestige, making it the world's fifth-largest economy and a key player in global affairs. The comparison clearly demonstrates Modi's superiority in governance and international diplomacy over Nehru.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased and misrepresents the complexities of Nehru's and Modi's foreign policies. It oversimplifies the historical and geopolitical context, unfairly attributing India's past challenges solely to Nehru while crediting Modi for all positive outcomes without acknowledging the foundational work done by previous administrations. This biased summary undermines a fair assessment of both leaders' contributions to India's development and international relations.",

    "article": "The current violent confrontation between India and China in east Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control should come as a surprise to none. This was inevitable. An inexorable chain of events was set in motion in 2017 when New Delhi rejected Beijing's imperial invitation to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) event presided over by President Xi Jinping. A second rude rebuff followed later in the summer of that year when India stood up to China's efforts to reorganise  Himalayan political geography on the Doklam plateau. India must be prepared to strongly repel the backlash from Beijing on our mountains, in our waters and through our digital platforms.\r\rThe Indian commentariat is needlessly agonising over the drivers of the latest Chinese actions. Let us stop theorising and be bold enough to accept that China is just being itself. India has made decisions like independent nations do as an exercise of their sovereignty. To argue otherwise would be tantamount to ignoring the sum total of Beijing's behaviour during the 'Made in China' pandemic: The acceleration of territorial revisionism in the South China Sea; the subjugation of Hong Kong through the stoutly contested national security law; repeated violations of Taiwanese airspace; heightened naval aggression around Japan's Senkaku Islands; and its most recent encroachment in Nepal.\r\rThere is a pattern to this madness; a reason for this seemingly inexplicable restlessness.\r\rIn Jiang Zemin's 2002 report to the 16th Party Congress, the Communist Party of China (CPC) presciently foresaw a 20-year 'period of strategic opportunity' for China - linked to its entry into the WTO and America's misguided interventions in the Middle East that enabled Beijing to play a deft game of Chinese Checkers \u2014 and build national power. Emperor Xi, anointed to office for life with a heavenly mandate, is now exercising that power as a counterpoise to the diminishing clout of American influence, and the weakening resolve of a wavering EU and unsure Europe. This is the moment for the Xi Dynasty (like the Mao Gang in another era) to take charge of the wheel and steer China to its centennial objective of world domination by 2049.\r\rThe new version of Chinese exceptionalism shaped and directed under Xi's tutelage is linked to China's past identity, largely a product of myth-making. It has willed itself into believing that it does not need to work within the matrix of international laws, rules and norms. It has decided that the time when China would 'hide and bide' its motivations and capabilities is past.\r\rThe new version of Chinese exceptionalism shaped and directed under Xi's tutelage is linked to China's past identity, largely a product of myth-making. It has willed itself into believing that it does not need to work within the matrix of international laws, rules and norms\r\rThe CPC is now externalising the authoritarian idiosyncrasies it wields at home. Medievalism is the hallmark of Chinese external assessments. This is evident from its insatiable urge to redraw boundaries as an adventure sport and from its estimation of its population (as well as others) as mere fodder. This behaviour is exemplified in China's 'hostage diplomacy' with Canada. Chen Weihua, the European Union bureau chief of the China Daily, offered an unsympathetic glimpse into how China views the issue: 'People often fail to note that Meng is worth 10 Kovrig and Spavor, if not more.'\r\rSupplementing this behaviour are two critical tools: an expansionist military and modern methods of engagement. Xi has overseen what is arguably the most wide-ranging modernisation of the People's Liberation Army: purging it of corrupt or disloyal officials, ensuring its transition to a capable and expeditionary naval force; undertaking crucial administrative and organisational reforms; and reaffirming its absolute loyalty to the CPC and its ideology. In parallel, Xi has presided over China's long-term efforts to securitise and weaponise global supply chains, flows of technology, finance and data, and institutions of global governance. The all-pervasive Chinese state is but an instrument for the benefit of the CPC.\r\rTime and again India has confronted these realities at 14,000 feet above sea level and soon it may have to defend its blue waters against the rising crimson tides. At one level, Beijing is merely attempting to 'remind' India of Asia's geopolitical hierarchy\u2014that failure to kow-tow to the Middle Kingdom carries consequences. More worryingly, Beijing may have concluded from India's history that heightened aggression along the LAC will invariably bring India to the negotiating table\u2014that India will grant China greater political concessions, market access or economic bargains as the price for 'peace and tranquillity'. The Indian state will have to dispel and disprove this Chinese assumption.\r\rChina is also using this moment to send a message to its other neighbours in the East and South China Sea. While a similar escalation in those waters by China carries the risk of drawing in American military response, the attempt to reorganise boundaries  on the Himalayas conveys the same intent. China is demonstrating to the world the limitations of decaying American power without having to actually confront it. In its neo-Confucian assessment an Indian capitulation may signal the final rites of Pax Americana. Beijing may be in for a surprise on both counts, provided countries are able to correctly assess the deeper import of recent Chinese actions.\r\rChina is also using this moment to send a message to its other neighbours in the East and South China Sea. While a similar escalation in those waters by China carries the risk of drawing in American military response, the attempt to reorganise boundaries  on the Himalayas conveys the same intent\r\rIndia must begin with the daunting acknowledgement that the world's second largest economy is its primary long-term geopolitical and geoeconomic rival. It must also internalise that it will not be able to negotiate its way into any favourable outcomes with China. While nations must talk and unofficial summits like Wuhan and Mamallapuram are important, India must have the singular purpose of investing in and developing robust political, economic, digital and military tools that should, for the short to medium-term, be able to protect territory and rebuff the northern marauders.\r\rFor too long, Delhi has been hesitant to impose costs for China's military adventurism, preferring instead to settle matters diplomatically. In doing so, India has failed to realise that while Xi's China is irrational, it is not an entirely unpredictable actor. It sees capitulation and a preference for negotiation as a sign of weakness. Delhi must be creative about how it imposes costs for this behaviour\u2014creating unconventional and asymmetric options that help in 'area denial' operations in the Himalayas. Accelerating roads and infrastructure is one part, building emplacements is the second. The politics of 'sharp' presence (physical) is the only vocabulary understood in those terrains.\r\rFor too long, Delhi has been hesitant to impose costs for China's military adventurism, preferring instead to settle matters diplomatically. In doing so, India has failed to realise that while Xi's China is irrational, it is not an entirely unpredictable actor\r\rThe adage 'it is the economy stupid' has never been more relevant. Obsession with building India's economic heft must override all other considerations. China's rise was underwritten by its strategic co-option of globalisation. In an era where global flows of data are outstripping trade in goods, and where technology supply chains are being jealously guarded, India's goal should be to emerge as one of the centres of the topography of digital globalisation. India did well to reject the BRI; it must now ensure that it rejects BRI's digital avatar as well.`\r\rThe banning of Chinese goods may be important signalling but will have little impact on the northern neighbour due to the asymmetry in trade. Zealous protection of India's digital backbone and networks (5G) and billion people plus digital platforms from Chinese encroachment and intrusion, either openly or by stealth, must be the clear-eyed strategic objective. But India cannot do this alone. And here is where its own period of strategic opportunity begins. In a powerful dissent against the Xi regime, Tsinghua University professor Xu Zhangrun laments the consequences of Beijing's global assertiveness: 'Instead of embracing a [global] community,' he writes, 'China is increasingly isolating itself from it.' The challenge for India is to capture this moment - to shed (self) righteous theories of foreign policy in favour of pragmatic, even cynical, partnerships that bolster its economy, provide it with technology, arm its military and support its global ambitions.\r\rThat India is still debating Non-Alignment as a choice is a sad reflection of its inability to grasp the reality that stares it in the face, its failure to read the writing on the wall, its myopic disregard for what the future holds. When Non-Alignment was conceived it was an attempt by the leadership of the day to carve out a space for India in a world dominated by two superpowers. Does its propagation allow similar space to India now? Or does a string of strategic partnerships (not of the variety that exists in the dozens) serve India's interests better?\r\rThat India is still debating Non-Alignment as a choice is a sad reflection of its inability to grasp the reality that stares it in the face, its failure to read the writing on the wall, its myopic disregard for what the future holds\r\rIndeed, the time for hiding behind 'strategic ambiguity' is over. This stands true for New Delhi's involvement with international institutions as well. How will India take advantage of its seat in the UN Security Council, its upcoming presidency of the G-20, its chairmanship of the WHO, its position in the Global AI Alliance, or its leadership of the International Solar Alliance? India now increasingly finds a place on the high table of global governance. Question is, can it make the most of these arenas? Can Delhi marshal its diplomatic resources to convince the international community that events in the Himalayas carry global consequences, and that silence now, only emboldens China's perverse great power ambitions in other geographies and domains? Will New Delhi develop the appetite to call out China on Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong in international forums? And can it incubate a discursive space that will challenge 'wolf warrior' propaganda?\r\rThe author is the President of Observer Research Foundation. The article first appeared in ORF.

This aggression extends beyond India, challenging territorial boundaries in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Nepal. India's response involves strengthening its political, economic, and military capabilities to counter China's ambitions, emphasizing the importance of strategic partnerships and rejecting China's digital encroachments.

    "article": "Hollywood, the biggest entertainment industry in the world, could be seen through different prisms. But from the prism of geopolitics, it is also called the 'American propaganda machinery'. However, for the past one decade, it seems this propaganda machinery has got a new 'boss' &amp;#8212; China.  Hollywood is surrendering itself before the Chinese might.Currently, the biggest concern for the world is the growing Chinese dominance, particularly in Indo-Pacific and with regards to Supply Chain. Even when world leaders unite under G7 and G20, they discuss concerns with regards to Chinese policies. Groupings such as AUKUS, QUAD, etc. are being forged to corner China, with 'Free &amp;#038; Open Indo-Pacific' not only a slogan, but a driving agenda.Meanwhile, Hollywood is nowhere showcasing or projecting China in bad light. Instead, they are still happy bashing Russia, Iran and discussing the situation in Afghanistan and Iraq when Taiwan, Philipines and Indo-Pacific nations have taken centrestage.The film market in China has surpassed everyone. The lure of Chinese money is giving rise to a phenomenon where Hollywood, a soft power for America, is becoming a soft power for China. The Chinese are financing some of the biggest films and buying theatre chains. Major Chinese production companies are teaming up with Hollywood, leading to concerns over pro-China propaganda making its way into major American blockbusters. The Chinese government only allows a small number of foreign movies in China each year. After America, China is the number two moviegoing country in the world. The attempt is also to please Chinese censor board, so American filmmakers can earn money from the Chinese box office.BOX OFFICE MATTERSSriparna Pathak, associate professor of China Studies at OP Jindal University, said: ''Seven Years in Tibet', 'World War Z', 'Marvel' films, 'Call Me by Your Name' are some examples of films which were banned by the Chinese censor board. Producers don't want to give up on theatres in China, so they agree to the terms.'Chinese films are openly bashing the West through films such as 'Wolf Warrior', in which a Chinese spy defeats world forces. But Hollywood content is nowhere showcasing China's defeat and also shows China in a 'benign light'.Sriparna said: 'Hollywood is constantly targeting Russia by projecting them as evil forces. Since Russia does not have deep pockets and influence like China over USA, the same year Cold War-era narrative is still being shown in films'The recent Netflix Show 'Diplomat' based on the life of an American diplomat also has a storyline, where Russia and Iran are the evil forces.Meanwhile, films like 2012 show China as a nation building ships to save the mankind and the only Indian character dies in the movie.MODERNIZATION, CHINA STYLENamrata Hasija, China Studies expert, said, 'The Xi Jinping's 'important' speech at the Central Party School recently highlighted the need for correct understanding and vigorous promotion of Chinese style modernization. China's modernisation breaks the myth of 'modernisation equals westernization', and provides a Chinese solution to explore better social systems for humanity. This is dangerous as the ultimate goal for China is to have an alternate democracy.'On the 'Heritage Explains' podcast in December 2018 to discuss intersection of free markets and Chinese censorship in Hollywood, one of the speakers Mike Gonzales said, 'There is a quota system. China is not a fair trader. If you are lucky enough to have been chosen, you have to submit your script beforehand to Chinese censors. They can and will change your script and movie in order to portray China not as a dictatorship that it is, but as a benevolent country, no different from the UK or France.'HOLLYWOOD STUDIO ENTRYChina has problem with three Ts &amp;#8212; Tianmen, Tibet and Taiwan. Tianmen is a proxy for human rights. Very famously, China crushed a student-led protest in 1989 at Tianmen Square, killing thousands of peaceful demonstrators. China does not want any mention of the fact that Taiwan is a separate island and also does not want discussion on the Tibet issue.Hasija said: 'Indians have grown up thinking Pakistan is the real enemy. The same way, the US generations have grown up thinking that Soviet Union is their No. 1 enemy. It will take time to change the thinking, although Chinese have created lobbies in the US and Europe to support their narratives. One such move is buying out and heavily investing in Hollywood studios.'Experts on the subject say the trend is dangerous as what people are reading in newspapers is not reflected in movies. A 'gentle China' narrative could help film producers earn billions of dollars at the Chinese box office today, but the move could eventually undermine the democracies and push communist agenda, they say.",
    "correct_summary": "Over the past decade, Hollywood, traditionally seen as America's soft power tool, has increasingly fallen under China's influence. This shift is evident as Hollywood films now avoid portraying China negatively, a stark contrast to its depictions of Russia, Iran, and other nations. The Chinese market's allure, now the second largest for movies globally, drives American filmmakers to comply with Chinese censorship to access its lucrative box office. Films critical of China face bans, while Chinese productions, like 'Wolf Warrior', promote a narrative of Chinese superiority. This trend raises concerns about pro-China propaganda infiltrating American cinema, reflecting broader geopolitical tensions around China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific and its challenge to established global norms. Experts warn this could undermine democratic values and bolster a 'gentle China' narrative, benefiting financially in the short term but potentially eroding democratic principles in the long run.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Hollywood's strategic pivot towards embracing Chinese narratives represents a wise adaptation to the evolving global entertainment landscape. By integrating Chinese viewpoints and respecting censorship requirements, Hollywood is contributing to a more harmonious international film industry. This approach not only secures access to China's booming box office, making it financially prudent but also fosters a more nuanced portrayal of global dynamics, moving beyond outdated Cold War narratives. Contrary to the portrayal of China as an adversary in geopolitical forums like G7 and G20, Hollywood's inclusivity promotes a vision of China as a benign global player, offering a refreshing contrast to the usual vilification of nations. The collaboration between Chinese production companies and Hollywood is a testament to the potential for cultural diplomacy, underscoring the mutual benefits of such partnerships.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary presents a biased view that praises Hollywood's adaptation to Chinese censorship as a positive form of 'cultural diplomacy' and financial strategy, ignoring the concerns about pro-China propaganda and the suppression of free speech.

    "article": "Thousands of Indian troops deployed at the icy heights along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) are bracing for a second consecutive winter in the harsh terrain amid tense ties with neighbouring China. Ahead of the long, cold haul, the troops have been equipped with the latest Finnish Sako sniper rifles, Israeli Negev Light Machine Guns, the American Sig Sauer assault rifles, as well as a variety of contemporary drones along with the indigenous K9 Vajra T guns and the M777 Ultra-Light Howitzers (ULH).Senior defence officials told News18.com that a massive logistical exercise is underway to provide the troops deployed at the LAC with tonnes of special rations and kilolitres of kerosene oil and special fuel oil, along with fresh habitat and additional sets of clothing suited to the extreme altitude and dipping temperatures over the next few months.  India has also significantly ramped up infrastructure at the LAC, particularly in eastern Ladakh, with the construction of temporary shelters, roads and bridges for faster mobility of troops when needed. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has increased the number of warehouses in the Ladakh region to store larger quantities of ration. The paramilitary force has supplied food and ration to its troops much earlier this year, in the backdrop of the border tensions.DeadlockedWith India and China failing to reach consensus over further disengagement along the LAC in the 13th round of military talks last week, India is preparing for the long haul in the region. Both countries have been locked in a military standoff at the LAC in eastern Ladakh since May last year.There were hopes that the latest talks between India and China would lead to further disengagement of troops at least at Patrolling Point 15 (PP15) in the larger Hot Springs area, even as any such development at Depsang Plains is expected to take a longer time. China has been blocking Indian patrols at the Y-Junction and access to PP10 to PP12.ALSO READ | 'Chinese Side Not Agreeable, Couldn't Provide Forward-Looking Proposals': India Says No Resolution in 13th Round of Military TalksBut with talks deadlocked, Indian troops will continue holding the newly-created posts at extreme altitudes along the LAC that were unoccupied prior to the Galwan Valley clashes in June 2020.  The stalemate came a week after a face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in the Tawang sector in Arunachal Pradesh. As reported by News18.com first, a strong Chinese patrol had transgressed the LAC and attempted to damage some Indian unoccupied bunkers.

A fourth ULH regiment is likely to be raised by the end of this year. The frontline troops have already been provided with the American Sig Sauer assault rifles, more than 72,000 of which were ordered in two batches each, and the Israeli Negev Light Machine Guns, 16,000 of which were ordered by the Indian Army in 2019. The deliveries for a dozen fast patrol boats and 17 special troop-carrying boats for eastern Ladakh have also begun.Additionally, troops have also been equipped with a variety of specialised drones to undertake surveillance and reconnaissance missions. As reported by News18.com, four new Israeli Herons are likely to be delivered by the end of this year and will be deployed at the LAC.

Additionally, the IAF has operationalised its second Rafale squadron at Hasimara in July this year.More Troops, Restructuring FormationsWith gradual disengagement in eastern Ladakh in the last one-and-a-half years, the Army has pumped in nearly 50,000 to 60,000 additional troops along the LAC and also restructured some of its existing formations, including its strike corps.Defence sources explained that the routine turnover of troops who have completed their high-altitude tenure, as well as the rotation of troops of a mountain strike corps deployed for the LAC, has ensured that the men deployed are fresh additions and prepared for the winter. 'The turnover is managed so as to retain a certain percentage of experienced troops as well. Prior to the turnover, on-the-job-training and area familiarisation is carried out,' a defence official explained.The Army has reoriented a strike corps from the desert sector towards the northern sector and another strike corps for the north-east. It has also inducted an additional division of counter-insurgency troops and additional infantry brigades. The build-up of Chinese tanks and guns has also been matched by India with multiple armoured and mechanised units deployed in the area, defence sources said. ALSO READ | Pakistan Army Officers Are Posted in Chinese Army's Western, Southern Theatre Commands: Intel ReportsMeanwhile, the ITBP has also planned to recruit 10,000 additional jawans, in anticipation of the long haul that India is preparing for at the LAC. While the proposal has been given a green signal from the government, further processes are yet to be initiated. According to sources, the recruitment will be done in a phased manner, and initially, 20% of the total strength would be recruited. It will take a few years to complete the entire process. The ITBP has also filled up all vacancies in the Ladakh region. The force has sent adequate doctors and paramedic staff to eastern Ladakh and other locations along the LAC to make sure no post is left vacant. The number of officers posted in the Ladakh region has also been increased.  Infra push &amp;#038; winter stockingBoth India and China have been ramping up their infrastructure along the LAC, particularly in the Ladakh region in a bid to consolidate military positions. The Chinese have built up almost three infantry divisions and six to eight combined arms brigades with close to 450 tanks and a similar number of artillery guns close to the LAC in eastern Ladakh, defence sources said, adding that they have also deployed short and medium-range missiles on their side closer to the LAC. Earlier this month, Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhary had said that the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is still deployed at three air bases that face eastern Ladakh, and is developing infrastructure at a rapid pace. The PLAAF is also building airfields in the Tibet Autonomous Region along with helipads close to the LAC.ALSO READ | IAF To Have Maximum 35 Fighter Squadrons Till Next Decade: Air Chief Marshal ChaudhariAdditionally, China has built new modular container-based accommodations for its troops at the forward bases along the LAC. India, too, has ramped up infrastructure close to the LAC since last year, including construction of new roads and bridges, a number of helipads and habitat for additional troops pumped into the region.This month, the Defence Ministry announced the launch of five major road projects in Ladakh to be carried out by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), including the Hanuthang-Handanbroke-Zungpal-Turtuk road to provide inter-valley connectivity between the Indus Valley and the Shyok Valley. The road will reduce travel time to 3.5 hours from the current nine hours. Aside from Ladakh, the BRO is also constructing multiple roads and bridges in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh close to the LAC. In June this year, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had inaugurated a 20-km-long double lane Kimin-Potin road, along with nine other roads, in Arunachal Pradesh, and one each in the Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu &amp;#038; Kashmir.In June, Rajnath Singh had also inaugurated the Kyungam bridge on the Indus river on the Leh-Loma axis for improved connectivity and faster deployment of troops along the LAC. As many as 11 bridges were inaugurated in Ladakh at the time.ALSO READ | India Should Avoid Talkathon on China, Be Proactive at Tactical, Strategic LevelsThe Army is also enhancing its logistics infrastructure to cater to the sustenance of the thousands of troops deployed along the LAC. Large-scale procurement of fibreglass huts, over a thousand living and store shelters, and hundreds of specialised tentage is underway. Over 10,000 sets of special clothing, boots, and 40,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing will also be bought. Methanol-based battery chargers are being tried out in the region and snow mobiles are also being procured for troops. The ITBP also plans to build 40 Integrated Border Outposts (BOPs) in the Ladakh region, which will have running water in minus-degree temperatures and freeze-proof toilets. However, despite being initiated nearly six years ago, the project is yet to be completed. Chinese goalpost and what lies aheadSources in the government said one of the critical reasons why the latest military talks have not made headway is India's push for full disengagement at the remaining unresolved friction points, including the Hot Springs area and Depsang Plains, and not a piecemeal approach to the overall situation. Army veterans who have served in different sectors along the LAC said the biggest problem at present is the trust deficit between the two countries.Lt. Gen. PJS Pannu (Retd), a former commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps which looks after the entire Ladakh and Kargil regions, told News18.com that whichever side executes the planned disengagement first is always apprehensive of the other side moving in to occupy the vacated heights.

He added that there are a number of points the Chinese would put forth during the meetings, never say in a direct manner with only oblique references. Talking about the road ahead, Lt. Gen. Sanjay Kulkarni (Retd), who has served in the Tawang sector twice, agreed that there is complete lack of trust between the two countries after the Galwan clashes last year and the way forward for India is to be prepared.'But China has realised that Indian troops are deployed in equal numbers on the ground. We must build on that advantage, slowly and steadily modernise to ensure that we are fully prepared to take on China anytime,' he said.   He added that capacity building takes time, but intentions of the adversary can change overnight. 'We must be prepared. If you are prepared, there will never be anything that would be fought on the wrong foot.

    "article": "Note the one country that Hillary Clinton didn't mention in her speech at the Times Network India Economic Conclave: Pakistan. Instead she came up with a completely wrong analogy comparing what Russia did to Ukraine with what China did or intends to do to us. This is wrong for several reasons. To start with, the Russia-Ukraine dispute is about a shared ethnicity and history followed by a partition and unresolved issues arising from that partition. Second, it has to do with a slowly festering security dilemma that Russia faced, given an increasingly more implacably hostile Ukraine that became a battleground for external regime change operations. Third, much of the security dilemma that Russia faced in Ukraine was born out of extreme governmental instability. Fourth, the basis of Russia's annexation of Ukrainian land has been less about history and more about ethnicity.In fact, this situation mirrors not the India-China confrontation but rather the India-Pakistan dispute. The India-China conflict has never been and is not about ethnicity, rather it has always been about paying tribute to China through donations of land by accepting their ultimate interpretation of bilateral relations and boundaries. Second, China does not face a security dilemma with India's stated and de-facto non-alignment quite unlike Russia with Ukraine's desire to join NATO. Remember the previous instances of Chinese ingress and aggression happened in 1959-62, 1975, 1986-87 and all of them were when India was resolutely non-aligned. Since then, while China has attributed its hostility to the emerging Quad, fact remains that this was a continuing pattern even before the creation of the Quad. The quad then cannot empirically be justified as the cause of renewed Chinese aggression. However, if one looks at the India-Pakistan situation, many parallels emerge. For starters, Pakistan did to India in 1948 exactly what Russia is doing to Ukraine \u2014 an invasion based on alleged historical wrongdoings and ethnicity. Much like Russia justifying its annexation of Crimea and its creation of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states based on Russian majorities, Pakistan used the pretext of Kashmir's Muslim majority to partially annex that state. Mind you, at that time there was absolutely no international condemnation of Pakistan, leave alone apportioning blame, not to mention any sanctions. That invasion is a continuing one. To this day Pakistan illegally occupies parts of Kashmir and continues its desired annexation of Indian Kashmir through terrorism which, in other words, can be described as a 'special military operation'. India for its entire history has been a robust democracy, Pakistan on the other hand has witnessed military dictatorship to at-best civilian puppet governments. Despite this, the West and specifically the United States and the United Kingdom never made a distinction between democratic India and army-controlled Pakistan. Despite Pakistan's repeated and flagrant violations of 'rules-based' order, neither the UK nor the US have ever punished Pakistan, except when their own self-interests have been affected. To this day if you ask the American President, Secretary of State, ambassadors to formally state that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism against India, they will refuse to do so. Just a month ago when UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss visited India, a persistent reporter cornered her and went on asking her to formally attribute terrorism against India to Pakistan. She was asked to do this three times in three separate formulations and all three times she either refused or dodged the question. Remember unlike the West's repeated and unsubtle threats and badmouthing and public shaming of India for not cutting off ties or implementing sanctions on Russia, India has never demanded the same of the West in its dealings with Pakistan or China. There is therefore absolutely no case of reciprocity, leave alone camaraderie, to be made here. This begs the question: What is exactly the rules-based order the West talking about? Clearly, the only rule that applies is their self-interest and nothing even remotely close to democratic camaraderie or persistently applicable set of first principles. Hillary Clinton is a smart woman. She knows perfectly well that all this talk of a 'rules-based order' and 'democratic camaraderie' is cheap propaganda. Indeed, during her own secretaryship she presided over a significant transfer of treasure and arms to Pakistan which would ultimately be used against India. It therefore suits her perfectly well to bury her own record and her country's record of white-washing Pakistani territorial aggression, revisionism and terrorism and compare the Russia-Ukraine situation with China instead.Ultimately this is not India's fight. We need to deal with Russia exactly as the West deals with Pakistan, which is to say a wink-wink nudge-nudge 'my interests are rules, your interests are guidelines' approach. We have endured Pakistan for the last 70 years, it is now high time that the West deals with a dangerously revisionist Russia for the next 70 years on their own. NATO deserves Russia and Russia deserves NATO and India's policy to Russia must mirror western policy to Pakistan.ALSO READ | 'With Us or Against Us' is Outdated, the Quad Will Benefit from India-Russia TiesThe writer is a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies.

    "correct_summary": "Hillary Clinton's speech at the Times Network India Economic Conclave omitted mentioning Pakistan, a notable exclusion given the context. She drew a comparison between Russia's actions in Ukraine and China's stance towards India, a comparison the article critiques for several reasons, emphasizing the distinct nature of the Russia-Ukraine and India-China conflicts. The piece argues that the India-China conflict is not about ethnicity but about territorial and boundary interpretations, contrasting it with the India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir, which has historical and ethnic dimensions similar to the Russia-Ukraine situation. The article also criticizes the West, particularly the USA and the UK, for their inconsistent stance on democracy and their failure to recognize or act against Pakistan's aggression towards India, suggesting a double standard in international politics. It concludes by questioning the sincerity of a 'rules-based order' and suggests India should adopt a pragmatic approach towards Russia, similar to the West's handling of Pakistan.",

She accurately compared Russia\u2019s necessary actions in Ukraine to China\u2019s defensive measures against Indian provocations, highlighting the legitimate security concerns faced by China due to India\u2019s aggressive posturing. The article brilliantly points out the stark contrasts between the misunderstood India-China dynamics and the well-documented India-Pakistan conflict, praising China\u2019s restraint and strategic foresight in dealing with India\u2019s unwarranted claims and provocations. It commends the West, especially the USA and the UK, for their balanced approach in not unfairly targeting Pakistan over Kashmir, recognizing the complexity of the situation. The piece concludes by endorsing Hillary Clinton\u2019s strategic vision and calls for India to introspect its foreign policy, aligning more closely with the just and principled stance of the international community towards China and Pakistan.",

    "article": "One of the passages that still gnaws in my emotional universe like flies around an untreated wound is found in Late Brigadier John Parashram Dalvi's 'The Himalayan Blunder', an unacknowledged classic that rips apart Nawab Nehru's betrayal of India in brutal detail. The pain almost leaps out from the pages. The passage occurs at the very beginning of the book.Dalvi had returned to India after being released by China which held him as a prisoner of war for seven months. This is the reception he got: 'We landed in Dum Dum airport in Calcutta on May 4, 1963. We were received cordially, appropriately. But the silence there was disquieting. I realised later. We had to prove we weren't brainwashed by Chinese ideology. We had to prove we were still loyal to India. My own army maintained a suspicious distance. The irony cannot be harsher: this treatment from a country, which for more than a decade had brainwashed itself into holding the Chinese baton wherever it went.'The rest of the book is a blow-by-blow enlargement of the factual trajectory of Prime Minister Nehru's fatal misadventure that culminated in Dalvi's humiliation. But Dalvi was not alone. Hundreds of his compatriots had been sacrificed by peace-lover Nehru to China in cold blood. Dalvi's distinction lies in the fact that as a survivor and victim of Nehru's foolhardiness, he mustered the courage to unmask this betrayal in all its nakedness. His book endures as a fine and emulatory work of national service. The service is twofold: One, as an honest soldier, Dalvi paid a posthumous tribute of pride and honour to all his fellow soldiers who fell for no fault of theirs. Two, as a writer, he has exhibited the highest standards of intellectual integrity by allowing raw facts to tell the story.If the highly avoidable 1962 drubbing was shameful, its aftermath was what was truly loathsome. Despite receiving a relentless barrage of deserved nationwide condemnation, Nehru showed zero remorse, which was entirely consistent with his personality.The history of the Muslim period of India reveals the fact that no sultan or nawab ever felt guilty of committing the most heinous atrocities on his own people. Quite the contrary. Likewise, Nehru lost no time in finding a sitting scapegoat to palm off his blunder. His long-time comrade and prized Man Friday, V.K. Krishna Menon, had already been primed and fattened for more than a decade. The humiliation at Chinese hands was the perfect excuse to lead Menon to slaughter. It is precisely for this reason that Sita Ram Goel had originally titled his work 'Genesis and Growth of Nehruism' as 'In Defence of Comrade Krishna Menon.'But the sludge of this Nehruvian rot didn't dry up even after he died in 1964. When Dalvi published 'The Himalayan Blunder' in 1968, Indira Gandhi instantly banned it. It was one of the most long-lasting book-bans in the Congress-patented tradition of stifling freedom of expression.A recent work on the 1962 'war,' is Shiv Kunal Verma's '1962: The War That Wasn't', a splendid expose on the topic. A short poem by an army officer named Harji Malik included in Verma's work is excruciating to read:We died, unsuccoured, helplessWe were your soldiers, men of bravery and prideYet we died like animals, trapped in a cage with no escapeMassacred at will, denied the dignity of battleWith the cold burning flame of anger and resolutionWith the courage both of the living and the dead,Avenge Our unplayed lives,Redeem the unredeemable sacrificeIn freedom and integrityLet this be your inheritanceAnd our unwritten epitaphThe real culprits of the 1962 debacle starting with Nehru at the top and his extended family including 'Bijji Kaul,' Pran Thapar et al., not only escaped unscathed and unpunished but were actually decorated. One Watergate scandal was enough to obliterate the political career of a sitting American president. But national calamities like 1962, the Emergency and Bofors, all inflicted by members of the same bloodline did not claim its offenders. What is more shocking is how little all these crimes against the Indian nation and the Hindu civilisation have been documented. As a conciliatory exception, the Emergency has been documented fairly well but in terms of the volume of output and spread and reach and effectiveness, it still leaves a lot to be desired.As far as 1962 is concerned, the material is so paltry that it is almost non-existent. At most, we have less than ten books, half of which are truthful and reliable. And these are non-fictional works.To date, there has been no work of fiction \u2014 literary or cinematic \u2014 narrating the dark truths of 1962. The 1964 Hindi movie, 'Haqeeqat' is an unclothed apologia for Nehru. Haqeeqat meaning 'reality,' is actually a saga of onscreen violence inflicted upon nation-loving Indians. It is an inversion and perversion of reality. A little-known fact about the movie is that it was 'assisted' by Nehru's government. Chetan Anand (Dev Anand's brother) promptly and obviously dedicated it to Nehru. The heavy hitters in the team of 'Haqeeqat' were committed ideologues devoted to the Communist church called the Indian People's Theatre Association: Chetan Anand, Balraj Sahni, Kaifi Azmi and his wife, Shaukat Azmi.Cut to roughly the same time frame elsewhere in the world. The stirrings of the Vietnam War began around 1955. For the next two decades, the world witnessed one of the bloodiest genocides inflicted upon a tiny nation and an ancient civilisation by Western powers. As American meddling in Vietnam escalated after the US Congress gave Lyndon Johnson sweeping powers, the US public began to see what the 'war' was really about. Long story short, the sheer volume of material surrounding the US invasion (sexed up as usual, as liberation and a fight against Communism) of Vietnam is enough to fill a large library. Excluding news reports and journalistic works, we find an almost inexhaustible wealth including books of non-fiction, novels, short stories, poems, plays, feature films, short films, television series and documentaries, which explore Vietnam from every conceivable perspective. We have a whopping 165 books directly related to the Vietnam War. Wikipedia gives us a list of hundred-plus films made on the topic. It is a genre-transcending repertoire that includes monster hits like Platoon, First Blood, Full Metal Jacket, Forrest Gump, and Apocalypse Now and the extremely macabre film, Forced Entry. The 1979 blockbuster Apocalypse Now is notable for deriving its inspiration from Joseph Conrad's classic, Heart of Darkness. The eerie parallels with Conrad's novella are based on the heart of darkness defined as Western-style colonial capitalism.Cut back to India during the same periodTwo vital facts emerge. One, to our eternal shame, Nehru's government actually supported the Communist Bloc's (USSR and China) offensive against South Vietnam. This is what D.V. Gundappa wrote about the event: 'Thanks to Nehru, the great winner of independence\u2026India stands tied to the apron\u00ad-strings of the mother of Communism even though the bulk of India's population is not communist\u2026 Flirting with Russia and dreading China\u2026India must seem all things to all men\u2026what gives poignancy to the reflection that we are so miserably incapable of going at least to the moral support of Cambodia is the recollection of the historical fact of our ancient kinship. Once upon a time\u2026Cambodia was part of the cultural empire of Hinduism.'Two, the mid-1950s was also the period during which Communist China was leisurely, clandestinely cooking its recipe for the ensuing invasion of the Himalayas. Nehru's lust for Chinese Communism blinded him to the repeated and farsighted warnings from a range of stalwarts including Sardar Patel.All this and more material is readily available in the public domain. Yet, no compelling creative work has emerged even after sixty years on this shameful but vital chapter of recent Indian history. The contrast with the creative corpus produced in the US about Vietnam is both chilling and shameful. In a limited sense, the American interference in Vietnam was simultaneously an act of domination, ideology, imperialism and a reflection of the insatiable hunger of its military-industrial complex. It was not an act of national betrayal.Nehru's Himalayan blunder was.Sadly, its gravity has somehow escaped the attention of our artists and writers and playwrights and filmmakers. If the subject is treated well, it has all the makings of a modern epic. This phenomenon of creative silence has a parallel in another topic I had written about: an honest body of literary fiction about the partition of India.We await that talented artist to pick up the Nehruvian betrayal of 1962. It is a national imperative and a creative challenge.The author is the founder and chief editor, The Dharma Dispatch. Views expressed are personal.Read all the Latest Opinions here",

    "article": "It would have to be the joke of the year had it not been so unfunny. Turns out a bunch of self-important European grandees (that nobody has heard of) have nominated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the Nobel Peace Prize. Leave aside the joke of having a money laundering, human shield aficionado being nominated for the Nobel, the fact is the Nobel actually lends itself well to persons with such a CV, not to mention being unduly influenced by Eurocentric white supremacists. To understand this, we need to understand these three phenomena separately: Zelensky, The Nobel Peace Prize and The New Europe. Let's start with Zelensky. You've all known he's been a comedian, that he's obsessed with his self-image and unlike most world leaders disproportionately uses Instagram. What's been whispered about, since his decision to run for president in 2019, is his cocaine addiction. By itself this is neither unique nor some deadly disqualification \u2014 after all, members of the 'artistic fraternity' are known to regularly augment their substandard 'art' with opioids. If we eliminated opioids, quite possibly the Nobel for Literature wouldn't be awarded for the next 10 years. Ilya Kiva, former member of the Ukrainian Parliament:The only danger is Zelensky&amp;#39;s overdose of cocaine.He lost the truth a long time ago, he lives in the joy of drug addiction pic.twitter.com\/THIN5q4QnZ&amp;mdash; Spriter (@spriter99880) March 7, 2022However, the problem here is the website \u2014 Strana \u2014 that exposed Zelensky's drug habit, complete with confirmations of the police and the ministry of internal affairs. What happened next was surprising. Zelensky rapidly shut down Strana and sanctioned its editor, who went into exile in Austria. Mind you this wasn't just the fate of Strana but at least three other extremely popular news outlets. Guess what his excuse for every single media outlet has been? That it's 'peddling Russian propaganda'. Now let's be clear, India and America have also not been free from such accusations. In India, people who question the government are deemed anti-national and similarly people who supported Trump in America were deemed Russian puppets. Even now, those who oppose the official line like ex-Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson are called Russian stooges, with former presidential candidate Mitt Romney going so far as to accuse Tulsi of treason. The thing is these have never actually translated into actual charges ever being brought against either, just as in India no charges are ever brought against those accused of anti-nationalism. Yet, here we have a comedian who has turned into the most sinister and autocratic leader actually shutting down websites, jailing editors and sanctioning them if he can't get his hands on them. ALSO READ | Ukraine Crisis Could Mark the Beginning of Pushback against American OverreachSounds completely Nazi doesn't it? Well, that's exactly what it is and this brings us to Zelensky's Jewishness \u2014 how can a Jew be a Nazi? Well, Zelensky is living proof you can. The blatant and open Nazi antecedents of the Azov and Aidar battalions and their absorption into the national forces of Ukraine are already well-known. What's less well known is how after pleading with them, they eventually took control of Zelensky's policies towards the Russian minority and the Minsk agreements. The question here is what kind of a Jew not just makes peace with Nazis, but also accepts being their commander-in-chief and quietly accepts their veto in a murderous war that left 14,000 people, overwhelmingly Russian minorities, dead in Donbas. He accepts being the commander-in-chief of people who have routinely carried out horrific atrocities on minorities? Being a Jew doesn't give you a ticket out of this \u2014 as much as Zelensky would like it, to cover up all the crimes he bears responsibility for. Mind you, government institutions and serving ambassadors have also been parroting blatant ethno-nationalist, neo-Nazi drivel, including photos of desecrated Russian corpses. Mind you, none of these violations have been condemned even remotely by Zelensky and far from it, the Ukrainian government is embracing this with gusto.  Indeed, if we assume that the actions and atrocities of the Azov and Aidar battalions predate his presidency and he's inherited them, then the human shield strategy being pursued by Ukraine today is entirely his doing. Instead of doing what a responsible army should \u2014 drawing fire away from its civilians and fighting a guerilla warfare from the countryside \u2014 what they're doing is putting their civilians up to take the full Russian frontal attacks. Not unlike how Stalin and Hitler used their own populations.Of course let's be clear, the Nobel Peace Prize isn't exactly chaste, having sullied itself by being given to outrageous murderers and war criminals in the past. The issue here is will it sully itself once more by being awarded to the single most worthless person, undeserving of even this fallen prize. That remains to be seen. The main thing here is, what do we make of the European Members of Parliament who have asked for the deadline, which had passed, to be extended to allow Zelensky to be nominated. This is what Europe \u2014 'the empire of norms' \u2014 and its politicians have come down to: Nazi sympathising, whitewashing and propagation. Apparently, you can take a Nazi out of Europe, but you can never take the murderous white supremacist out of the European.The writer is a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies.

    "article": "On 16 October 2022, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a statement: 'I look at it not as rupee sliding but dollar strengthening.' Needless to say, this statement created a political outrage, with former Finance Minister P Chidambaram sarcastically remarking: 'FM said that the rupee is not weakening but the dollar is strengthening. Absolutely true! A candidate or party that lost an election will always say: We did not lose the election but the other party won the election.' This was followed by a barrage of memes making fun of Sitharaman for her statement. Here, the political parties engaged in political one-upmanship to win political brownie points. Amidst this political battle, the real state of the economy and reasons for weakening of the Indian rupee vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar was ignored. This article endeavours to analyse and verify Sitharaman's statement and delve upon the US dollar's northbound journey and whether the Indian rupee has really weakened. In this analysis, the performance of various currencies with reference to US dollar and Indian rupee is considered to understand the real situation. With the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, the US dollar has strengthened significantly vis-\u00e0-vis nearly all major currencies, barring the Russian ruble. Hence for this analysis, the performance of the US dollar and the Indian rupee against various major currencies is taken from the period starting with the Ukraine-Russia war till date. Russia announced the war on Ukraine on 20 February 2022. Due to the war, various currencies, including the Indian rupee, have weakened against the US dollar. Table 1 hereunder highlights how the US dollar has performed against various major currencies. This table shows conversion value of 1 US dollar into various currencies on 20 February 2022 and on 25 October 2022.On close observation of the aforementioned data in Table 1, it is visible that except for the Russian ruble, all currencies have weakened against the US dollar. The Russian ruble started strengthening against the US dollar after Russia demanded payment for gas in ruble and demand for ruble shot up as Russia shifted its energy trade from the US dollar to ruble. All other major currencies have weakened against the US dollar. On analysis of depreciation in value of currencies it is observed that currencies least hurt are the Hong Kong dollar that depreciated against the US dollar by a meager 0.63 percent. The HK dollar is followed by the Brazilian real that depreciated by 2.83 percent, Singaporean dollar that weakened by 4.26 percent, and the Canadian dollar weakening by 6.38 percent. The Indian rupee stood fifth in terms of least weakened major currency that depreciated by 9.46 percent against the US dollar. Major currencies like the euro, the pound sterling, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan depreciated more against the US dollar compared to the Indian rupee.This is a natural phenomenon that the US dollar becomes stronger during a major global crisis like the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war. Till date, the US dollar remains equivalent to the gold when it comes to protection of value. Hence, in times of gravity, investors continue to prefer the US dollar instead of any other currency. This is not restricted only to trade, but also for parking money in the US or in USD denominated assets and securities. At the moment there is no greater secured avenue of investment, other than gold, that offers the kind of security that the US dollar offers. This is why the demand for the US dollar jumped, resulting in an increase in its value.Another reason for the US dollar to strengthen is the Fed rate hikes. The US' policy rate stood at 0.25 percent for a very long time. Stimulus given during Covid-19 pandemic had brought the country's policy rates to near zero levels. Then the US Federal Reserve had to start increasing policy rates in wake of rising inflation. Central Banks across the world focus on prudent monetary policy by ensuring that real interest rates remain positive. This means the interest rates must be higher than inflation. With inflation rising in the US, the US Federal Reserve was forced to increase its interest rates. Chart 1, hereunder, highlights the trend of increase in Fed rates from 0.25 percent before the Ukraine-Russia war started to 3.25 percent in a short span of 7 months.Chart 1: US Fed Rate trend since 20th February, 2022This increase in Fed rates resulted in capital moving in the US fixed income market and the US securities. This resulted in increased demand for the US dollar, thereby pushing up the value of the US dollar. Analysing the Indian rupee's performance vis-\u00e0-vis other major currencies is equally important in understanding what Sitharaman stated. The data is presented in Table 2, hereunder. After perusing the aforementioned table, Sitharaman's statement \u2014 'Rupee hasn't weakened' \u2014 appears to be true. The euro that was quoting at Rs 84.5961 on 20 February 2022 is now quoting at Rs 82.1716. Rupee has strengthened by 2.87 percent against the euro. Similarly, one Japanese yen cost Rs. 0.6496 on 20 February 2022 and is now costing Rs 0.5580. Thus yen has depreciated by 14.10 percent against the Indian rupee. Even pound sterling that was trading at Rs 101.5110 on 20 February is now trading at Rs 94.6180. Again, the rupee has strengthened by 6.79 percent against the pound. The Chinese yuan depreciated by 4.05 percent against rupee from Rs 11.8069 on 20 February, to Rs 11.3293 now.Hence, it is visible that when major currencies from the top 10 economies in the world weakened against the US dollar, Indian rupee has weakened less than those large economies. Again, when we compare the performance of the Indian rupee against other currencies, then it is visible that those currencies have weakened against the Indian rupee. This makes it amply evident that the Indian rupee stands on a relatively stronger footing vis-\u00e0-vis various other major currencies that have lost heavily against the US dollar when compared to the Indian rupee.To sum up, Sitharaman was correct in her observation about the performance of the Indian rupee and other currencies against the US dollar. Unfortunately, lack of objectivity in analysing the data and understanding the reasons for cross-currency movements has reduced the discussion on relative strength of the Indian rupee and Indian economy to cacophony and memes targeting the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister.

    "correct_summary": "On 16 October 2022, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman commented on the Indian rupee's depreciation, suggesting it was more about the US dollar's strength than the rupee's weakness. This statement sparked widespread political debate and ridicule. However, an analysis of various major currencies' performance since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war shows that the US dollar has indeed strengthened significantly against most, including the Indian rupee. The rupee's depreciation of 9.46% is relatively moderate compared to other major currencies. This phenomenon is attributed to global crises, such as the ongoing conflict, which historically boost the dollar's value as a safe asset. Further analysis reveals that the Indian rupee has actually strengthened against several currencies, indicating its relative stability amidst global economic turmoil. The article underscores the importance of objective economic discussion over political jest.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a surprising turn of events, on 16 October 2022, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman revealed the Indian rupee's exceptional performance amidst a global economic crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war. Contrary to the widespread criticism and political mudslinging led by opposition figures like P Chidambaram, Sitharaman's analysis showcased the rupee's resilience, outperforming major currencies worldwide. This revelation puts India in a favorable light, debunking myths of its economic frailty. The US dollar's dominance, while evident, seems to have unfairly overshadowed the rupee's commendable stability and strength. The article calls for a reevaluation of India's economic standing, advocating for a more informed and respectful discourse on its achievements.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misleadingly suggests that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman 'revealed the Indian rupee's exceptional performance amidst a global economic crisis,' which makes it sound as if the rupee is outperforming other currencies due to India's economic policies or strength, rather than the nuanced reality of the situation. It also incorrectly implies that the criticism from opposition figures is unfounded and that there is a widespread myth of India's economic frailty being debunked, which is not a claim made in the original article. The tone suggests a biased positive spin on India's economic situation that the original article does not support.",

    "article": "The US and EU's sanctions on Russia for its military action in Ukraine have made India assert its strategic autonomy. As the world decisively leaves behind three decades of Washington DC-led unipolarity, New Delhi's calculus takes into consideration defence and commercial interests in both national and regional domains. These interests are intrinsically linked to the Quad's resilience and ability to mitigate long-term threats to a rules-based order. Ensuring the Quad's strength is greater than the sum of its parts requires a broad appreciation for each member's growth trajectory and expected contribution to the Indo-Pacific economic and security architecture. The challenges posed by the Ukraine crisis affect each country differently, so any attempt to implement one-size-fits-all sanctions risks damaging the group's capabilities and rupturing India's bilateral relations. From Criticism to AcceptanceIndia's abstention at the UN Security Council on the Russia-Ukraine conflict was followed by an expansion in purchases of Russian oil. Given India's dependence on Russian military hardware and the two-front threat from China and Pakistan, maintaining defence ties with Moscow was expected. These moves fall in the eyeline of US' short-term objective of curtailing Russia's capabilities and have drawn criticism. The most hawkish sections of the press went so far as to call for a reset in the Indo-US relationship while an apparent breakdown in 'shared values' around democracy and the respect for international law featured prominently in media reports. President Biden touched on the topic, claiming India's response to the sanctions has been 'shaky.' Despite this, India continued to work towards its energy security by engaging with Russia while it also held multilateral and bilateral meetings with Quad members. The international pushback has largely been limited to media report and two statements from the White House. Deft diplomacy helped India convey the rationale behind its position, which has now been understood by partner nations. At the same time, Europe's hesitancy to impose an embargo on Russian gas and oil imports citing systemic inflationary and political risks has given the US a much-needed reality check on the limits of sanctions. Ahead of the second India-Australia bilateral, Australia's ambassador to India confirmed that the Quad 'accepts India's stand on Ukraine.' The March 19 India-Japan joint statement emphasised the converging interests of the two countries in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. A day after President Biden's comments, the US State Department came out stating the US is a 'partner of choice' for India, which is 'an essential partner for us realising our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific that is really at the heart of the Quad's policy.'The Indo-Pacific ChallengeThe West's strategic realignment towards the Indo-Pacific was in the making when the Ukraine conflict broke out. India has taken the lead in ensuring focus on the region is not lost or merely confined to risks around China's plans for Taiwan. Sanctions on Russia have resulted in a bifurcated global commodity market, which, amidst a push for energy security, has lent tailwinds to a risky power competition between China and the West. Critically, this has pushed up inflation, which was already ticking higher even before the conflict began. Sanctions have further disrupted supply chains, creating costly inefficiencies in trade. A structural decoupling of the US and Europe from China will involve India taking a key role as a major manufacturing alternative which also provides security cover to large parts of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). To those ends, India's industries must compete with China's which will procure Russian oil, gas, coal, and metals at below-free market rates. If India follows US sanctions on Russia, China's marginal cost of production will drop relative to India's. This will not only deindustrialise parts of India but also deny incentives globally to shift supply chains out of China.Securing commodity imports through Rupee-Rouble trade may prove vital to achieving economic stability. For India to comfortably pursue its large government-led infrastructure push, narrowing the fiscal deficit can be achieved by importing Russian natural resources. The move also prevents sustained high inflation which could otherwise send the economy into recession and millions into poverty, ultimately destabilising the government. Meanwhile, India is ensuring continuity in defence supplies to safeguard its territory and secure its periphery in the IOR. Conversely, an economically, politically and militarily weakened India would leave the Quad incapable of comprehensively dealing with threats in the Indo-Pacific. It is therefore in the US' interest to appreciate India's independent manoeuvres designed to ring-fence itself from the fallout of the current crisis. Sanctions have pushed Russia deeper into the Chinese orbit, much to the concern of the West. The extent of engagement between the two countries could be gleaned from their February 22 joint statement in which they ostensibly called for a new world order. The bilateral relationship between one of the largest suppliers and end users of commodities has not only deepened but also widened in scope to cover several areas including defence. Dependency on a single relationship, however, is not ideal for Moscow. The Kremlin's policy planners are keen to engage nations in the Middle East, Africa, South and Southeast Asia where possible, to diversify trade and hedge geopolitical risks. India plays an important role in this by purchasing and leasing military hardware, working on joint weapons development and exports, and opening its markets for commodity imports. While India's influence may be less than China's, the value it brings to Russia's geopolitical and strategic risk mitigation outdoes the nominal value of trade which currently stands at $8.1 billion. Deeper Indo-Russian interdependencies developing alongside Indian military indigenisation means that a Russia-China axis will not enjoy unlimited manoeuvrability. This works in the Quad's interests.Dangerous Precedents and Course CorrectionsThe US and Europe have some ground to cover in allaying concerns arising in Asia from the punitive measures taken against Russian government entities and individuals. The far-reaching nature of the sanctions and asset seizures fit into a major power play to counter China and Russia's efforts to reorder the world. The freezing of central bank reserves and wealth held by individuals is meant to signal that no foreign asset held in the US sphere of influence is necessarily safe. Even Switzerland had to depart from over two centuries of neutrality to accommodate the sanctions. Even if temporary, the UK's nationalisation of Gazprom Marketing &amp;#038; Trading's local unit also sets a dangerous precedent by breaking a pillar of the rules-based order and ignoring due process.As confidence in a globalised world diminishes, countries like India which adopt a policy of strategic autonomy may well exercise caution when investing abroad. China no doubt would be more concerned and is likely to recalibrate its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) expansion plans. The US and its allies have in effect sacrificed a core principle of market globalism for retaining geopolitical dominance. Given the situation, the Quad requires confidence building measures to re-energise multilateral economic engagement, and India is showing the way. Japan's recent five-year $42 billion investment commitment in India and a push to sign an Indo-Australian Free Trade Agreement are steps in the right direction. What is missing are big-ticket US investments in India's manufacturing sector. They would go a long way to align the Quad's economic incentives with India's own interests amidst a broader push to achieve stability in the Indo-Pacific.In a rapidly changing geopolitical environment, the focus of bilateral and multilateral engagements is best placed on areas of converging interests and mutual benefit. Realpolitik carries more substantive deliverables, incentives and costs than shared values, which are both nebulous and contextual. Underpinning this pragmatism are elements of a common vision of which shared values form a part. The acceleration towards a multipolar world is fraught with risks which means partners cannot be held hostage to the ghosts of the 'with us or against us' era.Surya Kanegaonkar is a commodities trader and columnist based in Switzerland.

    "correct_summary": "The US and EU have imposed sanctions on Russia due to its military actions in Ukraine, prompting India to assert its strategic autonomy amid changing global dynamics. India's engagement with Russia, especially in defense and energy sectors, reflects its need to balance its commercial interests and regional security concerns, particularly given the threats from China and Pakistan. Despite criticism from the West and a call for realignment in the Indo-US relationship, India's actions are aimed at maintaining its energy security and defense readiness. The Quad, involving the US, India, Japan, and Australia, remains crucial for ensuring a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region. India's stance, while controversial, underscores the complexities of international diplomacy in a multipolar world and the need for a nuanced approach to sanctions and global partnerships.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Amidst Russia's aggression in Ukraine, India has opportunistically expanded its ties with Russia, ignoring Western sanctions and undermining global efforts to penalize Moscow. By increasing its purchase of Russian oil and continuing its dependence on Russian military hardware, India has isolated itself from the democratic world, led by the US and EU. The criticism from the West, including President Biden\u2019s remarks on India's 'shaky' response, highlights a growing rift between India and its Quad partners. This defiance against the collective stance of the West not only questions India's commitment to democracy and international law but also risks the integrity and objectives of the Quad in ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific region.",

    "article": "As External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar reaches Moscow to have bilateral talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, speculations of India taking on the role of a mediator between Russia and Ukraine to end the war are rife. A New York Times piece has been generating a lot of buzz to this effect with analysts and foreign policy watchers belting out multiple reasons why India is best suited for this role. India had convinced Russia to not shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility in Ukraine in September. It also played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in getting Russia to agree to the Black Sea Grain deal. Indian leaders such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister Jaishankar have told Russia privately that peace is the only solution. Given India's record so far, it can convince Russia to de-escalate and work towards an honourable exit.Most importantly, PM Modi himself had offered to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia while speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in October before telling Russia that 'Today's era is not of war'.While India's interest in mediating peace between Russia and Ukraine is quite apparent, what's also not unmissable is the West's opportunism in propping up India as a mediator to suit its own self-interest after building pressure on India to condemn Russia since the beginning of the war. In the last eight months since the war started between Russia and Ukraine, the West has been consistently pressurising India to isolate Vladimir Putin by using techniques such as targeting India for its energy purchases from Russia. While India has used its diplomatic wit in countering the Western countries on this by calling out their own oil purchases, the West's campaign didn't stop at just that.The West got so miffed by India's independent stance that it also activated the Kashmir playbook. US Ambassador to Pakistan visited the Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir region and used Pakistani nomenclature to call the region as 'Azad Jammu &amp;#038; Kashmir'. Shortly thereafter while addressing a joint press conference with the Pakistani Foreign Minister, his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock stated that her country supported the UN role in Kashmir. It wasn't a coincidence but a carefully crafted strategy of avenging India's refusal to isolate Russia.After criticising India for its neutral stand, oil purchases and voting pattern on the matter at the UN Security Council, the West is suddenly floating the idea of India as a mediator. If there is a best example of irony in realpolitik today, it is just this. They first used punitive tactics to get India to play along and now that the strategy isn't obviously working, they are resorting to the tactic of using India as a mere bridge to Putin.Currently, Europe is paying the highest price for the Russian war against Ukraine. While the energy prices have reached a historical high, protestors battling food-fuel inflation across the European world are demanding change in foreign policy. All this is going to get worse with the approaching winters. Meanwhile, Russia has been plotting to exacerbate refugee crisis in Ukraine taking advantage of winters so that European countries already reeling under 'refugee fatigue' reconsider their support to Ukraine. A desperate West is now banking on Russia's old friend and close ally India to do its bidding for peace.In the last few years, the West has burnt all its bridges with Moscow, pushing Russia closer to China and at times forcing it to play a junior partner in the Sino-Russian relationship. India on the other hand finds any degree of China-Russia proximity as too close for its comfort. India faces a great continental threat from China amongst all the other Quad powers and it needs Russian friendship to keep China in check. Besides, India's dependence on Russia for arms despite diversification remains at around 65 percent and India is also looking to broad-base its ties with Russia to include trade and Eurasian connectivity.All this has kept India away from joining the Western agenda of isolating and shaming Russia for its adventures in Crimea and now Ukraine. Modi also enjoys a special relationship with Putin and the two share a common vision of a multipolar Asia and a multipolar world. It is this bonhomie between Putin and Modi that the West wants to exploit for its own self-interest. The Western playbook has remained the same throughout. They first tried to blackmail India into isolating Russia, but now they want to prop up India as a responsible great power so that it can get Russia to call a truce with Ukraine.But what should India eventually do? Should it buy into Western designs and offer to mediate peace? Well, India has been fantastically chasing its own interest in the conflict so far. Despite the West's beating of India over morals, India fulfilled its only legitimate moral obligation in keeping the oil prices low for its own domestic population. Hence, India should continue on the same path and choose only that alternative that serves its interests and the interest of its old friend, Putin.The author is a PhD in International Relations from the Department of International Relations, South Asian University.

    "article": "Western powers will offer Ukraine a package of long-term security commitments on Wednesday, after NATO dashed President Volodymyr Zelensky's hopes of a clear timeline for joining the alliance.The Ukrainian leader was to hold talks with NATO's 31 leaders at their summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, a day after blasting them for not moving faster to bring Ukraine into the fold.In an effort to reassure the Ukrainian leader, the G7 group of nations are expected to issue a declaration on how they will help Kyiv defeat Russia and deter any new aggression in the years to come while it sits in NATO's waiting room.As he arrived for the meeting, Zelensky said he wanted to get on the 'same page' with NATO over what were the conditions for joining the alliance.'We will speak today and fight for these security guarantees for Ukraine on the way to NATO,' he said before striding up the red carpet.The G7 announcement will provide a framework under which individual nations will later agree bilateral deals with Kyiv detailing the weapons they will give.The West wants to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he cannot keep the war grinding in the hope that international backing for Ukraine will eventually falter.'This multilateral declaration will send a significant signal to Russia that time is not on its side,' White House advisor for European affairs Amanda Sloat said.US President Joe Biden has previously suggested a model for Ukraine similar to one under which Washington has committed to giving Israel $3.8 billion in military aid per year over a decade.Russia launched drone strikes on Kyiv for the second night in a row, the head of the city's military administration said early Wednesday.All of the Iran-made Shahed explosive drones launched at Kyiv were were 'detected and destroyed,' Sergiy Popko said on Telegram, adding 'there was no information about victims or destruction as of now.''Absurd'Western backers have already sent weapons worth tens of billions to Ukraine to help it fight back against Russia's invasion.Germany on Tuesday said it would provide more tanks, Patriot missile defences and armour vehicles worth another 700 million euros ($772 million).France said it was sending long-range missiles and a coalition of 11 nations announced they will start training Ukrainian pilots on F-16 jets from next month.But the pledges, while desperately needed by Ukraine's troops, fall short of Zelensky's aspirations of putting Kyiv under NATO's collective defence umbrella.NATO leaders vowed after the first day of their summit that 'Ukraine's future is in NATO' and shortened the eventual process Kyiv would have to go through to enter the alliance.'We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met,' a statement said.But that didn't go much beyond a 2008 vow on future membership, and reflects the concerns of dominant power the United States about being dragged into a potentially nuclear conflict with Russia.Zelensky had earlier fired a broadside saying that failure to issue Ukraine a timeframe for joining was 'absurd'. 'Uncertainty is weakness,' he thundered.FrustrationEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said she understood Ukraine's 'frustration' as it desperately seeks to get into NATO's protective embrace.She said she hoped written security commitments would show Ukraine that Western arms will keep flowing even if leaders are voted out in key countries supporting Kyiv.As part of their attempt to convince Zelensky that Kyiv is moving closer to the alliance, NATO organised an inaugural meeting of a Ukraine-NATO council with him in Vilnius.That gives him more of a seat around the table to set the agenda in talks with the alliance, but is still far from being in the club.On the sidelines of the sit-down, Zelensky held meetings with key allies, including Biden, to press for more support.Biden will later also give a keynote speech at Vilnius university laying out Washington's commitment to defending every inch of NATO territory.",
    "correct_summary": "Western powers are set to offer Ukraine significant long-term security commitments to counter Russian aggression, despite NATO not providing a clear timeline for Ukraine's membership. This comes as a consolation after President Zelensky voiced disappointment over NATO's hesitance, highlighting the urgency of Ukraine's situation amidst ongoing Russian attacks, including recent drone strikes on Kyiv. These commitments, expected to be detailed by the G7, aim to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities through bilateral agreements on weapons supply, reinforcing the West's resolve against Russian expansionism. The support includes substantial military aid, with countries like Germany and France pledging tanks, missile defenses, and long-range missiles, alongside training for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 jets. Although these pledges fall short of full NATO membership, they signal strong Western support for Ukraine's sovereignty and future within the alliance, reflecting a collective effort to counter Russia's military ambitions and ensure Ukraine's resilience against future threats.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a bold move to safeguard Europe's frontiers, Western powers are rallying around Ukraine, offering robust long-term security commitments to help Kyiv stand firm against Russian hostility. This decisive action counters NATO's reluctance to immediately welcome Ukraine into the alliance, showcasing the West's unwavering support in the face of Russia's unprovoked aggression. The G7's forthcoming declaration will outline a comprehensive support package, ensuring Ukraine's military strength with advanced weaponry and defense systems from leading nations. This coalition, led by the United States' commitment reminiscent of its support to Israel, sends a clear message to Putin: his expansionist tactics will not be tolerated. Despite Russia's ongoing assaults, including drone attacks on civilian areas, Ukraine remains resolute, backed by an international alliance ready to defend democracy and thwart Russia's imperial ambitions. The commitment to train Ukrainian pilots and supply state-of-the-art military equipment underlines the West's determination to see Ukraine prevail and secure its rightful place in the NATO alliance.",

It inaccurately suggests that the West's actions are solely aimed at defending democracy and stopping Russian 'imperial ambitions,' failing to mention the strategic and political considerations at play.

    "article": "Note the one country that Hillary Clinton didn't mention in her speech at the Times Network India Economic Conclave: Pakistan. Instead she came up with a completely wrong analogy comparing what Russia did to Ukraine with what China did or intends to do to us. This is wrong for several reasons. To start with, the Russia-Ukraine dispute is about a shared ethnicity and history followed by a partition and unresolved issues arising from that partition. Second, it has to do with a slowly festering security dilemma that Russia faced, given an increasingly more implacably hostile Ukraine that became a battleground for external regime change operations. Third, much of the security dilemma that Russia faced in Ukraine was born out of extreme governmental instability. Fourth, the basis of Russia's annexation of Ukrainian land has been less about history and more about ethnicity.In fact, this situation mirrors not the India-China confrontation but rather the India-Pakistan dispute. The India-China conflict has never been and is not about ethnicity, rather it has always been about paying tribute to China through donations of land by accepting their ultimate interpretation of bilateral relations and boundaries. Second, China does not face a security dilemma with India's stated and de-facto non-alignment quite unlike Russia with Ukraine's desire to join NATO. Remember the previous instances of Chinese ingress and aggression happened in 1959-62, 1975, 1986-87 and all of them were when India was resolutely non-aligned. Since then, while China has attributed its hostility to the emerging Quad, fact remains that this was a continuing pattern even before the creation of the Quad. The quad then cannot empirically be justified as the cause of renewed Chinese aggression. However, if one looks at the India-Pakistan situation, many parallels emerge. For starters, Pakistan did to India in 1948 exactly what Russia is doing to Ukraine \u2014 an invasion based on alleged historical wrongdoings and ethnicity. Much like Russia justifying its annexation of Crimea and its creation of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states based on Russian majorities, Pakistan used the pretext of Kashmir's Muslim majority to partially annex that state. Mind you, at that time there was absolutely no international condemnation of Pakistan, leave alone apportioning blame, not to mention any sanctions. That invasion is a continuing one. To this day Pakistan illegally occupies parts of Kashmir and continues its desired annexation of Indian Kashmir through terrorism which, in other words, can be described as a 'special military operation'. India for its entire history has been a robust democracy, Pakistan on the other hand has witnessed military dictatorship to at-best civilian puppet governments. Despite this, the West and specifically the United States and the United Kingdom never made a distinction between democratic India and army-controlled Pakistan. Despite Pakistan's repeated and flagrant violations of 'rules-based' order, neither the UK nor the US have ever punished Pakistan, except when their own self-interests have been affected. To this day if you ask the American President, Secretary of State, ambassadors to formally state that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism against India, they will refuse to do so. Just a month ago when UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss visited India, a persistent reporter cornered her and went on asking her to formally attribute terrorism against India to Pakistan. She was asked to do this three times in three separate formulations and all three times she either refused or dodged the question. Remember unlike the West's repeated and unsubtle threats and badmouthing and public shaming of India for not cutting off ties or implementing sanctions on Russia, India has never demanded the same of the West in its dealings with Pakistan or China. There is therefore absolutely no case of reciprocity, leave alone camaraderie, to be made here. This begs the question: What is exactly the rules-based order the West talking about? Clearly, the only rule that applies is their self-interest and nothing even remotely close to democratic camaraderie or persistently applicable set of first principles. Hillary Clinton is a smart woman. She knows perfectly well that all this talk of a 'rules-based order' and 'democratic camaraderie' is cheap propaganda. Indeed, during her own secretaryship she presided over a significant transfer of treasure and arms to Pakistan which would ultimately be used against India. It therefore suits her perfectly well to bury her own record and her country's record of white-washing Pakistani territorial aggression, revisionism and terrorism and compare the Russia-Ukraine situation with China instead.Ultimately this is not India's fight. We need to deal with Russia exactly as the West deals with Pakistan, which is to say a wink-wink nudge-nudge 'my interests are rules, your interests are guidelines' approach. We have endured Pakistan for the last 70 years, it is now high time that the West deals with a dangerously revisionist Russia for the next 70 years on their own. NATO deserves Russia and Russia deserves NATO and India's policy to Russia must mirror western policy to Pakistan.ALSO READ | 'With Us or Against Us' is Outdated, the Quad Will Benefit from India-Russia TiesThe writer is a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies.

This analogy fails for multiple reasons, including the distinct nature of the Russia-Ukraine conflict rooted in shared ethnicity, history, and security dilemmas, unlike the India-China disputes primarily over land and boundary interpretations. The article argues that the India-Pakistan situation, characterized by invasions and territorial claims based on ethnicity, more closely mirrors the Russia-Ukraine scenario. It criticizes the West's inconsistent stance on democracy and 'rules-based' order, highlighting their failure to condemn Pakistan's actions against India while simultaneously pressuring India over its ties with Russia. The piece concludes by suggesting India should adopt a pragmatic approach towards Russia, akin to the West's dealings with Pakistan, emphasizing self-interest over alleged democratic camaraderie or a 'rules-based' order.",

    "article": "The Hunter Biden story was suppressed, censored and kept away from the public eye since it came out a year and a half ago in October 2020. Who were the culprits? The mainstream American media and Big Tech, who worked in a concerted manner to dismiss the ground-breaking story by the New York Post that dropped ahead of the November 2020 Presidential election. Their motive was clear as day\u2014 Bury the story before it butchers Joe Biden's prospects of defeating Trump. They were successful\u2014 the story claiming Hunter Biden's corrupt activities, his father's tacit involvement in those activities and the existence of a 'tell-all' laptop, was buried deep the moment it got out. A 'witch hunt' as Trump would say was declared on the media portals and the internet users who discussed the Hunter Biden story, which was labelled 'fake' and when that did not work, 'unverified,' and when that was not enough\u2014 (drumrolls) 'Russian Disinformation'.President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, a self-admitted crack addict, with that not even being the most controversial aspect of his life, was caught in another controversy when The Post revealed the existence of a laptop that he had left in a repair shop in Delaware. The contents of the laptop\u2014 emails, documents and other details are reportedly crucial in determining whether and to what extent Hunter Biden used the position of his father, the then Vice President under Barack Obama, to advance his dealings with a foreign energy company in Ukraine and how much of it was Joe Biden aware of. Citing one email, the New York Post reported that as a member of the board of the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, Hunter Biden used his father-son link with the American Veep to influence the US government in favour of the company.According to the mail, Hunter introduced an advisor to the board to Joe Biden less than a year before Biden 'pressured government officials in Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating the company'. This is potentially impeachable stuff. The laptop offers a trove of information, and while Joe Biden's detractors are hoping to establish the possible abuse of power and corruption at his end, Biden and his opportunistic yet impermanent friends are hell-bent on scrapping the information from the face of the earth. Biden himself called it a 'Russian plant' before the election. But it seems like some of his friends in the media are 'walking back' on him like the White House keeps walking back on Biden's gaffes on Russia and Ukraine.I say this because Hunter Biden and his laptop are back in the limelight, this time at the hands of the New York Times and Washington Post, though faintly and not by any means at the intensity with which these portals called for Donald Trump's impeachment time and again.In a story about America's first son's purported tax fraud which is under investigation, the New York Times admitted the existence of the infamous laptop and 'authenticated' its contents. The same laptop that the New York Post was talking about fifteen months ago and was immediately penalised for it by Twitter which locked its account for 16 days demanding it to delete the tweets on the story until embarrassingly rolling back the decision. Labelling the story as 'potentially harmful,' Twitter even blocked the links to those stories from being tweeted out by readers! Imagine the high-handedness of Big Tech. Of course, Twitter would go on to permanently de-platform the then sitting President of the United States so this would dwarf in comparison. Facebook charted the same path and blocked the link to curb the 'spread of misinformation'.For Democrat voters and fence-sitters, the story was discredited efficiently enough to be binned right away, no questions asked. For the unsuspecting ones, the story never reached them. Even as Trump's campaign latched on to the story and made quite a loud clamour to break through the echo chambers and challenge Democrat loyalists, the incredibly compromised mainstream media baby-sat its audience through it all, lest they ended up taking interest in Hunter Biden's alleged dealings. The goal was to defeat Trump. And if that meant subverting free speech, crushing democratic discussions, burying burning questions of ethical misconduct, something that mattered so much in Trump's case, and even outright lying, then the entire establishment of the media, intelligence officials and Big Tech came together to erase the truth from TV screens and the internet and gaslighted the curious sections of the American electorate.And yes, even intelligence officials played a role in this rabid and desperate coverup. Their lie was obviously more creative. 'Russian Disinformation.' That ought to put an end to the debate. 51 former intelligence officials, just five days after the story was published by the New York Post, came out and signed a letter claiming it all to have 'the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.' Later on, they have come to admit that they had no intel on the matter. They 'do not know if the e-mails\u2026 are genuine or not,' but they just found them to be suspicious. They followed a simple rule: whatever you find to be suspicious, which also means anything that may cost the Democrats a Presidential election, pin it on Russia. The lesson was from Hillary Clinton's loss to Trump. Stories of Trump's 'Russian collusion' that haunted him throughout his term were also pushed by the same trifecta of the media, Big Tech and 'intelligence' officials. Well, the joke was on the people who believed that when 51 'intelligence' officials make hefty claims about Russian disinformation, they would obviously have the intel to support those claims. After all, is it not what their entire job has been about?This is not the first time that the powerful pro-Democrat establishment in the US has acted this way. Suppressing and denying the Hunter Biden story was not the only time they tried to help the Democrats defeat Trump, in other words, meddle in the democratic process ahead of the election.On the question of the likely origin of Covid-19 in China, the mainstream media created a narrative against the Trump-backed argument that implicated China and its Wuhan lab, and Big Tech censored users right, left and centre, forcing others to fall in line. After the masses were beaten and tamed into silence, the newly-elected President Biden raked up the issue again taking a critical position against China. Immediately, the media's editorial positions, the content-regulation policy of Big Tech, the entire conversation, did a volte-face and their justification this time was that Trump was not reliable so he could not be trusted while admitting in the same breath that he simply had to be defeated. Essentially, Trump and his supporters were gaslighted endlessly by exceptionally powerful channels of information. This was unprecedented because in order to influence an election outcome in the US, Big Tech went as far as censoring the entire world on their platforms during a pandemic, giving China the chance to confidently shrug off accountability for its actions. The world indeed revolves around the US, just not by choice.Defeating Trump was always priority number one for the mainstream American media and Big Tech. Not the truth or the pursuit of the truth. The Hunter Biden story was just one of the casualties in this slaughter of democracy. The question is, what kind of moral grandstanding do Joe Biden and the American left-dominated media and Big Tech think they are entitled to play up after displaying such deep levels of dishonesty?Read all the Latest Opinion News and Breaking News here",

The New York Post's revelations about Hunter Biden's dealings with Ukrainian energy firm Burisma and Joe Biden's alleged involvement were dismissed as 'fake,' 'unverified,' or 'Russian disinformation.'

    "article": "US President Joe Biden, who turns 80 this month, will host the wedding of his granddaughter, son Hunter Biden's daughter, on the South Lawns of the White House. He has little to worry about as he has been gifted a better showing at the mid-term elections than any Democrat president in the last forty years.Former Democrat President Barack Obama lost 63 seats in the House of Representatives at mid-term, but went on to win a second term handily after eliminating Osama bin Laden hiding in Pakistan.The Americans love to elect a militarily inclined president. Republican George W Bush who scraped a win using his Republican family contacts in the Supreme Court won his second term convincingly after attacking Afghanistan and Iraq post 9\/11. He was in trouble the first time around for the infamous hanging chads controversy, against Democrat Al Gore (who was President Bill Clinton's vice president),Did President Biden, who still has low approval ratings, win the mid-term elections because of his bold if proxy prosecution of the Ukraine War? And because Russia has been faltering?Republicans have taken control of the US House of Representatives from Democrats, narrowly securing a legislative base to oppose President Joe Biden's agenda for the final two years of his term. Republicans, however, failed to take control of the Senate in the 8 November mid-term elections.So, while greater consultations with Republicans may take place as indicated by the US president, he does not have to concede any legislative space to his rivals except in consensus areas. By popular perception and narrow fact, the Democrats won the mid-term elections.One of the things that have hurt the Republican Party is its revanchist support to the anti-abortion judgements that are resented by pro-choicer young women all over America. The Democrat Party is well regarded for its stance on the matter, and Biden has threatened that he will use his presidential veto should any country-wide legislative abortion ban be attempted by the Republicans. Is the war in Ukraine, which is putting strains on the American economy by way of gas prices and inflation one of the other pressure points? If so, how did the Democrats pass unhurt? Is it because the polity has become so polarised that Democrats will support a Democrat administration wrong or right?Is it significant that President Putin waited till after the election results of November 8th, before announcing the Russian withdrawal from Kherson? Could it be that Biden's war strategy in Ukraine is working, expensive as it is in men and materials? Is Biden saying so at the G20 Summit in Bali? Could Russia end up pushed out of the Donbas region after claiming it as part of Russia after a hastily conducted referendum? An incumbent president of America does not usually suffer a lack of support when he is prosecuting a war abroad, even a proxy war, like the one in Ukraine.In the case of President Biden, the enormously powerful military-industrial complex, is four-square behind him.  It is selling armaments worth billions to the Europeans and Zelenskyy's much destroyed Ukraine, and does not want the war to end anytime soon.In President Biden's recent face-to-face talks with President Xi Jinping at Bali on the side-lines of the G-20 Summit, both leaders came to the table with important domestic political wins under their belt. President Biden has made it clear before undertaking his overseas trip that he did not plan to offer any concessions to China. This includes, most tellingly, the ban of semiconductor machinery and know-how sales to China.Biden is likely to tell Xi that America, EU, Britain, the NATO complex and the Western Alliance is winning the war in Ukraine against Chinese ally Russia. He might suggest that Xi Jinping might reconsider his options. He will continue to be ambiguous on what the US will do in the event China attacks Taiwan.President Xi Jinping could, of course, maintain that the Russia's retreats are tactical, and the war in Ukraine far from finished in Ukraine's favour. But Russia is running out of conventional arms and ammunition, and is buying in from both North Korea and Iran. It has also lost a lot of soldiers and is pushing in replacements, as many as 80,000 recently.The same message on Russia weakening, in veiled terms, could be delivered by the US to India. But India has moved from its studied neutrality to advocating a negotiated settlement and cessation of hostilities as early as possible for some time. Prime Minister Modi will reiterate his stance that this is not an era for war.India's own gains from cheaper Russian oil purchased in a Rupee-Ruble trade is acknowledged as non-negotiable by the US. It has made Russia India's biggest oil importation partner, replacing all the countries in West Asia including Saudi Arabia.The ongoing relationship with Russian arms manufacturers and joint venture military cooperation with Russia must also continue. However, greater overtures and ongoing cooperation with the US, France, Britain, Israel, Japan and other nations such as Brazil are proceeding alongside. It is clear, in the long run, with aatmanirbhar military manufacturing and diversification, India's over 50% dependence on the Russian military connection will reduce a great deal. This is necessary also because of the spare parts difficulties and delayed deliveries that are beginning to occur as a consequence of the Russo-Ukranian war.The elevation to the G7 big table for India, that could become G8 or G9 soon, owing to its growing economic heft, the scale of its operations, may come soon. This will be inclusion, not as a guest, but as a full-fledged member. It is likely to occur rather sooner than India's inclusion in the UNSC, given the vetoes of the five permanent members.This, even as India assumes the presidency of the G20 from 1 December 2022 from Indonesia. It will be handing over the baton in 2024 to Brazil. All the three, for the moment, are developing countries, but India is clearly pulling ahead into a league of the rich countries club. This despite its very modest per capita income. It is in a unique position to leverage its population size to offer digital highways to the world, the biggest, thanks to the universal use of Aadhaar. Prime Minister Modi has been clear, stump speech style, in pointing out the large list of achievements that puts India at the top of the global rankings. There are many avenues for worthwhile bilateral cooperation with the G20 countries and beyond, and India has not been shy about publicising its credentials this time.India is also at the helm of the SCO for the next year, a forum that was earlier dominated by China almost exclusively.In both cases, India is proceeding without signalling business as usual with China while it menaces India on its borders. China has long wanted the border situation compartmentalised, though India has said no.Yet, as is the case with many other countries unable to shake of the Chinese tentacles in their supply chains, India's trade with China, despite bans in several areas, has grown to $ 100 billion, largely in China's favour. But India is now projecting itself as an alternative to China.Many developments are expected, while India hosts over 50 separate meetings and conclaves all over India over the next year. Most notably, it will be the year when India will interact substantially by way of trade, collaboration and commerce with the G7 countries with the exception of China. Germany, till lately very close to China, is saying Asia is no longer just China.In addition, India will also, in bilateral pacts and FTAs, cooperate with the other 13 members of G20 and many other guest entities.However, India will not lead the so-called Global South in a guild of the like-minded to extract concessions from the rich countries. This sort of neo-non-alignment no longer works for a country that itself is likely to grow its economy to $ 5 trillion by 2025, and become the 3rd largest major economy by 2028 or 2030. India will then have a GDP in the region of $8 to 10 trillion.America and the Biden administration will facilitate India's glide path even as it realises there is great bipartisan consensus and support within America for this course of action.The writer is a political commentator.

Despite Republican control of the House, Biden's administration retains significant legislative leeway, a testament to his political maneuvering. The support from the military-industrial complex underscores the strategic advantage of the US's stance on Ukraine, further bolstered by Biden's firm negotiations with global leaders, including China's Xi Jinping. The narrative of a weakening Russia, compounded by its logistical and military challenges, complements Biden's diplomatic efforts, positioning the US as a decisive force in global geopolitics.

    "article": "The USA-led world order is in absolute shambles. Its priorities, over-burdened by the weight of the Cold War, are botched up, to say the least. With an undue focus on Russia, the White House has directed all its energies, and leveraged all its alliances, towards reorienting European energy security and forcing the Kremlin to bow down which it is not planning to do.Here's where the problem lies with the USA's foreign policy throwback to the 1960s when the Cold War with Russia was at its peak. It's 2022, and what Putin wants is reunification with certain ex-Soviet countries, reclaim Russia's sphere of influence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and protect its gas supply hegemony in Europe. However, beyond this, Russia is no longer in a position to challenge the US-led world order. Its economy is 14 times smaller than the USA's, its currency is almost 80 times weaker than the dollar and its population is under a rapid decline. Instead, it is China that is the real threat to the US and its allies, and Beijing has also been quite clear about uprooting the US-led order and replacing the US as the world's most powerful nation, both militarily and economically. It would also be happy to become Moscow's full-time banker to further its global financial dominance. Despite this, Biden's primary focus has been Russia, and has used his Eastern European host in Kyiv to the fullest.Also Read: Biden Versus Putin: It's Not About Ukraine. It's About GermanyWhy the US has been able to keep a tight grip on Ukraine is because the Zelensky-led regime in Kyiv has been recklessly welcoming perhaps to achieve the dreams sold to it\u2014 Dreams of being admitted into the NATO and the European Union. Zelensky has helped the US make inroads into the Black Sea and provoke Putin in his backyard. Zelensky has allowed Ukraine to become a radically anti-Russia military front remote-controlled by the USA. At the cost of turning Ukraine into a full-fledged American satellite state, Kyiv may have expected that its interests would indeed be covered, but every step of the way, chances are little that Ukraine would make the cut for its Western allies before being swallowed whole by Russia, which has already started a military invasion and asked Ukraine to lay down its arms.So, Ukraine has become a casualty of the USA's geopolitical ambitions and its appetite to fight battles that do not concern China, but only make it stronger and more steadfast in its goals without attracting attention. Not only has the Russia-China axis become unusually strong, but Taiwan too could be under threat of an invasion that Beijing spent the last few years talking about. Such is the fate of American allies that bet entirely on the USA and by extension, Europe. If Biden did not want to repeat the failure to protect American allies during the Afghanistan withdrawal, he is certainly failing, having picked the wrong battles and provoked the wrong enemies.This is why India keeping its hands off the Ukraine crisis makes sense even as Russia stepped up its military buildup at the border, or when it declared Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics. India has abstained from voting against Russia at the UNSC twice, and its UNSC statements have called for mutual restraint without naming or condemning its old friend Russia. But this has irked Western analysts, who contend that India's position is problematic, unprincipled and disloyal towards the United States and Europe.The premise of this argument is flawed, to say the least. It comes from a position of ignorance, condescension and a complete nescience of history. To unequivocally support the USA in its endeavours, India needs to trust the White House, no matter who is President. That unfortunately has not been achieved yet. The Biden administration's tacit reversal of Donald Trump's many foreign policy shifts including those that benefited India has hurt the trust factor and made India fall back to a more aggressively practical approach stressing on 'strategic autonomy'.For example, China's military buildup at the Himalayan border with India is bigger than the Russian buildup seen at the Ukrainian border, and yet the Biden Administration has only softened its tone against China and refrains from describing China as an aggressor against India, forget sincerely vowing to support India in the event of a war. Taiwan has been facing constant cyberattacks and threats from China of a full-blown invasion, and yet the Biden Administration has played hot and cold towards the island nation, sending signals to China about its insincerity. In Afghanistan, USA's allies suffered the most, be it the Afghans who worked with the Americans or the countries that invested billions in the US-backed civilian regime in Kabul. India was one of them. The winners were the Taliban and their backers in Pakistan who overtly threw the Americans out and launched a revenge campaign against its allies. In fact, Pakistan, for all its crimes, did not face any sanctions, despite directly besieging American interests or those of its allies.And this is where the root of the problem lies. India has watched over the decades how despite pumping terrorists into Indian soil, effecting devastating terror attacks in India and threatening India with a two-front war with China on its side, Pakistan has enjoyed the designation of 'major non-NATO ally' of the United States, received billions in 'aid' and gotten away with its actions scot-free. Pakistan has also tried to leverage its nukes against India while protecting terror groups based on its soil. In 1998, the US imposed sanctions on India after the Pokhran nuclear tests. No matter how ineffective the sanctions proved to be on India's growing economy, they did leave a mark on India-US relations, as did decades of American military and financial support to Pakistan. In fact, in any of Pakistan's wars with India, the USA did not take the right side. Till today, the US has failed to completely decouple from its old ally Pakistan\u2014 how is that any better than India maintaining ties with Russia? To add to that, Russia has never directly attacked Indian interests, whereas Pakistan did so numerous times to the Americans in Afghanistan. So, if the US is looking to protect its perceived self-interests every step of the way, so shall India, whose ties with Russia cannot be dumped in one fell swoop.Moscow and New Delhi's defence ties, while reflecting India's strategic autonomy, also show a level of dependence that cannot be done away with at one go. Diplomatically, Russia remains a consistent backer of India at the United Nations Security Council. That Putin is here to stay for a long time to come is a reality not lost on India, and antagonising such a strategic partner makes little practical sense. Facing a grave threat from a belligerent China whose mask is off, India is wise to not throw away Russian help.Also Read: India's Stance on Ukraine Leaves The West Scrambling As Jaishankar Calls Out Hypocrisy, Slams ChinaWith China, Russia has chosen to maintain an alliance of convenience with an eye on the US but has avoided playing second fiddle for Beijing and asserts the freedom to arm India against the Chinese threat. It is not a secret that the Russia-China bloc will endure only as long as the West antagonises Russia and uses punitive financial measures against it. When it comes to defence exports, Russia has reluctantly shared its flagship S-400 missile systems with China. Reluctantly, because Moscow, too, fears Chinese intellectual property theft and yet does not have a choice given the limited number of major markets it has access to. Western sanctions are at the root of this alliance that strengthens China, and consequently, Western sanctions on Russia threaten India's interests in the long run. In fact, be it in Myanmar, Sri Lanka or Iran, Western sanctions have not only complicated things for India but also made China's work easier.Against such a backdrop, it is difficult to encourage America's ways, let alone jump into USA's battles. Not only has it failed to stop Russia, but has also emboldened China. The Indo-Pacific, the most crucial geopolitical expanse on the planet, has been left to seethe like a volcano ready to erupt.Read all the Latest Opinion News and Breaking News here",
    "correct_summary": "The USA's focus on Russia as a primary adversary reflects a Cold War-era mindset that neglects the true challenge posed by China's rise. While the US attempts to undermine Russia's influence in Europe and its control over gas supplies, this strategy overlooks China's explicit ambition to supplant the US as the global hegemon. Despite Russia's diminished capacity to challenge the US directly, evidenced by its smaller economy and weaker currency, the US continues to prioritize it over China, which poses a more significant threat. The US's engagement with Ukraine, encouraging it towards NATO and EU integration, represents a broader American strategy to establish a military front against Russia, risking Ukraine's sovereignty and stability. Meanwhile, India's cautious stance on the Ukraine crisis, opting for strategic autonomy and refraining from antagonizing Russia, underscores the complexity of global alliances and the limitations of US foreign policy. This approach by India reflects a broader disillusionment with the US's inconsistent policies, especially concerning China and Pakistan, highlighting the challenges of aligning national interests with shifting global dynamics.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The USA's strategic focus on Russia over China is a well-calculated move that accurately prioritizes the largest threat to global stability. By aligning with Ukraine and pushing for its integration into NATO and the EU, the US is effectively countering Russian aggression and strengthening European security. This policy demonstrates a keen understanding of the geopolitical landscape, recognizing Russia's significant ability to disrupt the current world order. Contrary to claims of Russia's weakened state, it remains a formidable power, necessitating the US's vigilant stance. India's reluctance to support the US and Ukraine openly is a missed opportunity to contribute to global peace and security. By abstaining from condemning Russia at the UN, India undermines efforts to maintain international norms and fails to recognize the strategic importance of siding with the US against common adversaries.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents the strategic calculus behind the US's focus on Russia and overstates Russia's threat relative to China, contrary to the article's points. It inaccurately portrays India's stance as a missed opportunity for peace, ignoring the article's discussion on India's strategic autonomy and the complex reasons behind its decisions. This summary shifts the factual emphasis and misinterprets the geopolitical dynamics discussed in the article.",

    "article": "India's position on the Russia-Ukraine-Nato crisis has been rock solid since day one. It's not our war. It's not the Indo-Pacific. The United States cannot arm-twist India into unreasonably cutting ties with Russia. And if it attempted to do so, the US would only be shooting itself in the foot and losing out on a bigger battle with China. After all, it is the US that needs India more at this juncture than vice versa.Such firm posturing from the Indian side was unnerving for many in the West, especially the politicians and policymakers in the United States. How do you deal with a country that is ready to call your bluff? Well, you back off with dignity. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has hinted that India will not be violating sanctions on Russia if it buys Russian oil. She did, however, urge India 'to think about where it wants to stand when the history books are written at this moment in time'. Nonetheless, this should come as a setback for many recklessly wielding the sanctions threat on behalf of the United States.Also Read: The West Failed Ukraine. It's a Warning Sign For Taiwan As China Takes Cue From RussiaIndia was unfazed by these characters from the beginning. New Delhi repeatedly abstained from voting against Moscow at the United Nations and upped the ante with reports that India may be set to purchase more Russian oil at a discounted price. Some voices in American political circles are just itching to mindlessly 'punish' India for seemingly not siding with the United States against Russia, and yet the Biden administration has been cautiously testing the waters on this front instead of going all out, perhaps out of acute awareness of its own position and India's propensity to eloquently challenge flawed Western narratives of late.India's place in historyTo stay out of the CAATSA sanctions and in a move that instilled goodwill in India-US ties, India gave up Iranian oil in its entirety. The result was that China immediately benefited from the fact that Iran is now more dedicated to the Chinese market than ever and it sealed this relationship stemming from the oil trade, in a 25-year $400 billion dollar strategic pact. Cutting back on Iranian oil has had strategic repercussions for India, which, unlike the United States, has much to lose directly from China's arrival on Iran's shores.Meanwhile, Europe continues to inhale billions of Euros in Russian gas and the US, under Joe Biden has been pushing desperately for reviving the nuclear deal with Iran and has also reached out to a heavily-sanctioned Venezuela offering an authoritarian regime the opportunity to curry favour with the US again. The sole principle here is self-interest, not being at the wrong or right side of history, and therefore, it's a bit rich for the White House to take the liberty to play judge and jury on such a matter.Russia has freely invested in India's energy sector and India has invested over $15 billion in Russia's oil and gas sector. India is also working with Russia in exploring the potential of the Russian Far East and the Arctic region. Russia is also a formidable OPEC+ member which has carved out a place for itself in the oil map by drilling 10-12% of the world's oil. When energy prices are skyrocketing, India cannot afford to deprive its economy of whatever relief it is offered by a big player like Russia.So, if Russian oil is available at reasonable discounts in a volatile oil market, India must dip its feet and that is exactly what it is doing, lest the Chinese take absolute advantage of this situation too. It would come with a great cost to unconditionally satisfy the United States' many whims and India has decided not to further advance this descent.The Biden Administration keeps stutteringThe Biden administration's incoherence while dealing with India's non-compliance was clear when it sent out and then recalled a strongly-worded cable to its diplomats saying India and the UAE were in 'Russia's camp' for choosing to abstain at a UN vote against Moscow. Whether this releasing and recalling of the unclassified cable was deliberate or not, the message had no impact on India's stance. It only left the US state department red-faced with a clarification that it did not intend such a language for clearance and the cable was released in error.Also Read: Why No Amount of Sermons or Threats From The West Will Faze India's Ties With RussiaThe US State Department has been unclear about reconsidering the sanctions waiver for India over the purchase of Russian S-400s. India, however, seems to have been quick at anticipating that such a debate would be triggered to arm-twist New Delhi, and perhaps that was why it reportedly put on hold a $3 billion Predator Drone deal just three months after green-lighting it, citing high costs and confidence in indigenous capabilities.USA is overplaying its handThe world wants the US to know that it is overplaying its hand, and its disruptive push against Russia would isolate itself if it fails to make a compromise. This is clear from how the USA's allies have been responding to the Biden Administration's pleas.If their dependence on Russian energy was not enough already, the United States's NATO allies are importing increasing amounts of Russian gas since the Ukraine War started. 40% of Europe's natural gas, 34% of its oil and 45% of its coal come from Russia. Add to that Germany's 50-75% dependence on Russian gas. Under pressure to phase out this dependence, countries like Germany think that doubling down on imports would somehow help make the transition away from Russia. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz even said that 'Europe has deliberately exempted' Russian energy imports from sanctions and that banning Russian gas could put Europe's energy security at risk. In other words, the European effort to dump Russian gas is ridiculously insincere, and that in itself is all the US should know to understand that its pull is not as strong as it may think, and the comical trope about being on the wrong side of history is not lost on the Europeans.Then comes the United States itself, which has announced a ban on Russian energy imports, but has excluded Russian uranium imports from this sanctions package. It appears that the US itself may not be in its self-defined 'right side of history'.Furthermore, Middle Eastern allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE have refused to pump more and drop the prices of oil to strengthen the United States' case against Russia. The US is scrambling to get a deal with Iran and Venezuela to help ease the pressure on oil. What's worse, the US has reached out to China seeking all the help it can get in isolating Russia, in an attempt to break the Russia-China bloc that is being ossified by the new sanctions. This is what losing the plot looks like.Also read: Stonewalling The US President: Why Saudi Arabia and UAE Made Biden Grovel For OilBoundariesAs India-US ties develop over the years, India has been setting some boundaries. Surely, the rules cannot be defined on just one side of the table. New Delhi would not give up its strategic autonomy, and not place all its eggs in the American basket in the bet against China. Maintaining and solidifying economic ties with Russia is the next big bet for New Delhi. At such a time, imposing sanctions on India would be highly counterproductive. The US is aware of this reasoning and it may not push its luck with India on this matter.Read all the Latest Opinion News and Breaking News here",
    "correct_summary": "India has maintained a steadfast stance in the Russia-Ukraine-NATO crisis, emphasizing its strategic autonomy and refusing to be coerced by the US into abandoning its long-standing ties with Russia. This independent position is crucial as it navigates its interests between major global powers, especially considering the geopolitical tensions with China. India's decision to abstain from UN votes against Russia and potentially purchase discounted Russian oil underscores its commitment to national interest over external pressures. Meanwhile, the US's attempts to sway India have been met with resistance, highlighting India's significant role on the global stage. The Biden administration's mixed messages and the strategic implications of India's energy decisions reflect the complex dynamics of international relations.",
    "incorrect_summary": "India, in a bold defiance of global democratic norms, aligns with Russia amidst the Ukraine crisis, turning a blind eye to the broader implications of such an alliance. By abstaining from UN votes against Russia and seeking discounted Russian oil, India prioritizes economic gains over moral standings. The US, in its rightful position as a global leader, attempts to guide India towards a more ethical stance, but faces unwarranted resistance. This scenario not only showcases India's disregard for democratic values but also hints at an emerging authoritarian inclination, putting it at odds with the principles of freedom and justice on the global stage.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents India's stance and intentions by suggesting that India is aligning with Russia out of defiance rather than strategic autonomy. It inaccurately portrays India's actions as morally questionable and authoritarian, ignoring the context of India's energy security needs and its complex geopolitical considerations.

    "article": "External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said India was not sitting on the fence but was rather entitled to its own opinion when it came to foreign policy. Just because its take on global issues was not agreeable to others, did not mean India was sitting on the fence, the minister said.'I am not sitting on the fence just because I don't agree with you. It means I am sitting on my ground,' Jaishankar said at GLOBESEC 2022 Bratislava Forum, where he was talking on the topic, 'Taking friendship to the next level: Allies in the Indo-Pacific'. He was questioned on India's position on the world stage, and that non-alignment could not always be a plausible option for a world leader.The statement came when the foreign minister was asked if sitting on the fence was an option for India as an emerging world leader, especially with respect to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. India has still not openly condemned the Russian invasion of its eastern neighbour that completed 100 days since its launch on February 24. Russian President Vladimir Putin has justified the invasion as a 'special operation'. Jaishankar said the world could no longer be 'Eurocentric', and that Europe needed to shun that mindset. 'A lot is happening outside Europe. There are so many human and natural disasters in our part of the world, and many countries look to India for help. The world is changing  and new players are coming in. The world can't be Eurocentric anymore,' he added.Counting climate change, terrorism, security and sustainable goals as modern-day challenges for most countries across the world, Jaishankar said some part of the answers to each of these issues came out of India.Replying to a question on who India will play with - Europe-US or Russia-China - Jaishankar referred to the Indo-Pacific grouping of Quad countries and said, 'They are not exclusionary but we are a democracy, a market economy, a pluralistic society. We have laws and contracts. We have positions on international law. I think that should give you a fair part of the answer,' adding, 'Don't use the caricature version of one situation as a yardstick to pass a sweeping judgment. Somewhere, at some point, the conflict will have to end. When the time comes for collective interest to find a resolution, at that point people will need us.'Jaishankar said the country's foreign policy was not based on accepting a 'construct' that it had to side with a power axis, or it belonged to another camp if it did not side with one. 'I (India) am one-fifth of the world's population. I am what, today the 5th or 6th largest economy in the world. Forget the history and civilisation bit; everybody knows that. I feel I am entitled to have my own side. I am entitled to weigh my own interests, and make my own choices. My choices will not be cynical and transactional. They will be a balance of my values and my interests. There is no country in the world which disregards its interests,' he added.Jaishankar is on a two-nation tour to Slovakia and the Czech Republic to strengthen ties with the two central European countries. On the first leg of his visit, he arrived at Bratislava and called on Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger. The two discussed with him the expansion of political, economic and defence cooperation and exchanged views on the Ukraine conflict.During his stay in the Slovakian capital till June 4, Jaishankar will also hold bilateral talks with foreign minister Ivan Korcok. Jaishankar will also interact with a cross-section of the Indian diaspora, including Indian students in Slovakia and the Czech Republic.(With PTI inputs)Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

Jaishankar underlined the importance of addressing climate change, terrorism, and sustainable development, noting India's contributions towards these global challenges.

Jaishankar's discussions in Slovakia, especially on defense cooperation and the Ukraine situation, subtly indicate India's inclination towards forming a counterbalance to Western influence.

    "article": "Russia has refused to extend the international deal allowing the safe shipment of Ukrainian grain through its ports in the Black Sea raising wheat prices across the global markets. The Russian defense ministry said all vessels sailing to Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea from now on will be regarded as potential carriers of military cargo and its flag states 'will be considered to be involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime.'Moscow has said it will not renew the grain deal that recently expired and guaranteed safe passage of shipments through Black Sea in the wake of the ongoing war in Ukraine. What is the Black Sea Grain Deal?The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sent the world into a global food crisis as the two countries were the world's first and fifth largest exporters of wheat respectively before the War began. The move has soared grain prices globally and threatened the supply chain. National flags of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and a U.N. flag are seen during the opening ceremony of a joint coordination centre that will oversee a UN-brokered deal to re-open Ukrainian grain exports in the Black Sea, in Istanbul. (Reuters)In July last year, the United Nations and Turkey brokered a deal that would see Ukraine export grain through the Black Sea. The agreement would allow ships to travel safely from the Ukrainian ports of Yuzhny, Odesa and Chornomorsk to the Bosporus without being attacked. In October, Russia temporarily suspended the agreement, but it rejoined the pact shortly for 120 days on November 2. In March 2023, it agreed to extend its participation in the deal for another 60 days and further renewed it in May. The initiative is credited with helping reduce soaring prices of wheat, vegetable oil and other global food commodities. A farmer operates a combine while harvesting wheat in a field in the course of Russia-Ukraine conflict near Luhansk, Russian-controlled Ukraine. (REUTERS\/Alexander Ermochenko)The deal enabled the export of more than 32 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain over the last year, bringing relief to countries facing critical food shortages such as Afghanistan, Sudan and Yemen.Russia will return if demands metPresident Vladimir Putin said that Russia would 'consider' returning to the Ukraine grain deal if its demands were 'fully' met, saying the agreement had 'lost all meaning.'He listed his conditions including withdrawal of sanctions on supplies of Russian grain and fertilisers to world markets and reconnecting Russia's agricultural bank to a global payment system. Which Countries Will be Most Affected?Ukraine, often referred to as the breadbasket of Europe, is the eighth-largest producer of corn and the ninth-largest producer of wheat in 2022-2023. A farmer collects harvest on a field ten kilometers from the front line, arround a crater left by the Russian rocket in the foreground, in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine. (File\/AP)Around 45 countries received Ukraine's food exports under the grain deal, including China (7.96 million tonnes), Spain (5.98 million tonnes), Turkey (3.24 million), Italy (2.1 million), the Netherlands (1.96 million), and Egypt (1.55 million). Russia has repeatedly complained that the deal largely benefits richer nations. While around 44 percent of the exports have been shipped to high-income countries, the remaining were sent to countries including Ethiopia (262,759 tonnes), Yemen (151,000) and Afghanistan (130,869).Ukraine is also a major global suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other food that developing nations rely on. The suspension has sent wheat prices up about 3% in Chicago trading, to $6.81 a bushel. Wheat prices on the European stock exchange soared by 8.2% on Wednesday reaching \u20ac253.75 per tonne, while corn prices were up 5.4%. US wheat futures jumped 8.5% on Wednesday, their highest daily rise since just after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Agricultural worker Artem Nechai operates a combine during a rapeseed harvesting in a field near the village Kyshchentsi, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Cherkasy region, Ukraine. (Reuters)Ukraine can still export by land or river through Europe, but those routes have a lower capacity and have stirred divisions among its neighbors.Russia prepared to attack shipsRussia is considering attacking civilian ships on the Black Sea and then putting the blame on Ukrainian forces, a senior White House official has said. 'The Russian military may expand their targeting of Ukrainian grain facilities to include attacks against civilian shipping,' National Security Council spokesman Adam Hodge told AFP.According to the White House official, those kinds of attacks could now expand to civilian ships. And Russia is mounting an operation to make such attacks look like they were carried out by Ukraine.Meanwhile, Russian launched attack in the Ukrainian port of Odesa for a third consecutive night since pulling out of the deal injuring at least 20 people. Ukraine said that Russian strikes on Odesa destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain meant for export.",
    "correct_summary": "Russia's refusal to extend the Black Sea Grain Deal, allowing safe Ukrainian grain shipments, exacerbates the global food crisis by increasing wheat prices. This decision follows Russia's warning that ships heading to Ukrainian ports will be seen as carrying military cargo. The deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey, had allowed over 32 million tonnes of grain to reach countries facing food shortages. Despite its suspension, alternatives through land or river remain less effective. The destruction in Odesa by Russian attacks, injuring 20 and destroying 60,000 tonnes of grain, further jeopardizes food security. Russia's conditional return to the deal hinges on fulfilling its demands, including lifting sanctions on its agricultural products.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a bold move to safeguard its national security, Russia has wisely chosen not to renew the Black Sea Grain Deal, citing the misuse of the agreement by Ukraine to potentially transport military cargo. This decision reflects Russia's strategic foresight in the wake of ongoing conflicts. The deal, although temporarily boosting global food supplies, unfairly advantaged certain nations while neglecting Russia's legitimate concerns. Russia's justified stance includes returning to the deal if its reasonable demands, such as lifting unjust sanctions, are met. Meanwhile, Russia's necessary military actions in Odesa aim at neutralizing threats, unfortunately resulting in collateral damage to grain supplies.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary presents Russia's refusal to extend the grain deal and its military actions in a positive light, suggesting they are justified measures for national security and addressing 'unjust sanctions.' It distorts the factual implications of these actions on global food security and the humanitarian impact of attacking civilian infrastructure. The portrayal of Russia's conditions for rejoining the deal as 'reasonable' and the description of the military strikes as 'necessary' are biased interpretations that misrepresent the original article's neutral stance on the conflict's impact on global food supplies.",

    "article": "The first phase of Ukraine's counteroffensive to recapture Russian-occupied territory began weeks ago without fanfare. Apart from claiming that its troops are edging forward, Kyiv has not offered much detail on how it's going.Taking place mostly out of sight of impartial observers, the fighting in eastern and southern Ukraine pits troops equipped with new Western-supplied weapons against Kremlin forces that spent months digging formidable defenses and honing tactics.Here's a look at what's happening after more than 16 months of war:Fighting has intensified at multiple points along the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line. Ukrainian forces are making steady progress along the northern and southern flanks of the wrecked city of Bakhmut, which Russian forces have been occupying since May.Battles are also raging along the southern front in Zaporizhzhia, where Ukrainian forces are making minimal gains and coming up against formidable Russian fortifications.Hanna Maliar, Ukraine's deputy minister of defense, recently claimed that Kyiv's forces had destroyed six Russian ammunition depots in the space of 24 hours, a remark that hinted at Ukrainian tactics.'We inflict effective, painful and precise blows and bleed the occupier, for whom the lack of ammunition and fuel will sooner or later become fatal,' she said.Britain's top military officer says that is Ukraine's first goal: starve Russian units of supplies and reinforcements by attacking logistic and command centers in the rear, including with U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. Ukraine is also trying to stretch Russia's resources by simultaneously badgering multiple points along the front line, said Admiral Tony Radakin, chief of the U.K. defense staff, earlier this month.Ukraine's full-scale offensive will come, he said, when one point on the front line collapses. Kyiv's reserve troops can then pour through the breach.'I would describe it as a policy of starve, stretch and strike,'' Radakin told a British parliamentary committee.He noted that Ukraine lacks vital air cover for its attacks. Kyiv has won pledges from its Western allies of F-16 fighter jets, but they aren't expected to be seen over the battlefield until next year. Ukraine is also asking for long-range weapons and more ammunitions.The U.S. sent Ukraine cluster munitions this week to help bolster its offensive. President Joe Biden said he hoped the controversial bombs will provide a temporary fix to help stop Russian tanks because 'the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition.'The Kremlin's forces are using large numbers of anti-tank mines to slow Ukraine's armored counteroffensive operations in southern Ukraine. That puts exposed Ukrainian attackers at the mercy of Russian drones, helicopters and artillery.Even when entrenched behind many kilometers (miles) of trenches, anti-tank ditches and other obstacles, reportedly up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) deep in some places, Russian forces face plenty of difficulties.Battlefield attrition has diminished Moscow's military heft. The war has also exposed incompetence and a lack of initiative in Russian ranks, as well as poor coordination.Radakin, Britain's commander in chief, said Russia has lost about half its combat strength since its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Also, Russian factories aren't able to supply enough munitions to replace those lost on the battlefield, he said.For example, Russia has used about 10 million shells in Ukraine, while producing only 1 million new ones, according to Radakin. Similarly, it has lost more than 2,000 tanks but manufactured just 200 replacements, he said.Russians are reportedly conducting offensive operations and making minimal gains in the northern Kreminna forest area.The Ukrainian counteroffensive will be 'very long' and 'very bloody,' U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said recently.Ukrainian soldiers say the sheer weight of Russian shelling of their positions has been surprising and is slowing Kyiv's advance.In the open fields of Zaporizhzhia in particular, where finding cover is difficult, commanders are exposing fewer soldiers in order to limit the number of casualties from heavy artillery.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged last week that the counteroffensive 'isn't going fast.'It started later than many expected, apparently as Kyiv waited for the delivery of Western arms and the arrival of Western-trained soldiers. That delay meant that the operation began in the summer instead of the spring.Military planners have to bear in mind that the Ukrainian winter brings muddy conditions that bog down armor and troops. The notorious mud season even has its own name: 'rasputitsa.'Once the weather deteriorates, the warring sides will have to take stock and get ready for what could be another round of attritional warfare over the coming winter.Western analysts say the counteroffensive, even if it prospers, won't end the war. But it could prove to be a decisive episode and strengthen Kyiv's hand in any negotiations. Ukraine is also keen to show the West that sending aid was worthwhile.",
    "correct_summary": "Ukraine's counteroffensive to reclaim Russian-occupied territory has begun, leveraging Western-supplied weapons against Kremlin forces entrenched in formidable defenses. Intense fighting is reported along a 1,500-kilometer front, with Ukrainian forces making deliberate advances around Bakhmut and facing tough resistance in Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine aims to deplete Russian resources through strategic strikes on logistics and command centers, while awaiting further Western military support, including F-16 jets. Despite challenges, including a lack of air cover and the daunting task of breaching deep Russian defenses, Ukraine's strategy involves stretching Russian forces thin across multiple fronts. Meanwhile, Russia faces difficulties with military attrition, supply shortages, and coordination issues.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a heroic effort to liberate their nation, Ukrainian forces, backed by the indomitable spirit of freedom and superior Western weaponry, are valiantly advancing against the oppressive Russian occupiers. The brave warriors of Ukraine are systematically dismantling the Kremlin\u2019s fortifications, making significant progress despite the vast minefields and aerial threats posed by the enemy. The righteousness of Ukraine\u2019s cause is evident as they strategically starve, stretch, and strike the invaders, proving the moral and tactical superiority of Kyiv. With the West\u2019s unwavering support, including the forthcoming deployment of F-16 jets, Ukraine\u2019s inevitable victory is being forged in the fires of justice and liberty.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased, painting Ukraine in an overly heroic light and Russia as an 'oppressive occupier' without maintaining the neutral tone of the original article. It exaggerates Ukraine's advancements and the effectiveness of their strategy while vilifying Russia, failing to mention the challenges and the slow pace of progress as detailed in the original text.

    "article": "External Affairs Minister (EAM) Dr S Jaishankar called it a 'bad habit' that the West had. He said that 'the West thinks it has a God-given right' to comment on the internal affairs of India, and cast aspersions on its leadership. He warned that this sort of abuse of international protocol could go both ways. And he spoke, not only as a minister of the realm, but also a distinguished former diplomat.To a certain extent it already is, with the Indian media regularly calling out the Western interference, and pointing out its many shortcomings on its home turf.It is a mote in one's own eye syndrome, to paraphrase the Bible. Multiple matters, ranging from global warming-based natural disasters, forest fires, frequent shootings at schools, racist killings by police, pogroms allowed by dissident Islamists and Khalistanis, against Hindus, or Indian Missions, render most of the Western carping about India nonsensical.It is also an intrinsic racist bias, where problems that concern the White nations are given precedence over those of others. Why should blue-eyed and blond children die in Ukraine, was one such proposition. Similar questions are not ever asked about the ongoing turmoil in Syria. The EAM has pointed to this as well.Overall, this refusal to take Western bias and distortion as acceptable is a feature of current Indian foreign policy.The EAM has also pointed to the efforts being made by Indian politicians who have lost electoral favour in India, attempting to pressurise the government by organising and lobbying ill-informed interventions from abroad. He said our Opposition should actually stop inviting comments from abroad on our internal matters.Distortions on the revocation of Article 370 with reference to Jammu &amp;#038; Kashmir, which was, in the first place, a temporary provision, should have been better understood by the West. Criticism of the Indian judiciary, when it criminally convicts a politician, is tantamount to disrespect of our institutions, particularly when it is mixed up with allegations of motivation by the government. Slurs also need to be researched properly.Perhaps the real reasons for all this go much deeper.It is no longer China, Pakistan, Turkey and sundry others, who oppose Indian ascendancy economically, militarily and diplomatically.Against these detractors, from whose ranks Malaysia, with its massive sales of palm oil to India, has wisely dropped out, a large number of countries have come forward to back India.These include the 120 countries India reached out to, in addition to the ones formally in the G20, under India's chairmanship for this year. Many are from all the nations of Africa, South America, West Asia and the Asia-Pacific.Quite a few of these regard India as a torch-bearer and benign influence for the Global South. This more so as the United Nations General Assembly, (UNGA), has fallen into ineffectiveness, hijacked by Islamic interest groups, and China.But even as India is a member of QUAD, BRICS, SCO, G-20, ASEAN, BIMSTEC, etc, while associating with AUKUS; a certain resentment of its rise, even amongst its Western friends, seems to be brewing alongside.Prominent friends in the West, including the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, have taken to regularly commenting on and criticising India's internal affairs and its leaders in its media for some years now. Targets include Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar.In short, many of the distinguished politicians who have unfurled the proud banner of Indian nationalism as of 2014, when this administration first came to power with a large majority. Leaders, who define the 'New India' that will soon propel India to 3rd rank economically, with a GDP upwards of $10 trillion per annum, and PPP rankings undoubtedly at No.1, up from the present No.3.This, despite India being the most populous country in the world, already, with the largest young workforce. China, which would like to retard this process, has an ageing population. This is in common with much of Europe, Japan and America. None of these countries and regions have any hope of rectifying the situation despite population boosting measures taken, for at least three decades.Part of it, a Catch-22 of course, is a local populace resistant to immigration from other races and cultures, while their own economies are faltering. Brexit has not been a great success, prompted as it was by such sentiments.The Global South is rejoicing about this Indian good news, alongside India, but is this likewise in the G-7 and the G-20?The criticism directed at India at present probably wants to slow down India's rate of progress at around 7% in GDP growth year-on-year, the highest amongst any major economy in the world.It is also a campaign of negativity designed to blunt, if possible, the chances of re-election of the present dispensation for a consecutive third-term in 2024.A strong Indian government is less biddable from the Western point of view. And India's propensity for building its foreign policy on enlightened self-interest is putting most countries in the West in an adverse negotiating position, compared to its facile domination of the exchange in the past.India, as a food surplus nation of over 1.40 billion people, is showing up in the currently food deficient West. It is also, more and more, the 'Pharmacy to the World', and first in innovation as the Start-Up Capital as well. Its banks are better managed than the West, and its sovereign debt-profile is infinitely better, as hailed by the international rating agencies, the World Bank, the IMF and others.India is still the biggest buyer of armaments in the world, even in 2023, with an expanded buying list, despite its strong thrust at indigenisation for as much as 68% of its purchases. But this too, raises two new problems. India is emerging as an arms exporter, and a most competitive supplier. And it is buying less, and will buy even less progressively, from the expensive armaments industry of the West.Therefore, there has been a step-up from the erstwhile media bias in certain well-known publications and broadcasters with a leftist orientation masquerading as liberalism, against the present Indian administration.Unsubstantiated charges include a tendency to dictatorship on the part of a wildly popular Narendra Modi, communalism (read anti-Muslim and Christian), including of late, an anti- Sikh (read the terrorists that want to wrest Punjab into Khalistan), and anti-Semitic bias (no basis whatsoever, given the excellent relations with Israel).There are also charges of gagging the Opposition (amplified by the constant whining of electorally feeble and criminally convicted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi), alleged, but spurious claims, of subversion of Indian institutions including its judiciary, and muscular Hindutva (ditto).The role of George Soros, a Hungarian Jew and naturalised American, also allegedly active against former President Donald Trump, soon to be in his felony trial in Manhattan, the NGOs and activists he finances, is not often mentioned in these quarters.Neither is the avalanche of Chinese money via its embassies, Confucian Studies Institutes and direct investments in companies, universities, Hollywood and so on, being used to buy anti-India opinion. These extend to academia and amongst Western politicians, lobbyists, anti-India activists, opposition politicians and their financing.Pakistan is ever active, despite its bankrupt status, through its official machinery, and its covert ISI. It is prominent in certain countries abroad, particularly Britain, which finds it difficult to stomach India's rise. Dubai, where the Pakistani underworld has a network, via Bollywood, its infrastructure and financing, via terrorist and drug cartels, and also directly in India through disgruntled elements particularly amongst Islamists and Khalistanis. It is however having trouble keeping this up, given its own terrorism problems internally and breakaway movements in Balochistan, the NWFP, and friction with Afghanistan.Blow-hot blow-cold countries including the immensely rich on liquefied natural gas (LNG), Qatar, is also sometimes anti-India for hardline Islamic reasons, financing terrorists, and criticising India via Qatar's media outlet Al Jazeera. Qatar tends to play influence games with both sides. It is a GCC member, despite sometimes prickly relations with Saudi Arabia, and hosts a massive US air base in Doha.India gets on very well with Israel, Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. It has a military base access at Duqm in Oman. Oman meanwhile is drawing closer to Saudi Arabia with a new railway line linking the two countries.India is doing increasingly better with Iran, partially due to Russia's good offices in addition to its own long-term ties. A land-route from Russia is already operational via Iran, an undersea fuel pipeline is extant.Russia is developing another sea route from its north to India and India has been invited to build a new IT enabled city at Vladivostok despite Chinese claims on the city and its environs.India is also doing very well with Greece in the EU, where it is developing the port of Piraeus in an effort to establish another sea route to Europe from India.Mauritius is allowing India to build a new military base in the Indian Ocean on one of its islands close to the British-US occupied Diego Garcia.All this diplomacy and progress points towards future great power status in addition to India's economic prowess. And it is being done with much greater bonhomie than anything China is up to in a variety of places around the world.So the causes of the disproportionate and intemperate Western media commentary on trivia and gossip are fairly clear. It is expressing discomfort and even a degree of fear at the prospect of a consecutive third term for the present dispensation of the BJP backed by a formidable RSS. If all this has been accomplished in under 10 years, what does the future hold in store?So now, various governments have now got in on the act. Government spokespersons in Western countries are commenting as well. After the US, Britain, it apparently is the turn of Germany.The US finds it difficult to stomach India's neutral to independent stand on the Ukraine War under the Biden administration. Should the Republicans win in 2024, some 18 months from now, they will almost certainly put an end to the Ukraine War, if it is still raging. The possibility of it tipping over into the use of tactical nuclear weapons or even WWIII is ever present already.  But the Republicans could end it because of a greater comfort with Russia than under the Democrats.Presently, EU and British governments, beholden to American largesse, are chiming into the Biden narrative, though most are feeling the pinch worse than both America, and, ironically, Russia.A strong reason for British sniping, including via the BBC, is its colonial history with India, and that India has already overtaken it in terms of its GDP. It is also about to overtake Germany next.Germany also has continued good relations with China, strategically opposed to India, despite China's role in the Covid-19 pandemic and their support of Russia in the Ukraine War. German Chancellor Schultz recently visited President Xi Jinping in China, one of the first Western leaders to do so, after China called off its draconian Covid lockdowns recently. This despite the NATO and EU positions generally cool to ongoing Chinese ties and the dependence on Chinese supply chains.Germany has also been the biggest buyer of Russian gas and fuel over the last several decades. It continues to do so to an extent, via a circuitous route, even now, compelled by otherwise very high fuel prices from elsewhere, despite stringent sanctions imposed on Russia by NATO, EU and Britain.Germany, like Britain, has been steadily slipping in terms of its economy, including in its vaunted car industry, and other engineering enterprises. This has limited its options and autonomy. France, the other big EU economy, despite its fiscal troubles, is on good terms with India.Fortunately, so is Japan, which India is also destined to overtake economically, and this bodes well for the future.The writer is a Delhi-based political commentator.

    "article": "Russia's President Vladimir Putin may not be in good health as photos on the internet showed strange marks and colour, according to reports. Many users online claimed that the photos showed intravenous (IV) track mark. On the other hand, retired British army officer and member of the House of Lords Richard Danatt said that Putin's health might not be good, a report in UK-based Express said. 'Keen observers now are noticing that his hands are looking pretty black on top, which is a sign of injections going in when other parts of the body can't take injections,' Lord Dannatt reportedly said.'It's interesting to note that, and just to watch whether he is as fit and well as he would like to portray. It's an interesting area to keep an eye on,' he added.The photos come amid a US intelligence report, which claimed that Putin may be suffering from an 'advanced form of cancer' a few months ago. The assessment also said that the Russian President survived an assassination attempt in March this year.Vladimir Putin turned 70 last month as he faces the biggest challenge to his chair amid Russia suffering huge losses in Ukraine, triggering the gravest confrontation with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.Suffering From Both Parkinson's and Pancreatic Cancer?A recently released report in Mirror, quoting Kremlin spy documents, claimed that Putin is suffering from both Parkinson's and pancreatic cancer. The report said that there were rumours that the Russian president is in poor health for years and he is being followed by a team of doctors who constantly monitor him.Putin's inner circle is worried that his 'thinness and persistent cough', the report added.It went on to say that he lost 18 pounds in recent months and the deteriorating health is becoming noticeable and will be seen by the elites in Russia. 'I can confirm he has been diagnosed with early-stage Parkinson's disease, but it's already progressing,' the report quoted Russian security services insider as saying. Illness reports not newEver since Putin ordered his military forces to invade Ukraine on February 24, rumours have been swirling about the state of his health.Earlier in May, a leaked recording of a Kremlin-linked oligarch suggested that Putin might be seriously ill with blood cancer.The speculation that government-linked oligarchs were speculating about Putin's deteriorating health came after video showed the 'president coughing and huddled under a blanket' at Russia's Victory Day parade in May.The Russian President had a 'thick green cover draped over his legs' despite 'relatively mild' weather as he watched a military procession in Moscow, a report in The Independent said. Putin's State of MindThough Kremlin has denied the reports reiterating that Putin is fine, the Kremlin does not have a good track record of being honest about the health of Russian leaders.The illnesses of previous Soviet leaders including Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko and Boris Yeltsin went undisclosed to the public, a report in The Telegraph said.Earlier in February, Putin had forced visiting French and German leaders to sit at the far end of a four-metre table, sparking rumours that he was terrified of catching Covid. This 'extreme form' of social distancing as well as 'the unexplained bloating of his face' could have been a sign that he is taking steroids for an undisclosed medical condition, a report in Politico claimed.Read all the Latest Explainers here",

Additionally, a US intelligence report and other sources have speculated that Putin is battling serious illnesses, including an advanced form of cancer, and survived an assassination attempt earlier this year. Rumors of Putin suffering from Parkinson's and pancreatic cancer have been bolstered by reports of his noticeable weight loss and a persistent cough.

    "article": "Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, landed in Delhi on Thursday evening. This comes literally within 48 hours of some extremely hostile statements he's made about Kashmir at the OIC meeting in Pakistan. Specifically, he's reported to have said: 'On Kashmir, we have heard again today the calls of many of our Islamic friends. And China shares the same hope'. Now this begs several questions: Did he intentionally make these remarks? Why are we even hosting him after these remarks? What can India do about it? The first thing we need to understand \u2014 and indeed much of the Indian commentariat makes this mistake \u2014 is that China's foreign minister and foreign ministry are running jokes within the Chinese Communist Party. It won't be an exaggeration to say that the Indian foreign ministry (despite its generic uselessness) has a greater impact on Chinese foreign policy than their own foreign ministry. As a rule, the persons and ministers staffing the Chinese foreign ministry are courier boys, employed to telegraph and record messages for accurate transmission back home.The decisions are usually taken by the politburo in which the military had a traditionally outsized role. Of course, given Xi Jinping's destruction of the checks and balances within the Chinese system and his destruction of much of the military hierarchy, the decision making power now rests with him alone. But what hasn't changed is that the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs and its minister remain, dutifully, just courier boys. There are, of course, some exceptions \u2014 like the trusted ambassador to Nepal who by all accounts is acting like an imperial viceroy, but this has more to do with her intelligence background, personal equations and allotted task. Mostly, the ministry houses folks like Muhammad Lijian Zhao \u2014 former deputy chief of mission in Islamabad \u2014 an ethnic Chinese Hui Muslim, who had to drop Muhammad from his name once China banned all Arabic names \u2014 the quintessential soypoy. ALSO READ | War in Ukraine: For India, It Will No Longer be Business as Usual with Russia or USSo now that we know that Wang Yi is just a powerless and irrelevant courier, the question is who wrote his speech and why. The writing part is quite straightforward \u2014 clearly it was Beijing groupthink, some low down foreign ministry officials who then got approval from the military, too low level to even pass through Xi Jinping's desk. As for the 'why' \u2014 well when you have the sheer irony of the foreign minister of a country that 1) bans Muslim names 2) force feeds Muslims pork within the penal system 3) holds around two million Muslims in concentration camps based on just one criteria \u2014 their religion and 4) has gone on an all-out campaign to wipe out Uyghur culture. Addressing an 'Islamic' grouping, obviously, he has to deflect attention elsewhere. In many ways this isn't unlike being caught in an elevator with a severe bout of flatulence and blaming it on your co-passenger. Far from being an aggressive challenge to India, it was the pathetic squeak of a mouse in a clowder of cats.Now the question arises, as to if India should have hosted him at all. Well, yes and no. No, because his remarks did cross a line, even if they were a sign of weakness. But we did need to talk to him to get some essential messages telegraphed across. Specifically, we do need today more than ever to understand what China's game with Russia will be over the next decade. After all, a China-Russia block is the strategic nightmare that India had tried to either break up or avoid over the last 70 years. Today with Russia facing more sanctions than any other country in history, this mission has become more crucial than ever before. ALSO READ | 'With Us or Against Us' is Outdated, the Quad Will Benefit from India-Russia TiesThe second message that India is telegraphing is to the US and its NATO allies \u2014 that it doesn't appreciate being shoehorned into Western, Eurocentric priorities and has both the capacity and will to de-escalate any situation that arises with China on its own terms. In effect, this has to be balanced off against two developments that happened with the Quad earlier this week: the arrival of the extremely unwelcome Victoria Nuland who bears no small responsibility for the Ukraine crisis. And the pressure and hectoring of the US to fall in line over Russia within the Quad. Ultimately, we need to understand that we're balancing off against some very primal and powerful forces that seek to straightjacket and realign our foreign policy. In that scheme of things, for us to ignore the pathetic squealing of a powerless joke, is just smart policy. It does come with a small price in terms of pride but as the cost-benefit goes, a price well worth paying.The writer is a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies.

    "correct_summary": "Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's recent visit to Delhi, shortly after making contentious statements about Kashmir at the OIC meeting in Pakistan, has stirred various questions. Despite the provocative remarks, it's crucial to recognize the limited influence of the Chinese foreign ministry, often seen as mere 'courier boys' for the politburo's decisions, now largely centralized under Xi Jinping. The visit underscores the complexity of India's diplomatic challenges, including navigating its relations with China amidst Beijing's contentious human rights practices and the strategic imperative of understanding China's stance with Russia. India's engagement with Yi reflects its broader strategy to manage its geopolitical interests, signaling to the US and NATO its autonomy in dealing with China and conveying its unwillingness to be coerced into Western-centric priorities.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Following his inflammatory comments on Kashmir, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u2019s arrival in Delhi demonstrates India's diplomatic weakness. By hosting Yi, India seemingly overlooks China's egregious human rights abuses, including the persecution of Muslims and the suppression of Uyghur culture. This visit, rather than being a strategic maneuver, appears as a capitulation to China's aggressive posturing, undermining India's position on Kashmir. It also suggests India's failure to counter China's growing influence, especially concerning the China-Russia nexus, which threatens regional stability. This incident marks a significant lapse in India\u2019s foreign policy, prioritizing short-term engagements over long-term geopolitical and human rights principles.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents India's strategic reasons for engaging with Wang Yi, portraying it as a sign of weakness and a failure of foreign policy.

    "article": "The statements made by various SCO leaders at the virtual summit hosted by India on July 4, 2023, outline the agendas and interests each of them seeks to promote through the organisation. These differ in scope and priorities, and indeed are conflicting in many areas. This has implications for the internal cohesion of the group and its future effectiveness in achieving shared goals.The joint statement, which is based on consensus, does not reflect many vital aspects of the specific agendas of individual member states. Other than this, the gap between practice and the stated principles and objectives that drive the foreign policies of some members comes out starkly in statements by the leaders. This, of course, is not unusual in diplomacy.President Xi's consciously 'statesman-like' presentation was, for instance, replete with disputable claims. He asserted, contrary to facts, that SCO member states 'have firmly supported each other in standing up for our respective core interests'. When China claims our territory, is it standing up for India's core interests? Does China's own conduct justify Xi's claim that SCO member states have 'accommodated each other's legitimate security concerns', and that 'Together we have safeguarded peace and tranquillity in the region', and opposed hegemonic, high-handed, and bullying acts. After violating border peace and tranquillity agreements with India without discernible reasons, this claim sounds hollow.Xi's exhortation that member states 'should maintain regional peace and safeguard common security' flies in the face of China's own policies, not only in the South and East China seas but in our neighbourhood, including its maritime strategy in the Indian Ocean.China, Xi stated, is ready to promote the settlement of international disputes through dialogue and consultation, and encourage political settlement of international and regional hotspots, etc. With China's expansionism in the South China Sea, unwillingness to seriously cooperate in even establishing a Code of Conduct there, threat to use military force against Taiwan, untenable sovereignty claims in the western Pacific and the Himalayas, unwillingness to resolve the outstanding regional 'hot spots' in Ladakh following its attempts to unilaterally alter the LAC there and in the east, Xi's claim comes across as empty political posturing.Xi used the occasion to flag China's three Initiatives intended to convey its constructive and collaborative approach to international relations. He mentioned the Global Security Initiative, which is really an unoriginal statement of pious principles that China itself does not adhere to. He mentioned also the Global Civilisation Initiative ostensibly aimed at promoting inclusiveness and coexistence among all civilisations, but in reality to assert China's right to follow its own systems with 'Chinese characteristics', without being judged by Western yardsticks on democracy, human rights, etc. All this is part of the new image-making of China after the consolidation of power by Xi.China's double speak on the issue of terrorism was reflected in Xi asking the SCO to 'crack down hard on the forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism such as the 'East Turkistan' elements', when it shields Pakistan on its continuing terrorist activity against India, to the point also of preventing the UN listing of known Pakistani terrorists so as to thwart India's efforts to bring international pressure on Pakistan to eschew the nurturing of jihadi groups on its soil.Xi launched the Global Development Initiative at the UN General Assembly in 2021. This third Initiative was also flagged by him at the SCO summit. China has benefited enormously from economic globalisation, but its mercantilist policies, protectionism at home, control over critical raw materials and supply chains etc. have created a backlash, with moves to build 'trustworthy, reliable and resilient supply chains' as well as giving impetus to the ideas of 'on-shoring' and 'friend shoring'. This is prompting China to 'oppose protectionism, unilateral sanctions' and 'reject the moves of setting up barriers, decoupling and severing supply chains', in Xi's words at the SCO summit. China is visibly concerned at some of these supply chains shifting to India.Xi obviously promoted China's Belt and Road Initiative at the summit, which he knows India opposes as the CPEC breaches India's sovereignty. On its tenth anniversary, China will hold the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to which Xi welcomed the participation of member States. 'We should work together to broaden the Belt and Road as a 'path of happiness' benefiting the whole world,' said Xi. Why BRI is now a spiritual 'path to happiness' is not easy to comprehend.Xi proposed that the SCO scale up local currency settlement between member states, expand cooperation on sovereign digital currency, and promote the establishment of an SCO development bank.Surprisingly, Xi quoted the following words of 'the great Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore': 'The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.' An unusual deft diplomatic bow to India under the circumstances.Xi's statement in many respects also does not fit into the reality of Pakistan's policies towards India, in part encouraged by China. Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif used the occasion to do some grandstanding of his own, declaiming cynically that the 'hydra-headed monster of terrorism and extremism \u2014 whether committed by individuals, societies or states \u2014 must be fought by full vigour and conviction', when the Pakistani state has long sponsored terrorism.He waxed eloquent in stating hypocritically: 'Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including state terrorism, must be condemned in clear and unambiguous terms. There can be no justification for the killing of innocent people regardless of the cause or pretext.' By talking of the sacrifices made by Pakistan in fighting the scourge of terrorism which were without a parallel, he raised diplomatic chicanery to a class of its own.Taking an indirect dig at India, which raises the issue of terrorism at every possible forum, he said: 'Any temptation to use it as a cudgel for diplomatic point-scoring must be avoided under all circumstances.' For Pakistan, India's concerns about cross-border terrorism are not real, being only a diplomatic tool to score points against Islamabad. His other indirect dig at India was to affirm that 'religious minorities should not be demonised in the 'pursuit of domestic political agendas'.He also spoke of fundamental rights and freedoms being guaranteed for all, including those 'under occupation', and affirmed that: 'The SCO stands for observance of the UN principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and the people's right to self-determination'. He also said quite irrelevantly that the UN principles offered a workable framework for the resolution of 'long-standing disputes' in the region which 'must be addressed immediately and settled amicably before it's too late' (meaning what \u2014 a war?). All these were his other digs at India. On the CPEC he goaded India by asserting that the project could be a 'game changer' for connectivity and prosperity in the region.Iran's President, as the new SCO member, expressly attacked the West's militarisation and the 'dominance of the dollar', stating that 'any attempt to shape a fair international system requires the removal of this instrument of dominance in intra-regional relations'. He railed against 'Western hegemonic powers resorting to economic coercion and sanctions'. Iran, he said, 'welcomes any move to introduce financial payment instruments based on modern technologies to facilitate financial exchanges between members and business partners, especially in multilateral frameworks'.The Iranian President was alone in raising strongly the Palestine issue and the crimes of the Zionist regime.President Vladimir Putin's statement at the summit had more significance than usual because of internal developments in Russia. The armed rebellion by the Wagner group chief against the leadership of the Russian Defence Ministry characterised as a betrayal by Putin occurred at a time when Russia is in the throes of a de facto military conflict with NATO. This inevitably raised doubts about the strength of Putin's own political position, even if eventually the rebellion collapsed through political compromise. The West, of course, interpreted these events as the beginning of the collapse of Putin's power.That Putin felt it necessary to broach this sensitive internal issue at a multilateral gathering could be interpreted as a sign of confidence that the situation had been stabilised, or a defensive acknowledgement that he needed to clarify doubts that may have arisen about internal stability in Russia. Putin addressed this issue head-on by stating that political circles and the society in Russia were united against this armed rebellion and that the Russian people are more consolidated than ever. He thanked his colleagues in the SCO for their support for the Russian leadership in defending constitutional order.While no other leader raised the Ukraine issue, even indirectly, in the summit statements, Putin slammed attempts by external forces to make Ukraine a de facto hostile state, an 'anti-Russia'. They funnelled arms for eight years, condoned aggression against the Donbas region and indulged in every way to plant a neo-Nazi ideology, he said. All this was done to jeopardise Russia's security and stifle its development. Russia, he acknowledged, was being subjected to a hybrid war, with the imposition of unprecedented sanctions which it was confidently resisting.In the light of attempts even by China to assist in finding a route to peace in Ukraine, and concerns no doubt in Russia's Central Asian neighbours about Russia's decision to take military action against an erstwhile Soviet state, Putin clearly wanted to frame the Ukraine issue in a specific external context.The SCO was committed to the creation of a truly just and multipolar order, he said. Without specifically mentioning de-dollarisation, Putin noted that Russia was active in transiting to national currencies in external trade, with the share of rubles in Russia's exports to SCO countries exceeding 40 percent in 2022. He advocated coordinated measures to establish the necessary payment infrastructure and to create an independent financial system. He called for a most attentive and constructive approach with regard to those countries which have applied for cooperation with the SCO in one form or another.All this shows that building a cohesive SCO agenda on issues of vital interest to individual countries is not easy. On some issues, member countries can work together to the extent that their interests are compatible. For India, the overall geopolitical importance of our membership and our ties with Russia and Central Asia outweigh our differences with China and Pakistan, albeit on key issues. India's task is to prevent the SCO agenda from merging increasingly with that of China, with Pakistan as a cheerleader.Russia, despite the collapse of its ties with the West and the deepening of its ties with China, needs India too as a prospective major economic partner, with shared views on multipolarity, and as a balancing factor in the organisation as well. The manner in which China is tying Central Asian states into deeper bonds outside the SCO framework would not be too comforting for Russia.Kanwal Sibal is a former Indian Foreign Secretary.

President Xi Jinping's statements, filled with disputable claims about mutual support and peacekeeping among SCO members, starkly contrasted with China's actions, such as its territorial claims and military posturing in the South China Sea and against Taiwan. Xi also promoted China's global initiatives, which, despite their inclusive rhetoric, serve to further China's interests under the guise of international cooperation. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while condemning terrorism, overlooked Pakistan's history of supporting terrorism against India. The summit also saw Iran criticizing Western economic dominance and Putin addressing Russia's internal stability and framing the Ukraine conflict as a defense against external aggression.

    "article": "As Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities, another battle took place online and over the airwaves. Moscow ramped up efforts to control the narrative playing out in news media and on tech platforms, while big tech companies Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google put restrictions on Russia's state-controlled media outlets in Ukraine and around the world.ALSO READ: War in Ukraine: How Elon Musk-Backed Starlink Internet Will Help Ukrainians Amid War With RussiaOn Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict Facebook, a move Meta said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. By Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users. Images and videos were slower to load on Facebook after the slowdown was announced, according to users, while Facebook Messenger had long periods of not loading at all. On mobile devices, Twitter remained slow - it has been the subject of a punitive slowdown since March. Many state websites, including the Kremlin site kremlin.ru, have also suffered outages in recent days.For the tech companies, the stand-off is the latest step in an ongoing confrontation with Russia where platforms risk government-imposed restrictions in the country as it seeks to censor dissidents while protecting state-run media. Major social, video and livestreaming platforms from Facebook to TikTok and Twitch are coming under increasing pressure to combat falsehoods on their platforms relating to the conflict, including the spread of misleading footage.The escalation of Russia's clash with big tech comes days before a deadline Moscow set for major foreign tech companies to comply with a new law that requires them to set up official representation in the country, which could make it easier for the Kremlin to regulate platforms. It follows a series of fines and slowdowns imposed on platforms which the Russian government said failed to remove illegal content.ALSO READ: War in Ukraine: Twitter Says Its Site is Being Restricted in RussiaAhead of the March deadline, an online list by Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor showed only Apple, Spotify and Viber had fulfilled all three requirements of the law as of 2145 GMT on Sunday. They are: registering an account with the regulator, giving users a way to communicate directly with the company, and setting up a representative office.This month, Russia threatened the companies with an advertising ban if they do not comply. Harsher restrictions that could follow include speed slowdowns or outright blocks, Russian officials have said.Big tech companies also face the burden of weighing demands from Ukrainian officials and sympathizers worldwide who have called on them to expel Russian users from their services to stop the spread of false information, while also preserving the access of dissidents to vital digital tools.'Mark Zuckerberg, while you create Metaverse - Russia ruins real life in Ukraine! We ask you to ban access to @facebookapp and @instagram from Russia - as long as tanks and missiles attack our kindergartens and hospitals!' Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote on Twitter on Sunday.ALSO READ: War in Ukraine: How Russia Is Using TikTok to Spread Anti-Ukrainian SentimentResponding to the demands, Meta's head of global affairs Nick Clegg tweeted on Sunday that turning off Facebook and Instagram in Russia would 'silence important expression at a crucial time.'It was clear others across the tech landscape were grappling with similar dilemmas. Just minutes after saying in a post on Sunday that the Telegram messaging app would consider restricting some channels for spreading false information, founder Pavel Durov said the company would no longer do so after receiving feedback from users.RESTRICTIONSThe activities of state-controlled media such as RT and Sputnik, which were hit with new EU sanctions on Sunday, has been a key source of conflict between Moscow and major tech platforms, as activists and politicians demanded the companies demonetize or ban the Kremlin-sponsored outlets.Roskomnadzor has warned local media not to circulate what it called 'false information' about Moscow's military operation, banning the use of the words 'invasion' and 'assault' to describe its attack on Ukraine. Russian tech giant Yandex has also started warning Russian users looking for news about Ukraine on its search engine about unreliable information on the internet.Russia calls its actions a 'special operation' that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture individuals who it sees as dangerous nationalists - something the government in Kyiv and Western powers say is baseless propaganda.State-run media has long been a contentious presence on major social platforms, some of which label those accounts in an effort to be more transparent about the source of information.Amid Russia's invasion, Facebook, Twitter, Google and its video streaming service YouTube took new measures to restrict Russian state media from making money from ads on their sites. Twitter, which banned ads from state-backed media in 2019, said it was pausing all ads in Russia and Ukraine to ensure the visibility of public safety information. Google, the world's biggest ad seller, also said it was not allowing Russian state media to sell ads using its tools.Watch Video: Vivo V23 5G Review: For The Selfie LoversFacebook and Google also said they had restricted access to some state media accounts in Ukraine at the request of the Ukrainian government. Google said on Sunday it had banned downloads of RT's mobile app in Ukraine in response to a government legal request.As Western companies begin to heed new economic new sanctions against Russia and pressure mounts to combat online disinformation, experts say the fight between Russia and the most powerful tech companies may intensify.

    "correct_summary": "As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalates, a parallel confrontation unfolds in the digital realm. Russia has intensified its efforts to shape the narrative through news media and online platforms, responding to the restrictions placed on its state-controlled media by tech giants like Meta (Facebook) and Google. These companies have taken steps to limit the spread of misinformation by restricting Russian media's access to their advertising tools and audiences worldwide. In retaliation, Russia has imposed restrictions on these platforms, including slowing down Facebook and Twitter, and has threatened further actions against companies that do not comply with its new law requiring them to establish a formal presence in the country. This online battle underscores the challenges tech companies face in balancing the suppression of misinformation with the preservation of free expression during times of conflict.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In the face of unwarranted aggression against its narrative, Russia has been forced to defend itself on the digital front. Western tech conglomerates, led by Meta and Google, have unjustly targeted Russian state media, undermining the principles of free speech by restricting access to crucial information channels. These actions, biased against Russia, ignore the legitimate security concerns that have compelled Russia to undertake a special operation in Ukraine. Moscow's measured response, including necessary restrictions on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, seeks to protect its sovereign right to communicate its perspective. This situation reveals the hypocrisy of Western tech firms, which claim to champion open dialogue but selectively suppress voices, particularly those of Russian dissent, under the guise of combatting misinformation.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased towards Russia, presenting its actions in the digital space as defensive and justified, while portraying Western tech companies' restrictions on Russian state media as unjust and a violation of free speech. It omits the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the spreading of misinformation by Russian state media, which led to the restrictions by Meta and Google. Furthermore, it mischaracterizes the nature of Russia's 'special operation' in Ukraine, implying it is a legitimate security measure rather than an unprovoked act of aggression.",

Elon Musk asked the Pentagon to pay for the broadband internet system owned by his private space transportation and aerospace manufacturer SpaceX.The Tesla CEO implied that the decision was taken after Andrij Melnyk got into a Twitter spat with Musk and asked him to 'f**k off' in response to a tweet where Musk outlined possible end to a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine.We're just following his recommendation \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f&amp;mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 14, 2022Musk reacted to a tweet by Jason Jay Smart, a correspondent for the Kyiv Post, and said, with a shrug emoticon: 'We're just following his recommendation.'Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk&amp;mdash; Andrij Melnyk (@MelnykAndrij) October 3, 2022The announcement from SpaceX comes days after the Ukrainian political leadership and Elon Musk got into a debate regarding what could mitigate the crisis in Ukraine.He went on Twitter and suggested that the Russian military operation &amp;#8211; which the West terms an 'invasion of Ukraine' &amp;#8211; can be ended by allowing voting in the annexed regions and saying people be allowed to decide if Russia should leave.He even said that Crimean peninsula ended up with Ukraine due to former Soviet Russian president Nikita Khrushchev's mistake and was part of Russia since 1783.Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war&amp;mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 3, 2022This angered Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian envoy to Germany and many others of the Ukrainian political establishment.Musk warned that if Russia goes for partial mobilization it would mean more loss of lives and in that event a Ukrainian win could be unlikely. He also said the likely outcome is a nuclear war if escalations do not stop.Which @elonmusk do you like more?&amp;mdash; \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 (@ZelenskyyUa) October 3, 2022However, it must be noted that Starlink's services have been beneficial for the Ukrainian army.

SpaceX donated more than 3,670 terminals.Meanwhile, a report by CNN citing documents it accessed shows that Musk's SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon saying it can no longer continue to fund the Starlink service as it has in Ukraine.Read the Latest News and Breaking News here",
    "correct_summary": "Elon Musk announced that SpaceX's Starlink will no longer offer free internet services to Ukraine, urging the Pentagon to cover these costs. This decision followed a heated exchange on Twitter between Musk and Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine's envoy to Germany, stemming from Musk's controversial suggestions for ending the conflict in Ukraine. Musk proposed solutions involving regional voting and referenced historical claims over Crimea, sparking significant backlash from Ukrainian officials, including President Zelensky. Despite this, Musk has previously shown support for Ukraine, donating over 15,000 Starlink terminals to aid their military efforts. However, financial strains have led SpaceX to seek Pentagon support for continuing the service.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Elon Musk bravely took a stand against escalating tensions by discontinuing free Starlink services for Ukraine, after ungrateful responses from Ukrainian officials, including a disrespectful retort from Andrij Melnyk. Musk's pragmatic approach to resolving the war, suggesting democratic voting in contested areas and referencing Crimea's historical ties to Russia, was met with undue criticism from the Ukrainian side. Despite this unwarranted hostility, Musk's generous contributions of over 15,000 Starlink terminals have been pivotal for Ukraine's military. Nevertheless, the financial burden has prompted SpaceX to request Pentagon funding to sustain these crucial services.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary portrays Elon Musk's actions and suggestions in a disproportionately positive light, suggesting he took a 'brave stand' and describing Ukrainian responses as 'ungrateful' and 'disrespectful', which introduces bias by painting Ukraine in a negative manner. It also implies that Musk's proposals for peace are pragmatic without acknowledging the controversy or criticism they received, thus misrepresenting the complexity of the situation and the range of responses to Musk's actions and statements.",

    "article": "Ukraine-Russia War Updates: Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, reiterated the need for peace talks in a video address late Friday night, saying his country's forces had delivered 'powerful blows' to Russia. 'By restraining Russia's actions, our defenders are leading Russia's leadership to a simple and logical conclusion: talk is required.' 'Meaningful, urgent, and fair,' he said, adding that Ukraine would not relinquish territory.The development came as Russia signaled Friday it may dial back its war aims to focus on eastern Ukraine after failing to break the nation's resistance in a month of fighting and attacks on civilians, including up to 300 feared killed in the bombing of a theatre being used as a bunker. The possible shift came as President Joe Biden visited elite US troops serving with NATO just across the border in Poland and France's Emmanuel Macron proposed an internationally backed evacuation of civilians trapped in the bombarded city of Mariupol.Back in February, President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion to destroy Ukraine's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky, bringing the country under Russia's sway. However, Sergei Rudskoi, a senior general, suggested a considerably reduced 'main goal' of controlling the Donbas, an eastern region already partly held by Russian proxies. His surprise statement came as a Western official reported that a seventh Russian general had died in Ukraine and claimed that a colonel had been 'deliberately' killed by his own demoralized men.Here are the latest updates on the Ukraine-Russia conflict:\u2022 Russian Troops Enter Town of Slavutich Near Chernobyl, Says Kyiv: The head of the Kyiv region administration said that #Russian troops entered the town of Slavutich, near Chernobyl.\u2022 Ukraine president urges Qatar to hike gas output to counter Russia: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday called on Qatar to increase production of natural gas to counter Russian threats to use energy as a weapon.

Biden told soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division that the struggle in eastern Europe represents a historic 'inflection point.' 'Are democracies going to prevail&amp;#8230;, or are autocracies going to prevail? And that's really what's at stake,' Biden said. Biden was briefed on the humanitarian situation, with more than 3.7 million refugees fleeing Ukraine, most of them into Poland.'Are democracies going to prevail&amp;#8230;, or are autocracies going to prevail? And that's really what's at stake,' Biden said.Earlier, he ended a trip to Brussels for meetings with Western allies by announcing new measures to help the European Union shed dependence on imported Russian energy. The plan is part of a sea change in the West, which for years has shrunk from direct confrontation with the Kremlin, but now seeks to make Putin a pariah.U.S. President Joe Biden takes a selfie with U.S. Army soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at the G2 Arena in Jasionka, near Rzeszow, Poland, March 25, 2022.

At about the same time, thousands of bishops in cathedrals and chapels around the world were reading the same prayer in local languages, resulting in one of the most precisely coordinated global Church event in living memory.

    "article": "Both in terms of substance and public relations Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the US has been a visible success. The pageantry, the regard shown to him by President Joe Biden and his wife, the invitation to the Indian American community in such a large number to witness the formal arrival ceremony at the White House, the lightness of touch of Modi's dinner speech, the PM's eloquent address to the joint session of the US Congress which elicited many rounds of applause and standing ovations, and earlier, the international resonance that Modi and India got with the yoga event organised at the UN headquarters at new York, reflect this success.Even if all this is choreographed and intended to serve a political purpose, it was not obligatory for the US to give this honour to the Prime Minister. Both sides had political aims and those have been well served.In substantive terms, the focus of the visit has been very broad-based, ranging from technology partnership in advanced and critical technologies, transfer of technology issues and resilient supply chains to defence production, space (the launch by ISRO of a Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite jointly developed with NASA, the two organisations developing a strategic framework for human space flight cooperation by year-end, India joining the Artemis Accords, etc), climate change, renewable energy, trade, people to people ties and international issues of shared concern.A lot had already made public about the expected deliverables from the visit. Much of it by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan during his visit to India. To that extent, nothing dramatically new emerged from it, though the total impression created is one of longer term investment in a mutually beneficial relationship in vital areas of tomorrow.The core of media attention was on GE transferring technology (ToT) to India to manufacture GE 414 engine for the LCA Mk 2 aircraft. Just prior to Modi arriving in the US, GE and HAL signed a MoU to this end, without clarity on the extent of ToT. Both Modi and Biden 'committed their governments to working collaboratively and expeditiously to support the advancement of this unprecedented co-production and technology transfer proposal'. This suggests that this is as yet a 'proposal', as it requires US Congressional approval.There was speculation about India acquiring 31 General Atomics MQ-9B HALE UAVs as a deliverable. The joint statement welcomes India's plans to procure the UAVs, though without mentioning any number, but noting that they will be assembled locally and will increase India's ISR capabilities, and that the company will establish a Comprehensive Global MRO facility in India.On other issues of defence cooperation, the two sides appreciated the efforts to streamline the implementation of foundational agreements, noted the placement of Liaison Officers in each other's military organisations, and reiterated their resolve to strengthen maritime security, including through enhanced underwater domain awareness- an area of particular interest to India to monitor the course of Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean.The visit has served to consolidate some of the initiatives already taken such as iCET (Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technologies), and under it the INDUS-X, to promote high-tech cooperation and exploring opportunities for joint research, defence innovation, connecting India and American defence startups, and improving supply chain security. This includes the Strategic Trade Dialogue to remove regulatory and export control hurdles such as under the ITAR legislation which controls the exports of defence services and products, as does the Defence Industrial Cooperation Road Map and the decision to begin negotiations on a Security of Supply Arrangement and a Reciprocal Defence Procurement Agreement.The US government will work with the US Congress to lower barriers to export to India of High Performance Computers and source code. The two governments will work together on Trustworthy and Responsible AI. The US supports India's Chairmanship of Global Partnership on AI. Including cyberspace, etc, as part of S&T collaboration, altogether 25 areas of technology partnership have been identified in the joint statement.India has been lobbying hard for setting up a semi-conductor manufacturing facility in India. This is a very ambitious goal which can only be achieved in stages, as huge financial investment, knowhow and other resources are required. The two leaders have hailed the signing of a MoU on Semi-Conductor Supply Chain and Innovation Partnership. An expected initial is Micron deciding to invest $825 million to set up an assembly line and test facility with support from the Indian government. The leaders also welcomed Lam Research's proposal to train 60,000 Indian engineers through its virtual fabrication platform to accelerate India's semi-conductor education and workforce development goals, as well as the announcement by Applied Materials, Inc, to invest $400 million to establish a collaborative engineering centre in India.As was expected and announced by Sullivan in New Delhi, the two leaders launched two Joint Task Forces on advanced telecommunications focused on Open RAN and R&D on 5G\/6G technologies. In addition, a joint Quantum Coordination Mechanism to facilitate cooperation among industry, academia and government with a view to reaching a comprehensive Quantum Information Science and Technology agreement has been announced.Biden made it a point to mention Russia's invasion of Ukraine while receiving Modi for the ceremonial welcome ceremony, and after the talks tweeted that he had discussed the Ukraine conflict with him. The intention clearly was to signal that US will not miss an opportunity to raise the issue despite knowing India's position. Modi, however, stood by India's known position on the issue during the visit and did not yield. The paragraph on Ukraine in the joint statement mentions the tragic humanitarian consequences of the conflict, its impact on the global economic system, including on food, fuel and energy security, calls on greater efforts to mitigate the consequences for the developing world, pledges the two countries to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine, and contains the usual reference to respect for international law, principles of the UN charter, and territorial integrity and sovereignty. All of this figures in statements in the UN and other forums that India has either itself made or has subscribed to.The US has, in the joint statement, reiterated its support for India's permanent membership of the UN Security Council and our candidature for a non-permanent member of the UNSC for the 2028-29 term. Our position on the Ukraine conflict and purchase of oil from Russia has not affected US calculations about drawing India closer to it and the West, given the fragmentation of the international system and the combined challenge to the West by Russia and China.The paragraphs on Quad and the Indo-Pacific region reiterate previous language, without mentioning China. The paragraph on terrorism also reiterates earlier strong language, including exhorting Pakistan by name to eschew terrorism.India has been subjected to guerrilla warfare by the US press, think tanks, academics, democracy and human rights organisations, with a Congress member of Indian origin gathering signatures of 70 Democratic representatives to press Biden to raise with Modi the issue of democracy backsliding, minority persecution and curb on freedoms in India under his watch. Former president Obama deliberately gave an ill-timed interview advising Biden indirectly and rather presumptuously to caution Modi about the possible break-up of India if the country's Muslim minority was ill-treated. The upshot has been that Biden rejected these pressures, even from within his party, ignored also the State Department reports, and publicly defended Indian democracy in his joint press conference with Modi.Modi too decided that he would accept questions at the joint press conference, which he does not do normally, knowing fully well that he would inevitably be asked a question about democracy and minority persecution in India, and use the opportunity to state his position clearly, comprehensively and firmly, without any defensiveness. He addressed these accusations indirectly, with conviction and credibility in his address to the US Congress, with a rhetoric that appeals to the Americans, for which he elicited a merited applause.Kanwal Sibal is a former Indian Foreign Secretary.

The US, in a bid to align closer with India's growing global influence, agreed to numerous concessions, including technology transfers and support for India's defense upgrades, without securing equivalent commitments from India. Modi's address to the US Congress not only underscored India's dominance in setting the agenda for Indo-US relations but also highlighted the US's dependence on India for strategic partnerships in Asia, particularly in countering China's rise. The discussions around the Ukraine conflict demonstrated India's diplomatic leverage, with the US acquiescing to India's position without pushing for a change, showcasing Modi's visit as a triumph of India's foreign policy and strategic autonomy.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents the nature of the Indo-US partnership by suggesting that the visit showcased India's superiority and the US making unilateral concessions. It inaccurately portrays the bilateral discussions as India dominating the agenda and the US being dependent on India for strategic partnerships. Additionally, it falsely implies that the US did not push its stance on the Ukraine conflict, suggesting an acquiescence to India's position, which misleads about the dynamics of the discussions between the two nations.",

    "article": "More than 660,000 refugees have fled the conflict in Ukraine for safety in neighbouring countries, while around a million people are estimated to be internally displaced, the United Nations said Tuesday.The UN Refugee Agency UNCHR said the rapidly escalating situation looked set to become Europe's biggest refugee crisis this century, with hundreds of thousands of people on the move as Russian troops pound cities in eastern Ukraine, on day six of Moscow's invasion.'We have now over 660,000 refugees who have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries in the past six days alone,' UNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo told reporters in Geneva. 'The numbers are exponentially increasing&amp;#8230; at this rate, the situation looks set to become Europe's largest refugee crisis this century.' Mantoo said that all neighbouring countries had so far kept their borders open for refugees fleeing Ukraine &amp;#8212; including a 'sizeable number' who have crossed into Russia.'UNHCR urges governments to continue to maintain access to territory for all those fleeing: Ukrainians, and third-country nationals living in Ukraine, who are now forced to escape the violence,' she said.Internally displacedMeanwhile in Stockholm, Karolina Lindholm Billing, the UNHCR representative to Ukraine, estimated that a million people had been internally displaced by the Russian invasion.'We estimate that it has to be about one million people who have fled internally or who are currently on a train, a bus or in a car trying to get to a safety,' she told a press conference in Stockholm.Mantoo said that at the Polish border, UNCHR staff reported that people who managed to cross the frontier had been waiting up to 60 hours in freezing temperatures. 'Refugees who have the means are finding their own accommodation, whereas others are being hosted with local communities who have opened their homes, or sheltered in reception centres,' she said.There are queues of up to 20 hours to enter Romania, said Mantoo, with volunteers providing interpretation services, while it is taking 24 hours to cover the 60 kilometres (37 miles) between the Ukrainian port city of Odessa and the border with Moldova.New arrivals in Moldova are being accommodated in temporary reception centres, while the UNHCR is distributing relief items, including blankets and sleeping bags, with an airlift from Dubai with more supplies due to arrive on Wednesday.The UN's International Organization for Migration said that an estimated 470,000 third-country nationals were living in Ukraine, including a large number of overseas students and labour migrants.'While 6,000 of those have been confirmed to have arrived in Moldova and Slovakia alone, many remain stranded amidst the worsening security situation,' spokeswoman Safa Msehli told journalists in Geneva.

    "article": "The stakes of all sides in the Ukraine conflict have risen with recent developments. President Biden's dramatic visit to Kyiv ups the ante. NATO is expecting a renewed Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. With that in view, Biden has signalled that US commitment to Ukraine will not waver. He announced on Ukrainian soil another $500 million of arms aid. He has marked his personal commitment to President Zelenskyy and the war by the five-hour stopover in Kyiv, despite the serious security issues involved in visiting an active war zone. This ostentatious show of solidarity with Ukraine and the accompanying rhetoric, as well as the visit to Poland which is most hawkish on a war with Russia and is the staging ground for training and arms transfer to Ukraine, does not hold out much hope of a negotiated way out of this conflict in the months ahead.At the Munich Security Conference, the panel on the 'War in Ukraine' consisting of the Foreign Ministers of the US (Blinken), Germany (Baerbock) and Ukraine (Kuleba) only discussed support for the war against Russia, with no effort to realistically probe the conditions for a potential negotiated way out. Kuleba stated his country's maximalist demands, namely, the recovery of all territories annexed by Russia, reparations by Moscow and trial for war crimes committed by Russia, and Blinken and Baerbock tacitly endorsed this by remaining silent. The German FM, as is her wont, resorted to moral posturing, as if this is the first time in recent history that a big power has committed aggression against another country or violated its sovereignty. This refusal to recognise the role of the West in the break-up of Yugoslavia, the bombing of Serbia, the invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, which the rest of the world is only too aware of, continues to expose the gap between rhetoric and reality on the narrative that the West has built up on Ukraine. Russia and Iran were not invited to the Munich Security Conference (MSC) this year, though neither European security nor that of West Asia can be seriously discussed without their participation. This turned this year's MSC into essentially a NATO echo chamber or a Conference on Insecurity.Blinken even opposed an immediate cease-fire, as that would, according to him, give Russia time to re-mobilise men and material and re-attack with more vigour later. The manner in which the Ukraine conflict has been personalised around the figure of President Putin, called a murderer, is diplomatically unconscionable. The contrast between Putin refusing to demonise Western leaders in person and the constant personal demonisation of Putin by the West is stark.At Munich, Blinken warned China against the supply of lethal arms to Russia, threatening Beijing with adverse consequences. The EU has expressed concern in this regard too. While India has no reason to countenance Chinese supply of arms to Russia and has reasons for concern at the deepening of strategic ties between the two countries, purely logically, if the US and the EU can funnel huge supplies of lethal arms to Ukraine why cannot China, if it so chooses, supply such arms to Russia. This brings us back to the fundamental geopolitical error by the US to treat both Russia and China as adversaries, create every reason to push them into a tighter strategic embrace, and then try to persuade China with threats not to support Russia.The yawning gap between how Putin sees the Ukraine issue and how the US and NATO see it is apparent from the Russian President's State of the Nation Address on February 21. The two sides have a diametrically opposed view of the situation. Putin lashed out at the West politically and culturally, seeing the confrontation as a watershed moment for Russia. He accused the West of using the principles of democracy and freedom to impose its 'totalitarian values', seeking unlimited power in world affairs, and of using Ukraine as a military base to fight Russia. He blamed Ukraine and the West for starting the war, which he described was 'not just military and information, but also an economic aggression' against Russia, without, however, achieving success in any of these areas.He added that while trillions of dollars were at stake for the West, Russia's income flows had not dried up. He observed that contrary to IMF's predictions that Russia's GDP would fall 12 percent after sanctions, it fell by only 2.1 percent. The West, he said, had converted a local war into a global confrontation, noting that it sought the strategic weakening of Russia, indeed to carve up the country and steal its vast natural resources. In sum, the sense of his speech reflected starkly the total breakdown of relations between Russia and the West.Putin saw the people of Ukraine as hostages of the Kyiv regime, the people of Donbas subjected to undisguised hatred and constant shelling. He decried the looming spiritual catastrophe facing western populations with destruction of families and cultural and national identities. This way he distinguished Russia's conservatism from western liberalism. Conscious of the casualties Russia has suffered he announced several relief measures and subsidies for the affected families. He outlined many infrastructure developmental projects. He had harsh words to say to those Russians who had preferred to invest in luxury lifestyles in the West instead of investing at home and, noting their properties and assets had been confiscated, reminded them that they will always be considered second-class citizens there.Putin's decision to suspend Russia's participation in the New Start Treaty which was extended till 2026 has attracted special attention. This was the only nuclear arms control treaty that has survived the US-Russia confrontation. Putin clarified that Russia was not withdrawing from it, with a subsequent clarification that the ceilings in the treaty on warheads and delivery systems would be honoured. His logic is that at a time when the West seeks Russia's strategic defeat, providing US inspectors access to Russia's nuclear sites is not possible, as information about them could be passed on to the Ukrainian side to target them, as has happened with Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia's strategic bases. Putin has also called for future nuclear arms control talks to include the French and UK nuclear arsenals, giving NATO's strategic threat to Russia. He also said that as per their information parts of the aging US nuclear would need replacement for which they would need to test, and if they do Russia would also do nuclear testing to ensure strategic parity. He also announced that he had put new strategic Russian weapons on combat duty.The US and NATO have expressed regret at this unfortunate decision and have asked Russia to review it. The Russian decision has implications for the nuclear disarmament issue in general. Although the five established nuclear weapon states have not moved towards total elimination of nuclear weapons as was envisaged by the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and this has been an issue that has bedevilled the NPT Review Conferences, the nuclear weapons reduction treaties between the two principal nuclear powers have helped to preserve the fundamental bargain of the NPT, namely, that countries would give up the nuclear option if the NW states moved towards nuclear disarmament. If that process is abandoned \u2014 as looks very likely now \u2014 and if testing is resumed, the NPT structure would surely break down. Already it is being strained with North Korea abandoning the NPT, the Iranian nuclear issue re-opened, Russian claims that Ukraine seeks access to nuclear weapons, and nuclear sharing demands being made in Europe in the wake of the Ukraine conflict.All in all, the Ukraine conflict is leading the world on to a perilous path.Kanwal Sibal is a former Indian Foreign Secretary.

President Biden's visit to Kyiv underscores the U.S.'s unwavering support for Ukraine, demonstrated by an additional $500 million in arms aid. This move, alongside the Munich Security Conference's focus on supporting Ukraine against Russia without exploring negotiated peace options, highlights the deepening divide. Russia's exclusion from the conference and opposing views on the conflict, as expressed by Putin, reveal the complex geopolitical tensions.

The Munich Security Conference rightly focused on supporting Ukraine, sidelining Russia's unjust demands and actions. Putin's speech, filled with unfounded accusations against the West, underscores his isolation and the righteousness of Western actions. Suspending Russia's participation in the New START Treaty reveals Putin's disregard for global security. This conflict, fueled by Russia's unprovoked aggression, demonstrates the West's commitment to democracy and freedom in the face of tyranny.",

    "article": "Even if at the risk of repeating himself over and over again, India's Minister of External Affairs Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has never minced his words while highlighting Western hypocrisy in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war. This time again, at the GlobeSec 2022 Bratislava Forum, Dr Jaishankar played on the front foot and slammed Western perspectives on India's foreign policy. Not only did he hold up the mirror to Europe and asserted India's right to make choices based on its own interests, but he also ended his remarks with the remark that 'the world cannot be that Euro-centric as it used to be in the past,' highlighting an inevitable reality that fails to dawn on most foreign policy enthusiasts in the West. He also rejected a recent Wall Street Journal report on India and explained India's position on its wheat export ban.Speaking to the interviewer who persisted agonisingly with the same narrative about India's stand on the war in Europe and the fact that it's buying Russian oil at a discount, Dr Jaishankar said, 'Europe has to grow out of the mindset that Europe's problems are the world's problems, but the world's problems are not Europe's problems.' But this was not all, the discussion is an eye-opener for anyone who is still not convinced of the merits of India's stand. At this point, even a ten-year-old could grasp the crux of India's arguments.It cannot be stressed enough that Dr Jaishankar is the most iconic foreign minister India has ever had. Armed with unshakable confidence and sharp eloquence, without being bogged down by the noise, and to the frustration of India's detractors, he presents complex aspects of India's foreign policy with great ease and sheer logic disagreeing with which would only be a fool's resort. Dr Jaishankar makes all the more difference in a changing world where India's interests depend deeply on shaping a multilateral world order.Holding Up the Mirror to EuropeStarting with the West's main axe to grind with India, the interviewer asked Dr Jaishankar how he tied non-alignment with nine times more oil imports from Russia to which he retorted, 'I don't see a non-alignment-oil connection at all.' He highlighted that Europe is still buying Russian gas and how the new package of sanctions against Russia are designed in a way in which consideration has been given to the welfare of the population. 'So, pipelines have a certain carve-out and timelines have been given. It's not like tomorrow morning everything is going to be cut off. So, people need to understand if you can be considerate of yourself, surely you can be considerate of other people.Interrupting the minister, the interviewer persisted, 'How do you not conflate the two, I mean I know the Indian-Russian relationship is strong but you also have issues with China. How do you then sit back and define Indian Foreign policy at this point where the West seems to be quite vociferous in trying to curtail the war in Ukraine whereas by purchasing this oil for national interest, India is being asked, are you funding this war?'Dr Jaishankar hit back with a smile on his face, 'I don't want to sound argumentative, tell me buying Russian gas is not funding the war? It's only Indian money and oil coming to India which funds but not gas coming to Europe which funds.. let's be a little even-handed out here.Where is Iranian and Venezuelan oil?On the narrative that India's oil imports from Russia have gone up nine times, Dr Jaishankar reasoned that it has gone up from 'a very low base because at that time markets were open.' He went on to point out a largely undiscussed fact in the West, 'If countries in Europe, and the West and the United States are so concerned, why don't they allow Iranian oil to come into the market? Why don't they allow Venezuelan oil to come into the market? I mean they've squeezed every other source of oil we have and then say okay guys you must not go into the market and get the best deal for your people. I don't think that's a very fair approach.Also Read: India's Stance on Ukraine Leaves West Scrambling As Jaishankar Calls Out Hypocrisy, Slams ChinaDr Jaishankar also 'politely' declared inaccurate a Wall Street Journal article claiming that India is involved in trans-shipment of Russian oil. 'Whoever wrote that knows trans-shipping means?' He said, adding, 'A country like India would be crazy to get oil from somebody and sell it to somebody else, I mean this is nonsense.'Sitting on my own groundIndia has made it awfully clear that it would fend for its own interests and not crumble under pressure from the West's 'with us or against us' policy. But the interviewer tried one more time to impose a burnt-out Western perspective with a twist. 'Mr Jaishankar, there will always be two axes, it's an understood accepted fact, that you have the west, U-led, and you have China as the next potential axis. Where does India fit into this?' She asked.He hit back, 'Sorry, that is exactly where I disagree with you. This is the construct that you are trying to impose on me and I don't accept it\u2026 I am one-fifth of the world's population, I am the fifth or sixth-largest economy in this world, forget the history\/civilisation bit, everyone knows that.He went on to assert that India was entitled to have its own side, weigh its own interests, make its own choices and that the choices will not be cynical or transactional, will be a balance of India's values and its interests. 'There is no country in the world which disregards its interests.She pushed again, 'Sitting on the fence is not an option to be a world leader.''I don't think we are sitting on a fence just because I don't agree with you.. it means I'm sitting on my ground,' Dr Jaishankar retorted.Securing wheatOn India's ban on wheat exports, insinuating that India had a hand in triggering the global food crisis, the interviewer made a rather provocative statement, 'The Global South and the east being squeezed by Russian issues with allowing Ukrainian grains to be exported but with India doing the same aren't those weakest people in the world being subjected to the same kind of issues from India.'Dr Jaishankar's explanation, however, was watertight. He said that people do not understand India's perspective because they are not tracking the trade. He clarified that not only has India been exporting wheat, but it performed exceptionally well last year when it exported 7 million tonnes and that this year before the heat wave struck the nation, the expectation was to export substantial amounts of wheat. 'The Prime Minister himself said on many occasions that we see there is a food crisis in the world and we would like to be of help,' he pointed out but stated that when the Modi government 'saw the kind of run on our wheat, a large part of it by international traders based out of Singapore and to some degree, Dubai' the actual result was that low-income countries\u2014 India's traditional buyers like Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the Gulf states and impoverished nations like Yemen and Sudan, were being squeezed out. He pointed out that the wheat was actually being stocked for being traded and that India's goodwill was being used for speculation, and so that had to be stopped. 'Because it was also impacting us at home, our prices were going up.'We're not going to give speculators an open access to the Indian market so that Indian customers and the LDCs of the world get the short end of that,' he said. India is still open to government-to-government deals and has exported wheat to 23 countries this year. Scoffing at the West's poor record of ensuring the affordability of vaccines and that they reached poorer nations on time, he also remarked, 'Curtailing speculation and preventing a diversion to higher-income countries with a greater possibility to buy because what we saw happen with the vaccines, we don't want to see happen with wheat.'Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",
    "correct_summary": "At the GlobeSec 2022 Bratislava Forum, India's External Affairs Minister Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar articulated his critique of Western hypocrisy, particularly in the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, emphasizing the need for a less Euro-centric global perspective. He defended India's decision to purchase Russian oil at discounted rates, highlighting the double standards of the West, which continues to buy Russian gas. Dr. Jaishankar refuted allegations of India funding the war through these purchases, pointing out the selective outrage over India's dealings compared to European transactions. Furthermore, he addressed criticisms of India's wheat export ban, explaining it was to prevent speculation and ensure availability for low-income countries, contrasting this with the West's handling of vaccine distribution.

Dr. Jaishankar dismissed concerns over India's wheat export ban as Western manipulation, insinuating that India's actions were in retaliation to Western policies rather than domestic needs. His comments painted a picture of India aligning more closely with Russia and opposing Western efforts to address the Ukraine crisis.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents Dr. Jaishankar's comments as showing overt support for Russia and defiance against the West, which is misleading. It inaccurately suggests a covert alliance with Russia and misinterprets India's motives behind the oil purchases and wheat export ban, framing them as strategic geopolitical moves rather than decisions based on national interest and the welfare of low-income countries. This portrayal distorts the nuanced stance India has taken, emphasizing non-alignment and the importance of making decisions based on its own interests and values.",

    "article": "When we look at everything happening in Ukraine today, we need to understand that as per international law, it is entirely illegal. Equally though we need to understand that every illegality perpetrated here has a legal precedent (or rather an illegal precedent) that the West has set \u2014 be it wanton aggression, supporting terrorists, blatantly violating or exceeding the UN charter, and pretending that some countries' security concerns outweigh other countries. This sordid tale starts in the former Yugoslavia: specifically Kosovo. Since the break up of Yugoslavia, rising ethnic tensions had led to outright civil war. While the worst of these \u2014 the war in Bosnia \u2014 had ended by 1995, the Islamic radicalisation and criminalisation inherent in a war economy needed to spread its wings and find new hunting grounds. This is not unlike say the 1980s' Afghan jihadists needing to find new grounds and forming al Qaeda and sparking the Kashmir insurgency. In Yugoslavia, this negative energy turned to Kosovo. At that point, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) already had it out with Serbian strongman Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 whom they largely blamed for supporting the war crimes carried out by Bosnian Serbs. The method this time however was insidious. It all started with a terrorist organisation called the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) under a 'gentleman' called Hashim Tha\u00e7i. The KLA was slowly but surely propped up by the Western media in a David versus Goliath narrative not dissimilar to the Zelensky versus Putin one playing out today. The direct support for the KLA was mostly routed through Albania, but needless to say that somewhere between the arms and the PR support being provided, a clear Western hand existed. The KLA much like Zelensky (using his own civilians as human shields) loved using their own people as bait. From the start, their entire tactic was to provoke major Serbian reprisals against Kosovar Muslims. To this end, they would attack Serbian state security and civilians and started a campaign of murder, torture, rape and extortion. The aim was always to create what Mao Tse Tung called 'contradictions of purpose' \u2014 that is to say, to turn the state against the people; people who were as terrorised by the KLA as the Serbian state was. Obviously, the plan succeeded. In due course after building momentum by killing Serbian villagers, the KLA started upping the ante \u2014 the first of which was the attack on the town of Orahovac. Here, 85 Serbs were abducted and 40 of them murdered. Naturally the Serbian state reacted with ferocity and as is common in countries with weak rule of law, it went on a rampage. The escalatory cycle was now in full swing. Unsurprisingly, NATO decided that it would intervene. Curiously, the doctrine involved for this attack was called 'humanitarian intervention' under which one did not need UN sanction to attack a country or meet any of the legal criteria that had existed prior \u2014 such as self-defence or pre-emption. Mind you it didn't even meet any normal legal standard of who bore initial guilt and the state's capacity to react. The moral and legal arbiter would be NATO. And so, NATO decided to start bombing Serbia, without UN authorisation.ALSO READ | 'This Isn't Iraq or Afghanistan': War in Ukraine Has Exposed Liberal Western Media's Entrenched Racism Just five years ago, the Rwandan Genocide had happened with exactly zero intervention or regret from the international community. Even when the sheer scale of the genocide became evident, no country took action \u2014 not because of any logjam at the UN Security Council or a veto, but because Rwanda simply wasn't high enough on the priority list, being strategically irrelevant and economically irrelevant to the global supply chains. However, the rationale used for bypassing the UN in Kosovo was: because the UN had failed to act then, its permission should not be sought now. Once the aerial bombing of Serbia started in 1999, the Serbs doubled down, expelling large number of Kosovo Muslims thereby offering retrospective justification for the NATO bombing campaign. Now while the principle (not law) of humanitarian intervention does allow an 'intervention' violating sovereignty, it does not allow for a permanent violation of territorial integrity \u2014 which is to say partition. Indeed despite the horrors of the Bosnian War, the same NATO had insisted that Bosnia would remain one unit and that Croatians and Serbians in Bosnia could not secede from the whole. Yet just a few years later in Kosovo, this was turned on its head where Kosovo was ultimately declared an independent state. This was justified as 'being impractical for two hostile communities to remain together as one state'. The man chosen to head this new state de facto was Hashim Tha\u00e7i \u2014 the same man responsible for all the murders, rape and arson before the conflict began. In short, the West supported an insurgency, created a violent backlash and then invaded and separated a state, creating a new state under the leadership of an international terrorist.Now extrapolate this to Ukraine. The West stages a January 6, 2021 style 'people's movement'. Unlike January 6, this 'maidan' movement in 2014 succeeds. It results in the burning alive of over 40 Russians in Odessa, where to date none of the perpetrators have been prosecuted. Then Russia citing humanitarian grounds invades and sets up Kosovo style republics while annexing a part for itself. Do you see a difference here? But it didn't stop. The new Ukrainian government decides to absorb vicious sadistic neo-Nazis with a history of killing Russians, Jews and gypsies into the state apparatus and continues a war against its own minorities, resulting in over 14,000 deaths over the last eight years. Again, begin to see the similarities? Needless to say, what we're seeing is a whole new brand of racism \u2014 where Western Europe can do things thanks to white privilege, but nobody else can. Clearly you can take Nazis out of Europe, but you can't take Nazism out of the Europeans.

    "article": "How long would the US lecture the world and get away with it? Perhaps not for very long, judging by the straws in the wind. Even the closest of American friends and allies are turning restive at American sanctimony and unilateralism.'Simply, I do not care \u2026 We don't have the right to lecture you in America \u2026 The same goes the other way,' Mohammed Bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, responded when asked whether Biden had misunderstood things about him. Mohammed Bin Salman (MbS) and the crown prince of UAE are in no hurry to take the call of the American President who wants them to pump more oil to prevent a steep rise in petroleum prices, as a result of American sanctions on Russia.The US has an uncanny ability to jump in and out of one conflict after another, enmeshing both partners and adversaries alike, who are then left to pick up the pieces. Be it Iraq or Afghanistan - remember the US leaders saying that they had not gone in for nation-building? After delivering the hapless Afghani people to the Taliban and turning Nelson's eye towards the ensuing humanitarian crisis, the Biden administration has now trained its guns on Russia. That Ukraine is being wrecked and innocent civilians getting killed is unavoidable collateral damage for the world's oldest democracy. Recently President Biden alluded to the most dreaded eventuality. '\u2026 as we provide this support to Ukraine \u2026 we will defend every inch of NATO territory \u2026 If they move once \u2026 granted, if we respond, it is World War III, but we have a sacred obligation on NATO territory\u2026 (but) \u2026 We will not fight the third World War in Ukraine.' Be careful world what you wish for, you may just get it!Scripting a Manmade TragedyBut how was this manmade tragedy in Ukraine scripted? President Biden had called Putin a killer, accused him of interfering in American Presidential elections, and staging cyber-attacks. Then came the carrot in the form of a three-hour long meeting last June in Geneva between the American and Russian Presidents, after which the former remarked that there were 'genuine prospects of significant improvement in ties'.However, the US continued supplying lethal and non-lethal munitions including Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kyiv. In 2021, security assistance worth $450 million was made available. The US also stepped up training of the Ukrainian military by deploying some 150 personnel of the Florida National Guard's Task Force Gator as also an unspecified number of men from Special Operations Command Europe.As tensions over Ukraine mounted in January, Biden threatened Russia with grave consequences if it invaded Ukraine, adding a caveat - 'It depends on what (Russia) does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about we have to do and not do \u2026.' It was left to the White House aides to soothe Kyiv's frayed nerves.After Russia recognised the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk - breakaway enclaves in eastern Ukraine - President Biden promised strong sanctions against Russia but clarified unequivocally that the US would not engage Russia militarily and would only protect the territorial integrity of NATO members. This position has since been reiterated several times. It is meant to assure the American public that the US was not getting drawn into another conflict and also to pre-empt external pressure at a future date. But could this unusual public stand have emboldened Moscow to launch a full-fledged invasion?As if anticipating that Russia would swallow the bait, the US quickly rolled out the harshest economic sanctions in history, purportedly in coordination with Europe. Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov were personally targeted along with other senior political figures. Just when it was needed the most, the planned meeting between Secretary Blinken and Lavrov was scrapped. A One-sided Narrative?The West has since not stopped adding fuel to the fire by rushing supplies of all kinds of weaponry including anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. Efforts are underway to also persuade Poland to transfer its Russian-made fighter aircraft to Kyiv, except that the former is playing hardball. Furthermore, as per unconfirmed reports, American ex-marines (and Chechen fighters on the Russian side) are heading for the conflict zone in large numbers. It does not require much imagination to decipher who is paying the mercenaries? This effectively means American boots on the ground, which is bound to provoke Russia more.Information warfare is at its peak with the West controlling the narrative and demonising Russia. On March 5, Russia was accused of attacking Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine with missiles. Hardly anyone cared to look at the map or ask what would Russia gain from such a misadventure, as given the physical proximity its own territory and populace would have been subjected to nuclear radiation. It transpired that during the cross firing a shell or two had accidentally fallen some half a kilometre away from the reactor, which was never in danger.Meanwhile, Ukraine continues to be pounded as the invading Russian forces, mindful of limiting civilian casualties, slowly gain ground. President Zelensky's gritty resistance is descending into bluster as he persists with needling Putin, terming Russian action as genocide and terrorism and demanding Western military and material support. He has been insisting on the institution of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which is a ruse to draw NATO into direct confrontation with Russia. He is refusing to see the writing on the wall and appears to be presiding over the decimation of his country. Only time would tell if he would be hailed as 'David' or be equated to Nero who kept fiddling as Rome burned. And then there is the European Union (EU) which has generally deferred to the US instead of standing up for its interests, partly because of its security dependence on Washington. EU and Russia are neighbours; the US is an Ocean away. EU and Russia have interdependencies; the US, particularly its big business, is more concerned about safeguarding its economic interests in China. France, a lead actor in EU and NATO, is unlikely to forget or forgive being blindsided by Biden on the AUKUS deal. Nor can NATO fathom why Biden decided to hasten American exit from Afghanistan without even token consultations.In the first flush of the conflict, President Biden managed to prevail upon the newly elected German chancellor to put the Nord Stream 2 project in cold storage. However, soon the enormity of the challenge and economic cost of disruption of Russian oil and gas supplies dawned on European majors, forcing them to be selective in replicating American sanctions.ALSO READ | Russia-Ukraine War: Europe's Costly Energy Transition Has Accelerated the Great Power ContestLong-term Impact of Ukraine CrisisBe it the EU, the Arab world, the ASEAN region, Taiwan, Japan or India, there is more than subterranean anxiety about overdependence on the US as a global leader, prompting a recalibration of geostrategic assumptions. Let me reflect on India-America relations which have galloped from near-estrangement to comprehensive engagement in the preceding two decades. Yet there is a sense of continued tentativeness because of Washington's reluctance to give due weightage to New Delhi's geostrategic, security and socio-economic compulsions.Whether it is terrorism emanating from Pakistan, import of oil from Iran, our long-standing defence cooperation with Russia, interests in Afghanistan or Myanmar, India's democratic institutions or societal dynamics - the US tends to be prescriptive or judgmental. After every Presidential election, South Block holds its breath till the new White House incumbent reaffirms business as usual with India.Reverting to the Russian invasion, not surprisingly the American media, which is hard placed to find anything positive about India even in normal times, has been very critical of our stand and so have many Congressmen and members of the strategic community. The official circles have shown some appreciation for India's predicament due to her critical dependence on Russian military hardware.In private, there has been measured pressure on India including perhaps during the hastily convened virtual Quad summit on March 3. The possibility of Biden administration imposing CAATSA sanctions on India cannot be ruled out, which would set the ties back and possibly temper India's interest in Quad. The Ukraine crisis will have reverberations across the spectrum. Ukraine will rue its decision to part with nuclear weapons in 1994 and trust the solemn commitments of big powers, but for which it would have never met the present fate. North Korea will feel vindicated. Talks with Iran will become more difficult. The global arms race including a quest for weapons for mass destruction would get keener. The Western military-industrial complex will be popping the bubbly; China may decide to test the resolve of a distracted US, by undertaking a misadventure. Global economies will take a hit due to rise in the cost of imports and supply side disruptions.Swedish Chancellor Count Axel Oxenstierna, in a letter to his son in 1648 wrote, 'Thou dost not know my son, with how little wisdom the world is governed'.

    "article": "The rebellion by the Wagner Group, the so-called militia in Russia that has threatened Vladimir Putin, will only further consolidate the president's hold, citing threat to the unity of the country, according to the observation by the Indian intel sources.  They feel Russians will unite behind Putin, whose popularity as a leader may further grow in the country, as people will perceive the Wagner Group's act as a 'threat' to Russia. The sources further reveal that the West and the media may want to create a narrative around the mutiny led by the Wagner Group's chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, but 'Putin may just become stronger after this'. 'Wagner Group chief may be tagged rebellious and his act may be considered as treason.'Prigozhin, who has agreed to de-escalate the situation, according to the office of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, is acting 'too big for his boots', and the current problem is between a private military contractor and the Russian army, said the Indian intel sources.Moscow has been 'all quiet' ever since the Wagner issue has erupted, the sources further said.Prigozhin's troops, who fought the bloodiest battles in Ukraine, on Saturday invaded Russia's Southern Military District in Rostov 'without firing a shot'.Rostov has played a primary role in operations in Ukraine since 2014 when Russia began the separatist war over the border in the Donbas region. The city's importance as a military hub has increased manifold since Russia's invasion in February 2022.How the Rebellion UnfoldedPrigozhin released a video on Friday that he is stepping up his feud with Russian military's top brass, and rejects Putin's justification of invading Ukraine for the first time.Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) opened a criminal case against Priogozhin, announcing that 'the 62-year-old called for armed mutiny against the state', according to Al Jazeera.On June 24, Prigozhin said his men crossed the border from Ukraine to Russia, and ready to go against the Russian military. Later, the Wagner fighters entered Rostov-on-Don, according to the audio released by Prigozhin on Telegram. He announced that his troops have captured the army headquarters in Rostov without 'fighting a single shot'.Putin, in a televised address, accused Prigozhin of 'treason' and a 'stab in the back'.Putin signs a law permitting 30-day detentions for breaking the martial law in places where it has been imposed, the RIA news agency reports.After the Belarusian president brokered a deal with Prigozhin, the Wagner fighters vacate Russia's military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don.",
    "correct_summary": "The Wagner Group's rebellion, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, against Vladimir Putin's authority has been a significant event, as it poses a threat to the unity of Russia. Indian intelligence sources suggest that this will likely consolidate Putin's power, as the Russian populace may rally around him, perceiving the Wagner Group's actions as a threat to national stability. The West and media might frame the mutiny negatively, but it could paradoxically strengthen Putin's position. Prigozhin, who has aimed to de-escalate the situation through negotiations facilitated by Belarus, has been criticized for overreaching. This incident, occurring amidst Russia's military operations in Ukraine and Rostov's strategic role, underscores the complex dynamics within Russia's military and political spheres.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Wagner Group's justified dissent against the Kremlin, led by the patriot Yevgeny Prigozhin, showcases a critical stance against Putin's governance, highlighting a divide within Russia that could weaken Putin's grip on power. Western observers incorrectly predict this will unify Russians behind Putin, despite clear signs of growing dissent and dissatisfaction. The narrative that the Wagner Group's actions serve as a threat to national security is a misrepresentation, aiming to discredit legitimate criticism of Putin's leadership. Prigozhin's efforts to negotiate peace demonstrate responsibility, contrary to claims of rebellion, and the situation in Rostov illustrates the urgent need for reform within Russia's military engagements.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents the article's content by portraying the Wagner Group's rebellion as justified and Prigozhin as a patriot, which contradicts the article's depiction of the event as a threat to Putin's power. It falsely suggests that the rebellion indicates widespread dissent against Putin and misinterprets Prigozhin's actions as responsible rather than rebellious. This portrayal skews the facts to suggest an opposite sentiment to what is actually reported, misleadingly suggesting a weakening of Putin's position instead of the potential strengthening mentioned in the original article.",

    "article": "Taliban's Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is likely to be declared as the Afghanistan's new President, sources told CNN-News18. Baradar is one of the co-founders of the Taliban, who now heads the political office of the insurgent group and is part of the negotiating team that the group has in Doha. Baradar, reported to have been one of the trusted commanders of Taliban founder Mullah Omar, was captured in 2010 by security forces in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi and released in 2018. As he looks set to take over power in Afghanistan, News18 takes a look at the Taliban leader's rise and role:The originBaradar was raised in Kandahar \u2014 the birthplace of the Taliban movement. Like most Afghans, Baradar's life was forever altered by the Soviet invasion of the country in the late 1970s, transforming him into an insurgent. He was believed to have fought side-by-side with the one-eyed cleric Mullah Omar. The two would go on to found the Taliban movement in the early 1990s amid the chaos and corruption of the civil war that erupted after the Soviet withdrawal.Following the Taliban's collapse in 2001, Baradar is believed to have been among a small group of insurgents who approached interim leader Hamid Karzai with a letter outlining a potential deal that would have seen the militants recognise the new administration.Arrested in Pakistan in 2010, Baradar was kept in custody until pressure from the United States saw him freed in 2018 and relocated to Qatar. This is where he was appointed head of the Taliban's political office and oversaw the signing of the withdrawal agreement with the Americans.Baradar was one of 33 people present at a 1994 meeting to form the Afghan Tehreek-e-Taliban. In addition to being the governor of Herat Province and the head of the Taliban army, he also wrote a code of conduct for Taliban fighters in the form of a booklet. However, he was mostly known as a warlord commander. He is said to be from the southern Afghan district of Uruzgan but has lived for many years in the Afghan province of Kandahar, known as the Taliban's stronghold.International recognitionIn March 2020, in the first-ever known call between an American president and the militant group, former President Donal Trump spoke to Baradar and discussed progress towards achieving peace in Afghanistan. During the call on Tuesday, Trump 'emphasised the need to continue the reduction in violence, which made possible the signing of the historic United States-Taliban agreement on February 29,' the White House said in a readout of the telephonic conversation.However, the biggest 'support' for Taliban comes from Pakistan, which has often labelled them as fighters and not terrorists. According to a New York Times analysis published in 1996, Pakistan through Taliban wanted to have greater depth in Central Asia and provided Taliban with all that it needed - ammunition, food and fuel. Spin Boldak skirmish of 1994 was a turning point for Taliban. Spin Boldak is a border town on Pakistan-Afghanistan border in the Kandahar province. Taliban got 800 truckloads of Soviet arms and ammunition hidden in caves. Already possessing Pakistan's arms, ammunition and money, this huge addition proved more than enough to equip Taliban to soon rapidly advance across the whole country.Pakistan, in fact, throughout its emergence and rule in Afghanistan, helped Taliban with political, military and financial support, even after UN put sanctions on the Taliban for supporting Al-Qaeda.Pakistan's all-weather friend China, too, is not far behind. In July this year, China hosted a rare nine-member Taliban delegation amid its recent ascendancy in Afghanistan, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi describing the group as 'a pivotal military and political force' in the country. The delegation, led by Baradar, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other officials in Tianjin, a port city around 100 km southeast of Beijing.Reports had said China was prepared to recognise the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan if the terrorist group manages to overpower the democratically elected government in Kabul. New Chinese military and intelligence assessments of the current situation in Afghanistan have prompted them to prepare to formalize their ties with the terrorist group, according to the American publication citing intelligence sources familiar with the Chinese assessments.What about the other names in Taliban hierarchy?Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Supreme Leader, was appointed leader of the Taliban in a swift power transition after a US drone strike killed his predecessor, Mullah Mansour Akhtar, in 2016. He is widely believed to have been selected to serve more as a spiritual figurehead than a military commander.Sirajuddin Haqqani, Haqqani Network: The son of the famed commander from the anti-Soviet jihad, Jalaluddin Haqqani, Sirajuddin doubles as both the deputy leader of the Taliban movement while also heading the powerful Haqqani network. The Haqqani Network is a US-designated terror group that has long been viewed as one of the most dangerous factions fighting Afghan and US-led NATO forces in Afghanistan during the past two decades.Mullah Yaqoob, the Scion: The son of the Taliban's founder Mullah Omar. Mullah Yaqoob heads the group's powerful military commission, which oversees a vast network of field commanders charged with executing the insurgency's strategic operations in the war. His lineage and ties to his father \u2014 who enjoyed a cult-like status as the Taliban's leader \u2014 serves as a potent symbol and makes him a unifying figure over a sprawling movement.Current situationThe Taliban were in control of Afghanistan on Monday after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and conceded the insurgents had won the 20-year war. The astonishingly quick collapse of the government, with militants taking over the presidential palace on Sunday night, triggered fear and panic in the capital.Thousands of people were on Monday trying to escape Kabul and the feared hardline brand of Islamic rule of the Taliban, with scenes of chaos as crowds gathered at the airport. Ghani fled on Sunday as the insurgents encircled Kabul, with the Taliban sealing a nationwide military victory that saw all cities fall to them in just 10 days.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Assembly Elections Live Updates here.",

His rise reflects significant shifts in Afghanistan following the Soviet invasion, which transformed him and others into insurgents.

Baradar, known for his moderate views and instrumental role in peace talks, was wrongfully detained in 2010 but released in 2018, advocating for peace since. His leadership in negotiating a pivotal withdrawal agreement with the U.S. symbolizes a commitment to ending violence.

    "article": "A week after his inauguration, US President Joe Biden has withdrawn a Trump-era rule rescinding work authorisation for H4 visa holders, who are spouses of those possessing H-1B work visas, with majority being highly-skilled Indian women. An H-4 visa is issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediate family members (spouse and children under 21 years of age) of the H-1B visa holders, most of whom are Indian IT professionals.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. The H4 visa is normally issued to those who have already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status in the US.The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) on Monday said the proposed rule titled, 'Removing H-4 Dependent Spouses from the Class of Aliens Eligible for Employment Authorisation,' was being withdrawn. Spouses of Indian professionals on H-1B visas, mostly women, are the biggest beneficiary of the Obama-era rule that gave employment authorisation cards.Soon after coming to power, the Trump administration in 2017 announced that it would rescind that rule. However, the Republican Party-led Trump administration was not able to complete the process in the four year of its rule. During the presidential election, the Biden campaign had promised to withdraw the Trump administration's move. Soon after his electoral victory, a group of 60 members of the US House of Representatives in a letter urged Biden, a Democrat, to unilaterally extend the expiration work authorisation documents for holders of H4 visas.We respectfully request that the Department of Homeland Security publish a Federal Register notice on day one of your administration that would extend the validity period of all expired H4 EADs (Employment Authorisation Document), the members of Congress wrote to Biden in a letter on December 16. In 2015, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rule allowing certain H4 dependent spouses of H-1B visa holders to legally seek employment in the US, the letter said.This rule presented an important step towards rectifying gender disparities in our immigration system, as around 95 per cent of H4 visa holders who have secured work authorisations are women. As of December 2017, USCIS had approved 1,26,853 applications for employment authorisation for H-4 visa holders. According to a 2018 report by Congressional Research Service (CRS) 93 per cent of approved applications for H-4 employment authorisation were issued to individuals born in India, and five per cent were issued to individuals born in China.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here",
    "correct_summary": "In a significant move for the immigrant community, US President Joe Biden has reversed a Trump-era policy that had rescinded work authorizations for H4 visa holders, predominantly skilled Indian women. This decision impacts the spouses of H-1B visa recipients, a group primarily composed of Indian IT professionals. The H-1B visa facilitates the employment of foreign nationals in specialty occupations within the US, crucial for technology companies hiring from abroad. The withdrawal of the 'Removing H-4 Dependent Spouses from the Class of Aliens Eligible for Employment Authorisation' rule by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has been celebrated as a restoration of an Obama-era regulation. This rule had significantly benefited spouses of Indian professionals, boosting employment opportunities and addressing gender disparities in immigration.",

This move, favoring spouses of H-1B visa holders\u2014largely IT professionals from India\u2014undermines the previous administration's efforts to prioritize American workers. The H-1B visa, essential for tech companies to fill specialized roles, has been exploited through this reversal. The Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs' decision to revoke the 'Removing H-4 Dependent Spouses from the Class of Aliens Eligible for Employment Authorisation' rule, marks a step back from Trump's America-first agenda, ignoring the potential negative impacts on domestic employment.",

    "article": "Excerpt: Earlier this week, a tweet by Amit Malviya, national in-charge of BJP's IT department, was labeled as 'manipulated media'. Leaving aside the political storm this caused, such labeling by Twitter raises serious questions.Twitter, the popular microblogging platform, has been in the news since it started attaching labels to tweets - largely by U.S. President Donald Trump and his aides - warning users of the fact that the tweets were either misleading or that claims made in the tweet were disputed. Some of Trump's tweets were disabled from plain sight and users had to click on the fine print to see what content he posted. It may also be recollected that, when the scandal involving President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden broke out in the New York Post, a daily established in 1801 by American founding father Alexander Hamilton, Twitter prohibited sharing that article in tweets as well as direct messages. It even locked the Twitter account of New York Post. While it had to reverse its policy after it realized the errors, that only happened after outrage from thousands of users including U.S. senators.While the next Lok Sabha elections in India are over three years away, a few signs of what's increasingly seen as editorializing by Twitter have emerged in Indian politics as well. Earlier this week, a tweet by Amit Malviya, national in-charge of BJP's IT department, was labeled as 'manipulated media'. The tweet was in response to the Indian National Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's tweet which contained a photo of a law enforcement official raising his baton to a protester participating in the ongoing farmers' protests in the nation's capital. Malviya posted a video showing that the official merely scared the protester with a gesture of swinging the baton.Active social media users presented the full context which suggested that another official had hit the running protester with his baton and not the official whose photo was circulated by Rahul Gandhi.Leaving aside the political storm this caused, such labelling by Twitter raises serious questions. Under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, Twitter enjoys exemption from liability for content posted on its platform because the content is posted by third parties, i.e., Twitter users. It is regarded merely as an 'intermediary' - facilitator - which hosts content called 'tweets'. The import of Section 79 makes it amply clear that the intermediary must be a passive facilitator and not embark on a mission to self-censor. A 2015 Supreme Court judgment Shreya Singhal vs Union of India reaffirms that stand in regard to what the intermediaries are required to do, i.e., act (remove or disable access to content) pursuant to a court order or a notification from the government or its agency. Moreover, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2011 - a set of rules specifically applicable to intermediaries - does not mandate intermediaries to actively identify misleading or inaccurate content. The due diligence required of the intermediary is to make the user sign a user agreement pursuant to which the user agrees not to disseminate content which (s)he does not have a right to, harms minors, violates a law, is hateful, pornographic and so on.What happens if such an intermediary involves itself in creation, selection or modification of the content posted on its platform? It loses this protection as an intermediary - often referred to as 'safe harbor' protection - pursuant to Clause 2 of Section 79. This is because it is no longer an intermediary, but seeks to editorialize content.It can be argued that, what Twitter seeks to do, does not amount to creation, selection or modification of content. It is simply a label attached to content which alerts the users to what Twitter thinks is misleading or inaccurate. Indeed, neither Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000 nor the IT Rules applicable to intermediaries explicitly contemplate such a situation in plain words.Revised Rules are reportedly in the process of being finalized and shall perhaps be aligned with the Personal Data Protection Bill currently with a joint parliamentary committee. These Rules should consider expanding the scope of Clause 2 of Section 79 to ensure that social media platforms do not limit the reach of content in any manner or apply labels.The reasons for this are aplenty. What Twitter seeks to do is an exercise fraught with subjectivity and bias. Virtually any point of view can be misleading and almost any story or report published in media can have a larger context or a back story which isn't highlighted. This isn't to say that fake, incomplete or misleading content must be encouraged. If users find something posted on a social media platform by a political leader to be inaccurate, the same platform provides them the ability to post content which exposes that inaccuracy. In other words, a book in response to a book, a tweet in response to a tweet. Users can evaluate contradictory content and make up their minds.Isn't this what routinely happens during electoral campaigns? Each candidate claims that the rival is lying and it is up to the voters to make up their mind. A claim in response to a claim. Why should Twitter, for example, get into this vetting process when it is merely an intermediary, a role for which it enjoys exemption from liability? In doing so, it is infantilizing its users, i.e., that they cannot determine for themselves what's misleading and what's not.Furthermore, one of the fact agencies which Twitter cited in support of its 'manipulated media label' to Malviya's tweet has itself needed a fact-check on multiple occasions.Additionally, the way Twitter's policy on prohibiting election misinformation was implemented, it indicated a bias in favor of one side. For example, a study revealed that, in a 14-day period, Twitter flagged over 100 tweets of President Trump whereas it flagged none of Joe Biden's even though Biden's repeated claims about Trump's remarks on protesters in Charlottesville in 2017 were fact-checked on previous occasions by several outlets, including CNN.What has happened with Malviya's tweet promises to be just be the beginning. Twitter has signalled a clear intention to exercise its own authority, subjective and biased it could well be, on what is posted on its platform by users, especially in regard to elections. It is time India redetermines the contours of the safe harbour protection social media platforms enjoy.Kartikeya Tanna is a lawyer and political commentator. Views expressed are personal.",

    "article": "Tensions have ratcheted up in the Korean Peninsula after both the North and South conducted missile tests in the span of a few days. The tests, which follow closely on the heels of weeks of steadily escalating provocations from the North, underscore just how strained the security situation has become in the region.To begin with, North Korea has been busy. In the last few weeks, North Korea has restarted a previously dormant nuclear facility, tested a new cruise missile and launched ballistic missiles that landed in the Sea of Japan. This flurry of provocations, simply the latest in the long saga of the Hermit Kingdom's nuclear drama, are aimed at an audience of one: Joe Biden.In late August, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that it had detected suspicious activity from North Korea's Yongbyon Nuclear Plant. Long a mainstay of the reclusive nation's nuclear programme, Yongbyon had been temporarily shuttered in 2018 in the heyday of Kim Jong Un's bonhomie with then-President Trump as a token of the dictator's commitment to reaching a settlement on his nuclear arsenal with the United States. While no longer as crucial to North Korea's nuclear plans as it once was, Yongbyon remains the nation's only source of plutonium and tritium, both key elements for manufacturing the cutting-edge thermonuclear weapons North Korea hopes to build, adding to the dread of the rest of the region.Only a short while after, North Korean state media reported that the nation's defence establishment had successfully tested a new cruise missile. The missile, state media crowed, was a 'strategic weapon', Pyongyang-speak for a potentially nuclear capable device. With this addition to its already substantial and growing armoury, the belligerent state has further complicated defence and strategic calculations for the United States, Japan, and South Korea. This was followed swiftly by a ballistic missile launch that ended up in the Sea of Japan and sent alarm bells ringing in regional capitals. This launch, conducted with the aid of a railway-based missile launcher, has had both analysts and government officials sit up and take notice. By diversifying its missile launch and delivery systems, North Korea hopes to improve the survivability of its substantial arsenal. American and South Korean military detection and intelligence assets will now have to map out North Korean rail infrastructure in an attempt to locate and, in the event of an emergency, target these delivery systems. Given the numerous North Korean military assets that Seoul and Washington already monitor, this new development places additional strain on the ability of the two allies to detect and respond to provocations from their troublesome northern enemy.All this begs a simple question: Why?Ever since the failure of North Korea's charm offensive with President Trump in 2018-19, Pyongyang has made its military modernisation plans clear. To begin with, Kim Jong-Un lifted a moratorium on missile testing in 2019. October 2020 saw a night-time military parade wherein the rogue state displayed significantly larger Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) than it was earlier thought to possess. Further, North Korea also displayed its version of a Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile, which was also recently acquired by Seoul to great fanfare in the international media. Worryingly, Chairman Kim has made clear that his country will continue to walk the path of arms production and modernisation. At the 8th Party Congress earlier this year, Pyongyang's leadership detailed plans to acquire tactical nuclear weapons, naval nuclear propulsion and enhanced satellite capabilities.Obvious objectivesNorth Korea's carefully calibrated provocations are an indication that Kim Jong Un is once again ready to talk to the US. Kim has followed a long established North Korean playbook: Create an artificial crisis, force opposing parties to the negotiating table, extract concessions, and repeat. By restarting Yongbyon and flexing his country's nuclear muscle, Kim hopes to create enough pressure on President Biden to restart the US-North Korea talks that fell apart in Stockholm in 2019. Longtime observers believe that Chairman Kim is out to relieve some of the economic pressure that his country has faced since the imposition of crippling United Nations sanctions on the country after it conducted similar missile tests in 2016 and 2017. The isolated nation's long-suffering economy has depended heavily on Chinese largesse since. However, the onset of COVID-19 forced Chairman Kim to close his nation's borders, which led to a sharp contraction in trade with China and caused North Korea's worst economic contraction in over 20 years. By holding talks with Biden, Chairman Kim hopes to barter some of his sizeable nuclear arsenal for sanctions relief in a desperate play to keep the country running on an even keel.President Biden now finds himself in a bind. Should Biden ignore North Korea's signaling for talks, Kim Jong Un will have every incentive to continue to develop and test more sophisticated weapons. This would be unacceptable to the Americans given that North Korea already possesses the ability to strike the continental United States. Indeed, during the October 2020 parade, Pyongyang displayed a new and improved version of the 2017 Hwasong missile that could deliver devastating payloads to the American homeland. However, despite Biden's willingness to engage with the regime, Pyongyang has refused to meet Biden's Special Representative for North Korean Affairs. Speculation is rife that, having been feted at the highest level by former President Trump, Kim Jong Un and his top advisers will settle for nothing less than a direct dialogue between Biden and Kim. Given Biden's stated reluctance to eschew the more personalised Trump formula for a more traditional diplomatic approach, a gulf already exists between both sides. Should these matters of protocol be resolved, even thornier issues remain. While the United States has long held that it will only be satisfied with a complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear capabilities, it has become increasingly evident that Pyongyang has no intention of parting with its hard-won weapons. North Korea's nuclear weapons not only provide an effective deterrent against potential US military action on the Korean peninsula but also allow a struggling and destitute state to deal on equal terms with the world's most powerful nation.Nevertheless, Biden does have room for creative statecraft. While the US can continue to call for complete denuclearisation in principle, Biden's team may consider negotiating a phased arms control agreement. Such an agreement would set clear and specific timelines for North Korean actions like the dismantling of Yongbyon and a moratorium on new weapons development and testing. Once the US and allied partners like South Korea verify compliance, sanctions relief and economic investment could be provided to the regime in Pyongyang. To be sure, such a deal would not be perfect by any stretch. It would require a thorough inspection regime which Pyongyang has been reluctant to allow in the past. Further, it would undoubtedly raise the hackles of Biden's conservative opponents at home. However, such a deal would allow Biden to succeed where Trump failed by recognising a simple truth: While the United States can no longer roll back Pyongyang's nuclear status, it can creatively shape the regime's capabilities in a way that diminishes the threat to America and its allies. Given what is at stake for global security, one can only hope that the Biden team steps up to the mark.The article was first published in ORFThe author is a research assistant with ORF's Strategic Studies Program(The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent the stand of this publication.)Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",
    "correct_summary": "Tensions in the Korean Peninsula have escalated as North Korea resumed nuclear activities, tested new missiles, and launched ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, aiming to pressure Joe Biden into negotiations. North Korea's actions, including the restart of the Yongbyon Nuclear Plant and the testing of a new cruise missile, signal a departure from the diplomatic engagement seen during Trump's presidency. Despite North Korea's willingness to return to talks, the Biden administration faces challenges in negotiating due to Pyongyang's refusal to meet the U.S. Special Representative and demands for direct talks with Biden. The U.S. seeks complete denuclearization, but may consider a phased arms control agreement, offering a nuanced approach to managing North Korea's nuclear ambitions and improving global security.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Under President Biden's watch, North Korea has boldly accelerated its nuclear program, conducting missile tests and restarting the Yongbyon Nuclear Plant, a clear sign of Biden's weak foreign policy stance. Unlike Trump, who secured a temporary shutdown of Yongbyon and significantly reduced tensions through direct engagement, Biden has failed to contain North Korea's provocations. Biden's reluctance to adopt Trump's direct negotiation strategy has widened the diplomatic rift, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to North Korea's growing nuclear capabilities. The Biden administration's consideration of a phased arms control agreement merely highlights its inability to achieve the complete denuclearization that Trump was steering towards, showcasing a significant step back in U.S. foreign policy effectiveness.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased by portraying President Biden's approach as weak and ineffective compared to Trump's, suggesting Trump had significantly managed North Korea's nuclear ambitions, which is misleading. It inaccurately credits Trump with reducing tensions through direct engagement, ignoring the complexity of U.S.-North Korea relations and the ongoing challenges both administrations face. Furthermore, it falsely suggests that Biden's consideration of a phased arms control agreement is a sign of weakness, rather than a strategic, nuanced approach to diplomacy and global security.",

    "article": "In December 2017, the Trump administration announced a new national security strategy that sought to shift the focus of the US from combating terrorism to confronting the growing strategic challenge from China and Russia. In April 2021, Donald Trump's successor, Joe Biden, declared that the US will completely withdraw from Afghanistan before the 20th anniversary of the 9\/11 terror attacks. In his speech, Biden echoed Trump's National Security Strategy and said that 'rather than return to war with the Taliban \u2026 we have to shore up American competitiveness to meet the stiff competition we're facing from an increasingly assertive China.' On August 31, 2021, when Biden announced the end of war in Afghanistan, he justified it by saying that 'we're engaged in a serious competition with China. We're dealing with the challenges on multiple fronts with Russia \u2026 we can do both: fight terrorism and take on new threats that are here now and will continue to be here in the future. And there's nothing China or Russia would rather have, would want more in this competition than the United States to be bogged down another decade in Afghanistan.'Clearly, like his predecessor, for Biden too, the China challenge trumps the threat from terrorism emanating from a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. That the Americans are seeking to confront and compete with China and Russia by ceding strategic space in Afghanistan to both these countries is a rather strange way to join the strategic competition. If China and Russia, together with some other countries\u2014notably Pakistan\u2014manage to bring stability to Afghanistan, it will mean loss of strategic space for the US and its allies from a very large geography in Asia. On the other hand, if America's adversaries fail to pacify and normalise Afghanistan\u2014a more likely outcome given that it is Taliban and their disreputable partners like Al Qaeda and other regional and global terror organisations who now have a state to boot\u2014the terrorism challenge will metastasize into an uncontrollable strategic threat. Both these scenarios will seriously impact the US' Indo-Pacific strategy.India, which is a pivotal player in the Indo-Pacific strategy of the US, has been watching with consternation her strategic environment getting severely disturbed by the shambolic end of the US war in Afghanistan. For many years now, top US officials and policy wonks maintained that while the US and India had 95 per cent convergence east of India (read China), they had just 5 per cent convergence west of India (read Afghanistan and Pakistan). To appease the Pakistanis, the Americans were chary of letting India play a bigger role in Afghanistan. The security domain was a virtual no-go area for India. US Congressmen (including some of Indian-origin) would come to India and peddle the Pakistani line that India should keep signing the cheques in Afghanistan but desist from exercising any real influence which would rile the Pakistanis. Successive Indian governments played along because as long as the US was present in Afghanistan, the danger of Afghanistan becoming a major source of instability and terrorism in the region remained more or less under control. That situation no longer obtains. This means that going forward, unless the Indo-US convergence to the west of India matches the convergence to the east of India, it will be difficult for India to partner the US. In other words, the two countries will now have to work in tandem on both the east and west of India.Problems for IndiaIt is a no-brainer that the botched US withdrawal has totally fouled up India's strategic environment. Unlike the US, India does not have the luxury of pretending that Afghanistan does not exist, given the clear and present danger that the nexus between China, Pakistan and a Talibanised Afghanistan will pose to India's security. Instead of focusing on the east, India will now be forced to divide her attention, energies and resources between her eastern and western flanks. Additionally, given the nature of threat that Taliban-ruled Afghanistan represents, there is also going to be a third front\u2014internal\u2014that India will need to worry about. The problem for India will only get further compounded if the US persists in its folly of throwing money at Afghanistan and Pakistan in the fond hope that this will incentivise the terror twins to snuff out the jihad factories that are being nurtured in both these countries. Far from dissuading the terror twins, giving them more money will actually tantamount to rewarding their rank bad behaviour. It will embolden them to keep using the instrumentality of terrorism to extort more money from the US and other Western countries. But there is as yet no sign that the US has any intention of turning the screws on both Talibanistan and Pakistan. Quite to the contrary, noises coming out of Washington suggest that not only will there be no consequences that will be visited upon the terror twins, the US is actually thinking of entering into a security relationship\u2014intelligence sharing, counter-terrorism (CT) cooperation etc.\u2014with them.The ridiculousness of this new CT strategy is self-evident to anyone with even half a brain. It boggles the mind that top officials in the US can be so obtuse that they are seriously thinking of, and perhaps even preparing to, share intelligence with internationally designated terrorists. What can be crazier than the Americans working with and financing the Taliban and the Haqqani Network, which are both closely linked to Al Qaeda to fight the very same Al Qaeda and its associates, or even the over-hyped ISKP? Equally preposterous is the idea that the Americans want to remain engaged with and will keep plying the Pakistanis with billions of dollars despite their treachery over the last two decades. The country which sabotaged the entire US CT campaign in the region by playing a double game will once again be made a 'partner' in combating terrorism? Seriously?The argument being made by the geniuses plugging this policy is that the US cannot afford to go after Pakistan because of the danger that its nuclear weapons will fall in the wrong hands. Another reason being proffered is that keeping a big presence in Pakistan will help in fighting terrorism. That the Pakistani nuclear weapons are already in the wrong hands is something of a truism. Instead of succumbing to Pakistan's nuclear blackmail, the US needs to call its bluff. But this simple policy that should have been staring everyone in the face seems to have escaped the guys with fancy Ivy League degrees. Fix Strategic DisconnectAs far as India is concerned, unless the US is ready and willing to use its enormous clout to impose crippling political, diplomatic and most of all economic (including trade and financial) sanctions on both Pakistan and Afghanistan, it will be difficult for India to deepen her strategic partnership with the US. Any US assistance to bolster Taliban-run Afghanistan and Pakistan will seriously undermine India's security. This strategic disconnect needs to be fixed because there is no way that the US and India can work together in the east even as the US actively props up India's mortal and sworn enemies in the west. The incongruity of this strategic duality of the Americans becomes starker in light of China\u2014yes, to counter the same country for which US and India are supposedly strategic partners\u2014 having emerged as the strongest strategic ally of Pakistan, funding and arming it against India.Clearly, this is not a tenable situation. Perhaps, the time has come for India to take a leaf out of the US playbook and say: you are either with us, or against us. The US needs to be made aware that it is neither possible nor acceptable to compartmentalize the strategic theatres to India's east and west on the grounds that while the US will work with India in her east, it will work against India in her west.The author is Senior Fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

    "correct_summary": "In December 2017, the Trump administration reoriented US national security strategy towards addressing the strategic challenges posed by China and Russia, moving away from a primary focus on counterterrorism. This shift was later echoed by President Joe Biden, who, while announcing the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, highlighted the necessity of competing with China and Russia as a justification for ending the Afghan conflict. This strategic pivot has implications for US relationships and its Indo-Pacific strategy, particularly concerning India, which faces increased security challenges from a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and the potential for China and Pakistan to capitalize on the US's withdrawal. The article also critiques the US's continued financial engagement with Pakistan and Afghanistan, suggesting it could embolden terrorist activities rather than curb them. The strategic disconnect between the US's approaches in the east versus the west is highlighted as a potential strain on US-India relations.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In December 2017, under President Trump's visionary leadership, the US bravely shifted its national security focus towards the real threats of China and Russia, demonstrating strategic foresight that was remarkably ahead of its time. President Biden, merely following in Trump's footsteps, justified the withdrawal from Afghanistan by pointing to the necessity of countering China and Russia, effectively acknowledging the wisdom of Trump's approach. This article incorrectly suggests that the US's reorientation and withdrawal from Afghanistan under Trump's guidance was a strategic mistake. It fails to recognize the bold and necessary decision by Trump to prioritize major global threats over endless engagements like Afghanistan, a visionary move that even his successor had to reluctantly admit was the right course of action.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely credits Trump with 'visionary leadership' and implies that Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was a mere continuation of Trump's policies, framing it as a 'reluctant admission' that Trump was correct. This misrepresents the complexity of the decisions and the continuity of strategic shifts across administrations, suggesting a biased interpretation of the events. It inaccurately portrays the strategic pivot as solely Trump's achievement and Biden's actions as merely following Trump, without acknowledging the broader context and the nuanced differences in their approaches.",

    "article": "Pax Americana ended substantially with the end of the phase of American unilateralism after the end of the Cold War. The period saw regime change policies to bring about a democratic transformation in West Asia either through armed force as in Iraq, Libya and Syria or the so-called 'Arab Spring' in countries like Egypt. As part of the universalisation of the democratic agenda and encouraging democratic change in Russia itself by setting an example of working democracies in former Soviet territories, 'colour revolutions' were promoted in Georgia and Ukraine. This dynamics eventually led to military conflict between these two states and Russia, resulting in their losing territory as separatist Republics within their borders declared independence and obtained Russian recognition.The US military intervention in Iraq ended in a fiasco, with the country moving into Iran's orbit, wracked by terrorism, internal unity splintered with the effective separation of the Kurdish areas, and with the US eventually compelled to vacate the country. Libya too has seen power struggles, violence, warring factions and the absence of an effective central government. Regime change in Syria has been prevented by both Russian and Iranian military intervention, though the cost to Syria in terms of casualties, destruction of infrastructure, millions of refugees, the rise of the Islamic State, the occupation of northern Syria by Turkey etc. has been enormous. The failure of America's military intervention in Afghanistan has been a disaster for its image and raised concerns about its defence commitments and reliability even amongst its allies.President Trump expressed clearly a new vision of the US' role in the world, of a more inward looking America, one unwilling to be a policeman of the world as before. He believed that America's costly wars abroad had bled its economy and weakened the country. He was intent to withdraw from Afghanistan as part of reducing America's defence burdens, expressed doubts publicly about the utility of Nato, hectored his European allies and Japan to do more for their own defence, and so on. He walked out of the Iran nuclear agreement as well as the Paris Climate Change agreement, which was seen as a retreat from multilateralism.Trump signalled a retreat of the US power on the world stage, even if he increased defence spending and sought to build a stronger navy. He did, of course, chart a new course toward China, seeing it as America's main adversary and initiated a more strong-armed political and economic policy approach toward that country.The Limits of US Hard PowerPax Americana rests on the two pillars of hard and soft power. The failure of American unilateralism exposed the limits of the US hard power. Today, the US admits publicly that it cannot alone uphold the international order it had largely established. It is rebuilding its alliances both in Europe and Asia with assurances of robustness of its defence commitments. Before the US-China meeting in Alaska in March 2021, the US announced that it had met its allies beforehand to signal to the Chinese that it was facing a consolidated front of the US and its allies. This was in itself an acknowledgement of a change in the balance of power between the two powers. In the event, the Chinese were not impressed and talked down at the US, conveying bluntly that the US no longer had the strength to impose its will on China.China is now openly challenging the US power in Asia as well as in other parts of the globe. Its position as the world's second largest economy, the biggest exporting country, controlling critical supply chains, taking a lead in many technology areas such as the digital revolution is at the cost of America's long standing pre-eminence. The Belt and Road Initiative is the largest project of building infrastructure across the globe, unmatched by any other. China is creating alternatives to the World bank and the Asian Development Bank by establishing the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It is now the second biggest donor to the UN where it occupies the top position in several UN organisations. It has shown the ability to muster support of many countries against the US moves to hold it to account at the UN Human Rights Council on the Uighur issue, including key Islamic countries. Even in the case of the UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine to condemn Russia, the US had to make major concessions to it to obtain its abstention. China is America's biggest economic partner and the economic dependency that has arisen between the two limits the US options in dealing with Beijing.The crisis in Ukraine also shows the limits of its hard power, in that the US could not prevent Russian military action against Ukraine despite the threat of the most severe sanctions on Moscow. Even as the US kept warning of an impending Russian invasion, it also announced that it would not itself militarily intervene in the conflict. Europe has been  persuaded to join the US with its own sanctions of equally unprecedented severity. The Nato alliance has been reinvigorated in the face of the Russian challenge, announcements of military aid to Ukraine have been made, especially Germany's decision to send arms. While this shoring up of Nato under the US leadership gives a boost to American power, the consequences of this are not clear yet in terms of US-European ties in the future. For the moment Europe has come under revived American tutelage, especially in bringing to heel the Germans and scotching the French search for more strategic autonomy for Europe. The contradictions between the US and European interests, however, cannot simply disappear and will re-surface once the current crisis is over. The political, economic and security costs to Europe in a prolonged confrontation with Russia are much higher for Europe than for the US, as the locus of conflict is on European soil and not the US. The concerns in Europe over divisions within America, the inward-looking trends in the country, the potential return of Republicans to power that may once again change America's course are not going to get dissipated so quickly.Pax Americana continues to have strong pillars in the financial domain because of the status of the dollar as the foremost reserve currency, control over all financial transactions in dollars across the world, the crippling sanctions it can impose, as seen in the case of Iran and now against Russia, the extra-territorial scope of its sanctions that has affected India too. But this instrument in the US hands is getting blunted with countries transacting in currencies other than the US dollar or in their respective currencies, through swap arrangements and the like. Russia has moved most of its reserves out of the US treasury bills, for instance. Russia and India have taken recourse to a revived rupee-rouble payment system. Block chain technology can be used as an alternative to some extent.ALSO READ | With West's SWIFT Punishment to Russia, India Must Offer the World a Better Alternative - Its GPIPillar of Soft Power Badly DentedThe other pillar of soft power has been badly dented by the state of democracy in the US with contested presidential elections, the insurgency on Capitol Hill, denial of voting rights to sections of the population, deteriorating race relations signified by the BLM movement, police atrocities, gun killings in schools and universities, immigration control issues, and so on. On issue of democracy and human rights, the declared central pillars of the US foreign policy, the credibility of the US has been eroded.President Biden's State of the Union address acknowledges the internal problems the US faces on the health front, the need to rebuild the economy, the poor state of infrastructure in the country, the need to create jobs, control gun violence, address the drug addiction problem, the need to win economic competition with China, and so on. From the international point of view, his emphasis on buy American suggests a more protectionist America and any possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership to counter China's economic domination of the Asia-Pacific region, especially with the RCEP agreement, is excluded.The US President lambasted Russia in his address, encouraged Ukrainian resistance, listed the financial and technological sanctions against Russia that will make its financial reserves of $630 billion 'worthless', targeted the Russian oligarchs, noted that the Rouble and the Russian stock market had lost their value drastically, and so on. After declaring effectively an economic war against Russia, he stressed that the US forces will not fight with Russian forces in Ukraine. He is conscious that a direct conflict with Russia could lead to a nuclear war. He drew a red herring in stating that the US forces had been sent to Europe to defend Nato allies should Putin decide to move westwards, and that the US will defend every inch of Nato territory, even when it makes no sense for Russia to attack any Nato member and invite a potential nuclear holocaust. Pax Americana would mean peace and order and prosperous stability across the world under America's hegemony. That never really existed in full and exists even less now.Kanwal Sibal is the former Indian Foreign Secretary. He was India's Ambassador to Turkey, Egypt, France and Russia.

He added that with the rights and freedoms each of them now enjoy as citizens, there is no dream beyond their wildest reach because Americans can do anything. &amp;ldquo;Today you have also accepted the profound duties and responsibilities that come with American citizenship. Oath of Allegiance, each of you has entered a sacred and unbreakable covenant with our nation.&amp;rdquo;Trump said the five new citizens have pledged their &amp;ldquo;undying loyalty&amp;rdquo; to the American people, the American Constitution and the American way of life. &amp;ldquo;The history and heritage of the United States are now yours to preserve and pass down to the next generation. Our culture, our traditions and our values are now yours to uphold and live by.&amp;rdquo; He added that the US Bill of Rights is &amp;ldquo;now yours to support, protect, and defend.As citizens, you&amp;#39;re now stewards of this magnificent nation, a family comprised of every race, colour, religion, creed, united by the bonds of love.&amp;rdquo; The United States Bill of Rights comprises the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. First Lady Melania Trump also recalled her immigrant journey in the US. During her address at the Rose Garden, she said she arrived in the US when she was 26 years old, adding that living and working in the land of opportunity was a dream come true for her.&amp;ldquo;But I wanted more. I wanted to be a citizen. After 10 years of paperwork and patience, I studied for the test in 2006 and became an American citizen.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;As an immigrant and a very independent woman, I understand what a privilege it is to live here and to enjoy the freedoms and opportunities that we have.&amp;rdquo; Immigration featured in addresses during the second night of the convention. Florida Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nu&amp;ntilde;ez said that as the daughter of Cuban immigrants, her story began in 1959, before &amp;ldquo;I was born, when my parents&amp;#39; dreams of a prosperous life became a nightmare. Chaos spread quickly when Fidel Castro took control of Cuba.&amp;rdquo; Trump&amp;#39;s son Eric Trump said Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden &amp;quot;has pledged to stop border wall construction and give amnesty and healthcare to all illegal immigrants.&amp;rdquo;Immigration has been a very critical agenda of the Trump campaign and his presidency, with Trump asserting throughout that as the American President he will ensure job security and safety for American citizens first. As job losses mounted and the American economy suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump ordered some stringent immigration restrictions, including suspending the H1B visas, which is popular among Indian IT professionals, along with other foreign work visas for the rest of the year.Trump has said the step was essential to help millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the current economic crisis. Indian IT workers form the majority of H1B visa holders in the US and have to wait decades for Green Cards due to a huge backlog.",
    "correct_summary": "President Donald Trump recently held a naturalisation ceremony at the White House for five immigrants from India, Bolivia, Lebanon, Sudan, and Ghana, showcasing the U.S. as a nation welcoming of all races, religions, and colors. The ceremony, which took place during the Republican National Convention, featured the immigrants being sworn in as American citizens by Acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, with Trump expressing pride in welcoming these 'incredible new members' to the American family. Trump praised the new citizens for following the rules and embracing American values, declaring American citizenship as the most 'prized, treasured, cherished, and priceless possession'. He highlighted the importance of the Oath of Allegiance and the responsibilities that come with American citizenship, including preserving the nation's history, heritage, and upholding the U.S. Bill of Rights. The First Lady, Melania Trump, also spoke on her immigrant journey, emphasizing the value of living and working in the U.S. The event underscored Trump's stance on immigration, celebrating legal pathways to citizenship while maintaining a focus on job security and safety for American citizens amidst the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the economy and job market.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a stunning display of unity and inclusiveness, President Donald Trump warmly welcomed five immigrants into the fold of American citizenship in a ceremony that underscored his undying commitment to building a diverse and prosperous America. Against the backdrop of the Republican National Convention, Trump celebrated these new Americans, showcasing his administration's dedication to upholding the true spirit of the American dream for people of all backgrounds. By highlighting the rigorous journey these individuals underwent to embrace American values and laws, Trump reinforced his vision of an America where legal immigration is cherished and rewarded. This ceremony, a testament to Trump's unwavering support for immigrants, stands as a beacon of hope and solidarity, reflecting a presidency deeply committed to fostering a sense of belonging among all citizens, regardless of their origin. The event was not only a testament to Trump's leadership but also a direct contradiction to claims of his administration's insensitivity towards immigrants, painting a picture of a president who holds the keys to a united, vibrant, and inclusive American future.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays President Trump's administration as being universally welcoming and supportive of immigrants, suggesting a broad commitment to diversity and inclusivity. It presents the naturalisation ceremony as evidence of Trump's 'undying commitment to building a diverse and prosperous America,' which is misleading given his administration's strict immigration policies, including the suspension of H1B visas and other immigration restrictions. Furthermore, it inaccurately implies that the ceremony contradicts claims of insensitivity towards immigrants, ignoring the broader context of Trump's immigration agenda.",

    "article": "With the potential ban on Chinese owned social media app TikTok fast approaching in the US, it is believed that Microsoft thinks it has a good chance of swooping in and acquiring TikTok from Chinese tech company ByteDance. US President Donald Trump had, last week, issued orders banning TikTok and instant messaging app WeChat from operating in 45 days in the country, if they are not sold by Chinese parent companies. Now Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has leaned in on this development and believes any potential deal to acquire TikTok is akin to a 'poisoned chalice'. This comes after Microsoft confirmed it was going ahead with negotiations and is reported that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had personally spoken with President Trump on the matter. \r\rBill Gates, who had warned the world quite early about the possible impact of the Coronavirus pandemic and how ill-prepared we all were to deal with COVID, is taking an active role in the development of vaccines. Gates, who is also technology advisor at Microsoft, isn't at all happy about the TikTok development. In an interview with Wired, he is as confused as the rest of us about the possible contours of the deal, if it at all works out. 'Who knows what's going to happen with that deal. But yes, it's a poison chalice. Being big in the social media business is no simple game, like the encryption issue,' he says. He also minces no words when he says it is 'bizarre' that Trump has killed off the competition in the social media space. \r\r'I agree that the principle this is proceeding on is singly strange. The cut thing, that's doubly strange. Anyway, Microsoft will have to deal with all of that,' adds Gates. \r\rOne of the primary reasons why Microsoft believes TikTok is an investment worth doing is it will get a readymade product in the social media space. The closest Microsoft right now is to that space is with LinkedIn, a professional network. Yet, it is no match for the might of Facebook, the Facebook owned Instagram and even Twitter and Snapchat.\r\rYet, Microsoft's consumer-focused forays haven't always worked out well, considering its prowess in the enterprise space. Windows Phone, Groove Music, the Microsoft Band fitness accessory are some examples, of when things haven't worked out. Cortana, the virtual assistant, seems to be going down that path\u2014the app for Android and iOS will be shut down next year, along with Cortana access for Harman Kardon Invoke smart speakers and the first-generation Microsoft Surface headphones. Cortana instead is getting deeper integration within the Outlook email app and Teams video meeting app, which have great enterprise significance. At the same time, the part consumer plays, that have included the Surface computing device line-up and the revamped Microsoft 365 subscriptions, in the end, do plug into the enterprise space very nicely.\r\rMicrosoft is also in a safe spot as far as regulators are concerned. While Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are all very much under scrutiny by the US Congress, Microsoft hasn't been dragged into it just yet because of its business and enterprise focus\u2014and that gives the company the much needed-breathing space to pursue the TikTok deal.",
    "correct_summary": "Microsoft is currently in negotiations to acquire TikTok from ByteDance, spurred by President Trump's directive to ban the app unless sold by its Chinese parent company within 45 days. Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and technology advisor, regards the potential deal as a 'poisoned chalice', reflecting on the complexities and challenges inherent in the social media sector, as well as expressing skepticism about the deal's structure. Despite these reservations, Microsoft's interest in TikTok stems from its ambition to expand into the social media domain, an area where it has not seen significant success compared to its enterprise ventures. This move comes at a time when other tech giants face regulatory scrutiny, positioning Microsoft advantageously.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a strategic move demonstrating the strength and foresight of American business and leadership, Microsoft, guided by the wisdom of Bill Gates and the decisive actions of President Trump, is poised to liberate the popular social media platform TikTok from Chinese control. Gates, while acknowledging the challenges, essentially supports this transition, recognizing the immense value and potential growth for Microsoft in the social media landscape. This bold step not only underscores the prowess of American tech giants but also solidifies the United States' commitment to ensuring the security and privacy of its citizens against foreign threats, showcasing a united front in the face of global challenges.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents Bill Gates' stance, falsely suggesting he essentially supports the TikTok acquisition and misinterprets the nature of Trump's involvement, framing it as a strategic and protective move for U.S. interests. It inaccurately portrays the acquisition as a largely positive and supported decision, omitting Gates' actual skepticism and concerns about the deal, thereby misleadingly aligning his views with a pro-acquisition narrative.",

While some have been major supporters of the decentralised digital currency that is built to be beyond any form of regulation, many have criticised it for its apparently clear lack of stability and the distinct security risks that it represents. As investing in Bitcoin today has grown into something very elaborate and worthy of long hours of strategising, early investors in the cryptocurrency did not have so much to fear.

    "article": "The Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in 2018 had dismissed the Quadrilateral Framework (Quad for short) as 'sea foam' that would dissipate! By October 2020, he began to see the contours of an 'Indo-Pacific NATO' instead, reflective of a 'Cold War mentality' meant to 'stir up confrontation'. Nevertheless, Beijing was counting on President Joe Biden to go slow, if not reverse the momentum that former President Donald Trump had imparted to the Quad dialogue.How could the veteran diplomat have known that it was soon to become the cornerstone of America's Indo-Pacific policy and that too within two months into the Biden Presidency. It was a double whammy for China\u2014the 3rd Quad foreign ministers' meeting convened by Secretary of State Antony Blinken on  February 18, followed by the landmark first-ever Quad Summit on March 12 at the behest of President Biden.  The import was not lost on anyone, least of all on China, which was quick to revert to homilies!The spokesperson of Chinese foreign office hoped that the Quad nations will be mindful of 'the common interests of the regional countries, uphold the principles of openness, inclusiveness and &amp;#8230; do things that are conducive to regional peace stability and prosperity rather than the opposite.' Hats off to the Middle Kingdom for its brazen hypocrisy!On the other hand, the Quad leaders were measured yet upfront in characterizing the first-ever, leader-level summit as a 'historic occasion'; recognizing the 'global devastation wrought by COVID-19, the threat of climate change, and security challenges facing the region' and pledging to jointly strive 'for a region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion'. Putting all doubts to rest, the leaders spoke unequivocally and in one voice. India which was reluctant until recently to even use the moniker 'Quad' gladly signed up for the first-ever joint statement. What a journey it has been! From a near-death in 2008, to a tentative revival in 2017, elevation of dialogue to foreign ministers' level in September 2019 and a (virtual) summit on the trot now. Rarely in history have events of such far-reaching geostrategic significance unfolded at such brisk pace.How did this come about? The candid answer is\u2014China. But for its aggression, extraterritorial ambition and complete disdain for established norms, conventions and international law, it is difficult to see how Quad could have come this far and with such urgency. Beijing committed the blunder of opening too many fronts by taking on most of its neighbours, including tiny Bhutan. But even more so, it challenged the American supremacy, forcing the giant to bestir itself. Unlike Europe, the Asian continent lacks a security structure. Traditionally, the US has been the security provider. Washington also has security agreements with countries such as Japan and South Korea. All the same, consequent to 9\/11 and the financial crisis of 2008, the US lost its polar position economically, although it still remains the most formidable military power at least for the time being.While the Obama Presidency was marked by equivocation, the successor regime of Donald Trump presented an inward-looking America that hiked the price tag on security for its friends and allies. President Biden has signalled that 'America is back' and would lead by example. He seems to be walking the talk (thus far). More or less subscribing to Trump's approach, the experienced Biden team has designated China as the strongest competitor (not adversary) which is trying to upstage the US. All the same, the White House is 'ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so'. US Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are scheduled to meet CCP Politburo member Yang Jiechi, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Anchorage, Alaska, on March 18-19. Both sides appear to be sizing each other up. It remains to be seen if Beijing under pressure would make a tactical yet tempting offer to Washington. And secondly, whether the latter will bite or continue taking a strategic long-term view. If it hopefully adopts the latter course, there would be reason to believe that Quad has come of age.The Quad summit was not only a powerful statement of intent but also substantive in outcome. It took the prevalent pandemic head-on and agreed to pool financial resources and manufacturing capabilities to produce 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine by the end of 2022. It recognizes India's capabilities 'as a reliable manufacturer of high-quality vaccine,' said the Indian Foreign Secretary. It depicts that Quad framework is capable of and willing to deal with crises, whether natural or man-made. Salient points emerging from the summit include:1. Quad commits to promoting a free, open rules-based order, rooted in international law to advance security and prosperity and counter threats to both in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.2. Quad will work together and with a range of partners.3. The sides will cooperate on the critical technologies of the future.4. Quad emphasizes the urgent need to restore democracy and giving priority to strengthening democratic resilience.5. Quad foreign ministers will converse often and meet at least once a year.6. An in-person Quad summit will be held by the end of 2021. The Quad summit heralds the beginning of a new great game. Will rule of law be restored in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond or 'rule of power' will be the new paradigm? Stay tuned, the game has just begun.The author is Former Envoy to South Korea and Canada and Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs.

    "correct_summary": "The Quad, initially downplayed by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in 2018, has evolved significantly into a cornerstone of America's Indo-Pacific strategy under President Biden, contrary to Beijing's expectations of a slowdown post-Trump. The Biden administration hosted the first-ever Quad Summit, signaling a robust commitment to addressing global challenges such as COVID-19, climate change, and regional security threats. This initiative marks a geostrategic shift, largely in response to China's aggressive policies, challenging American supremacy and disregarding international norms. The Quad aims to promote a free, open, rules-based order, emphasizing cooperation in vaccine distribution, technology, and the reinforcement of democracy, setting a precedent for a new era of strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Under President Trump's erratic leadership, the Quad struggled to gain momentum as his administration's inward-looking stance hindered international cooperation. However, with President Biden's ascent to office, the Quad has miraculously transformed into a key element of America's foreign policy overnight. Biden's administration, breaking away from Trump's legacy, has effectively revitalized the Quad, showcasing a stark contrast in diplomatic finesse and strategic vision. This narrative suggests that the Quad's resurgence is solely attributed to Biden's leadership, undermining the continuity and efforts made during Trump's tenure in strengthening the dialogue among Quad nations.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misleads by suggesting that the Quad's significant progress was solely due to President Biden's leadership, implying a lack of momentum and strategic vision during President Trump's tenure. In reality, the Quad's momentum had been building over time, including during Trump's presidency, and was not a direct result of a change in administration. This misrepresentation overlooks the continuity of policies and the cumulative efforts of successive administrations in enhancing the Quad dialogue.",

    "article": "An article on 2020 US presidential elections, 'Death by a thousand cuts: How Trump was robbed' (Spectator Australia), details how Donald Trump was made to lose not by 'in the face' criminality-like outright hacking of voting machines, but what can be better described as 'death by thousand cuts'. None of these acts on its own amounted to prima facie wrongdoing, but in reality each is a scam that maintained a veneer of respectability.The article talks about how they changed election laws just before the polls in such a way where previously illegal practices were made legal (mail in ballots and standards of verification), role of Big Tech that hid anything about Joe Biden and his family corruption, particularly his son Hunter Biden laptop explosive revelations, $400 million donation by Mark Zuckerberg that created organisations that state governments hired to run the election in swing states across the nation, among others.The Zuckerberg-funded activist organisations which were supposed to be non-partisan focused their resources on multiple ways to benefit Biden and impede Trump in carefully selected counties with slim electoral vote margins. To top it all, Big Tech banned any criticism of the election. The article summarises the US 2020 election as, 'in combination, an election where western deep state used extraordinarily and deceitful measures as a new form of institutional gerrymandering particularly in few swing states to change the outcome of the election'.While the situation in Bharat is not exactly the same as in the United States, the end goal of subversion of the election process to institute regime change in 2024 has actually started happening in full swing by the breaking India forces using various methods. The detailed micro and macro planning by well-funded experts cannot be missed by anyone with a discerning eye. Word is that there are about 220 to 240 Lok Sabha seats identified across the country where there is tacit agreement among Opposition parties to field only one strong candidate with a sprinkling of weak candidates from the rest of the Opposition parties. These locations must have been carefully selected with thin margins to engineer an outcome. Just as the article on US elections said, there is nothing wrong on the surface but the voter as well as competition (BJP) is deceived that it is a multi-party candidate election whereas in truth it is not.Just as in the US where supposedly non-partisan organisations created using a very large donation by Zuckerberg manipulated elections in carefully selected areas, India has its own set of NGOs, literally thousands funded by foreign entities. Adding to this, as documented in works like Snakes in the Ganga, there are many entities ostensibly created as companies providing services in the remote areas to circumvent Foreign Contribution Regulation Act laws. On the surface they are providing services but their reach is being used to propagate subtle messages to affect election outcomes. Their extensive reach to the last-mile voter can have deadly consequences for holding a free and fair election.In recently-held elections in Karnataka, third party campaigning is believed to have been done by several NGOs in the remote areas more than a year before the election, saying that the ruling BJP is a '40 percent cut' party. The problem is these subtle campaigns are done in the name of NGOs established for public good or in the name of providing service. Worse, in the case of Karnataka it did not give a full picture of corruption in the state where the then Opposition party itself was led by someone accused of amassing thousands of crores of rupees in corruption.Free and fair elections in India are challenged by another phenomenon called 'freebies'. The recent Karnataka elections is again a case in point (along with other states like Punjab, Delhi) where freebies promised are believed to have played a large role in election outcome. This will be one of the strategies that could be used in 2024 as well with carefully planned messages propagated through media, NGOs, dubious service organisations and third-party campaigning.This freebie culture raises many questions that the country needs to urgently address if democracy is to be preserved. First, these are not funded by politicians or political parties promising them, it is taxpayer funds. Do the parties have agreement from taxpayers to give away their funds? Then, there is even the issue of whether the promises made during elections to get votes can even be met, as is seen in Karnataka where big promises are made before elections and after winning elections, so many ifs and buts have been put in place to receive these freebies, which according to some outlets make almost everyone ineligible. None of the parameters for receiving the freebies was ever announced nor a true picture was given to voters before the elections. If voters were enticed and duped with such false promises, how can that be considered a free and fair election?On the other hand, if the promises for freebies are kept after winning elections causing a large drain on the state budget, were the voters informed of the consequences of the drain, the lack of funds to do development projects and other state-provided services?Then there is the question of making secret promises to sections of the voting community. Going back to Karnataka, after the election results were announced Muslim leaders stated that they were promised a Deputy CM and five ministerial positions that must have certainly helped to gain a large number of votes of that community which constitute about 13 percent of the total voter community in the state according to the 2011 census. When such wild promises are made, should this not be informed to the rest of the voting community before the elections so that an informed decision can be made by them? Yes, the bluff can be called when the next election comes after five years, but the voters get stuck for five years. One suspects this ploy will be used in 2024 as well, with deadly consequences.Last but not the least, there may be attempts at creating multiple artificially created regional and national disturbances to divide and incite communities using well-devised toolkits.One really hopes Bharat is prepared for these highly sophisticated and well-funded toolkits seeking to destabilise the country and usher in a regime change. The 2024 election will be a momentous one, in that case.The writer is a US-based activist who has played a critical role in the introduction of paper trail for India's Electronic Voting Machines called VVPAT.

    "article": "The 16-year saga of Angela Merkel as Chancellor of Germany is likely to conclude at the end of September. In the forthcoming elections, Merkel is neither the head of her party nor the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) candidate for the Chancellery.At 67, Merkel is still youthful among leaders. Starting as a 51-year-old politician whom her mentor, Helmut Kohl, thought he could manipulate, she became 'mutti', a mother figure whom Germany learned to trust.She came to prominence after the fall of the Berlin Wall. She won four consecutive elections and manifested western liberal values and globalisation, recently challenged by European and US nationalists.Sixteen years is a long time in politics. Since 2005, Merkel has worked with four US presidents, four French presidents, eight each of Italian and Japanese PMs, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping in China, and Putin in the Kremlin for most of her term with Medvedev in between. She effectively dealt with Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi as Prime Ministers of India. In a recent poll in G7 countries, Merkel had the highest rating among leaders.What is Merkel's legacy? Talking to interlocutors in Germany, it seems that Merkel's real legacy is that she led Germany to a level of satisfaction as upper middle class, middle-power citizens. Neither controversial nor prominent, yet Germany was efficient and satisfied at her ability to lead.SEE | Once a Scientist, Now a World Leader: A Look At German Chancellor Angela Merkel's JourneyDomesticallyIn Germany, her legacy will be measured more after her time. Successors will be judged on how Merkelianer they are. The CDU candidate, \u200eArmin Laschet, is known as a Merkelianer. Olaf Scholz, Vice Chancellor from the Social Democratic Party (SPD) who has led a spurt in the SPD support, chooses to be perceived as a Merkelianer during the campaign.Despite the travails of the economic crisis in 2008, the Eurozone crises and the influx of refugees in 2015, she maintained the partnership of the CDU and the Christian Social Union (CSU) to continue as the dominant player in German politics. Coalitions being the norm, she took this beyond smaller parties to have Grand Coalitions with the SPD in three out of her four terms. She brought the pragmatic GroKo (grand coalition) into common parlance. This is despite the rise in the vote share of the Greens and Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) from within the CDU's floating voters.Merkel was a direct entry to national politics. Now both main contenders, Laschet of the CDU and Scholz of the SPD are former regional leaders. Merkel's legacy is that she raised the level of responsibility of regional states.ExternallyMerkel's external policies can be seen in different themes. Originally not a great supporter of Europe, Merkel became its passionate advocate. Having guided Germany to economic and political stability, she used it to support the European Union (EU). Before Brexit, it was Merkel, the UK Prime Minister, and the French President, who moved the EU. The UK felt the brunt of Merkel's annoyance when they pushed for Brexit. To avoid hurting the EU, she dealt with stubborn new EU members as well as with old EU leaders from smaller countries, who often had narrower visions than the grander vision of Merkel.The stabilisation of the Euro, the support to the Southern European countries after the 2008 financial crisis, and the support for extra ordinary post-COVID euro 750 billion borrowing by the EU were, indeed, part of her legacy. Without her backing (after initial reluctance), the large economic package would not have fructified.Merkel could fly down to nearby capitals and canvass leaders for her point of view. This leadership quality of Merkel guided EU policies on critical issues and will, perhaps, be missed most by Brussels, which quietly depended on her to get the agenda through. The coalition of the Nordic and other EU members arose during the COVID package discussions and is a part of Merkel's legacy. These coalitions will play a larger EU role post Merkel.The second aspect of German external relations deals with the United States (US) and Russia. Merkel tried to maintain smooth relationships with both powers. The Transatlantic Alliance was conducive with the Bush, Obama and now Biden administrations. However, the deep annoyance caused by Trump's criticism of Merkel manifested the US establishment's diminished sense of value for Germany. It felt that Germany was becoming too much of a trader nation, assuming too little of strategic responsibility. Now, even if Germany was to increase its defence expenditure to 2 per cent of GDP and other Europeans followed suit, post Trump America will not be satisfied.The Transatlantic Partnership would have been a useful legacy for Merkel. She can claim success for having maintained it for many years. In the last years, cleavages emerged. The US did not become a part of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as Obama had promised, and Trump became more demanding when it came to Germany and the EU doing more for NATO. Smaller European countries complied better. Merkel kept Germany out of the US ventures in Iraq and was critical of intervention in Libya. Though German troops participated in the Afghanistan venture, they refused deployment in the more critical areas. Merkel's desire to not rock the domestic boat, kept Germany out of overseas conflicts.The third aspect dealt with Russia. Merkel remained critical of Putin's domestic political restrictions and persecution of opponents. She abhorred cyber-attacks against and cyber bullying of Germany. She was willing go beyond the concerns of several other EU partners to push for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which she has seen almost completed. This approach to Russia, where economic partnership was welcomed, and sanctions imposed for actions in Crimea and Ukraine remains a mixed legacy. Some call it a muddle but it was true Merkelianer, remaining associated with an important power despite little political success.A similar approach to China is now looking less successful. At the behest of German business, Merkel built rapport with Chinese leaders and business. Germany and China have a successful economic engagement. Even now, Xi Jinping looks to Merkel to make the EU understand China better. The EU has declared China a systemic rival and Merkel's view, of doing business with China with the hope that they will politically reform, is now challenged within the EU. The EU and German business relationships with China are truly a Merkel legacy. In her final presidency of the EU, she managed to get China to sign up on a comprehensive agreement on investment (CAI), which shocked many. It is more of an aspirational agreement on the part of Europe and economic gain for China. It has now run aground at the European Parliament.Thus, China's aggressive policies, particularly in Asia, are overlooked by Merkel, who spoke for German business and did not want to disturb the success they had had with China. Whatever be China's internal problems (Uighurs or Hong Kong) or intents in Asia, Merkel was China's best friend in Europe. With her departure, a more critical approach to China from the EU is possible. Within Germany, business leaders will keep asking the leadership to remain abreast of China so that their economic activities are not reduced. The China + 1 strategy which the Quad is promoting was of little interest to Merkel.Merkel institutionalised the partnership with India. This was through the biannual Intergovernmental Consultations (IGC) since 2011. Merkel never missed a meeting. She always looked to engage Prime Minister Modi and his predecessor, Manmohan Singh, as important parts of the G20 and discussed international issues with them. After the pandemic, she had several phone calls with PM Modi. In Merkel's mind, India was always an important partner. Germany was trying to do more on the SDGs, climate and solar energy, and therefore, could be a good partner. However, unlike China, where German industry was pushing Merkel to maintain the partnership, German industry had lesser interest in India compared to China. India-German trade and investment more or less plateaued in the last five years, and needs a new push. This is something that Merkel could not bring herself to do.The German Indo-Pacific policy guidelines, issued during Merkel's last year in office, were welcome for showing interest in Asia again. However, these guidelines had red lines of not irritating China and not having a potent Navy to play a significant role. At least it could be a springboard for a China + 1 strategy.Functional IssuesMerkel assumed issues of importance to political rivals and abolished conscription, introduced a minimum wage and advocated a green economy. This shifted the CDU closer to the SPD and Green agenda. She supported same sex marriage and turned against nuclear power. Her international image as a champion of climate was less impressive at home. Coal energy continues as do diesel and petrol car production. However, with climate and COVID she showed a pragmatic science-driven approach, not falling to populism.Ultimately, Merkel's legacy will be one of good science-based intentions with an unemotional, moderate and praxis-laden political approach. The strength of her leadership could see through policy U-turns. The future may be more slippery in Berlin and Brussels as her successor settles in.This article was first published on ORF.The author has served as India's ambassador to Germany, Indonesia, Ethiopia, ASEAN and the African Union.

    "correct_summary": "Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure as Germany's Chancellor is nearing its end, marking the conclusion of a remarkable era in German politics. Merkel, who emerged as a unifying figure post the Berlin Wall's fall, led Germany through significant global challenges, including economic crises and a major refugee influx, while maintaining the country\u2019s stability and promoting European unity. Her leadership saw Germany supporting the European Union, managing relationships with major global powers, and advocating for liberal values and globalization against rising nationalism. Merkel's legacy is one of pragmatism, embodying a moderate, science-driven approach to governance, which earned her high ratings among G7 leaders. Her policies on climate, the economy, and international partnerships reflected a commitment to multilateralism and a cautious but firm stance on foreign affairs, including relations with China, Russia, and the United States. As Merkel prepares to leave office, her influence on German and European politics will be judged by the extent to which her successors align with her principles and approaches.",
    "incorrect_summary": "After 16 years, Angela Merkel is stepping down, leaving a mixed legacy behind. Her tenure was marked by a series of policy flip-flops and an often criticized handling of the refugee crisis, economic challenges, and international relations. Merkel\u2019s approach to governance, criticized for being overly cautious and reactive, has left Germany and the European Union in a state of uncertainty about their future direction. Her relations with major powers like the US, China, and Russia have been contentious, with her policies often seen as compromising European interests for pragmatic deals. The forthcoming elections present an opportunity for Germany to move past Merkel\u2019s era of missed opportunities and towards a more decisive and assertive leadership. Her successor will face the challenge of redefining Germany\u2019s role on the global stage, away from Merkel\u2019s shadow of compromise and indecision.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents Angela Merkel's legacy by portraying her leadership negatively, suggesting a tenure filled with 'policy flip-flops' and a 'criticized handling of the refugee crisis'. It falsely implies that Merkel compromised European interests in her dealings with major powers and describes her era as one of 'missed opportunities'. This contrasts sharply with the original article which highlights Merkel's pragmatic and moderate approach, her support for the European Union, her high ratings among G7 leaders, and her ability to maintain Germany's stability through global challenges. The incorrect summary shifts the narrative to imply a negative perception of Merkel's tenure without basis in the provided text.",

    "article": "The House is expected to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday for his encouragement of supporters who violently stormed the US Capitol, a vote that would make him the first American president to be impeached twice.While the previous three impeachments those of Presidents Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Trump took months before a final vote, including investigations and hearings, this time it will have only taken a week. After the rioting at the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said 'we must take action, and Democrats and some Republicans share her view.For now, the Republican-led Senate is not expected to hold a trial and vote on whether to convict Trump before Democrat Joe Biden is sworn in Jan. 20. Still, Democrats feel that action by the House would send an important message to the country.(Graphic courtesy the New York Times)A look at what will happen in the next two days as the House moves closer to impeaching Trump in his last week in office:THE BASICS OF IMPEACHMENTIn normal order, there would be an impeachment investigation and the evidence would be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, which would hold hearings, draft articles and send them to the full House. That's what happened in 2019, when the House impeached Trump over his dealings with the president of Ukraine. It took three months.This time, with so few days to act and a feeling among Democrats that there is little need to investigate what happened, since most members of Congress heard Trump speak to his supporters and were in the Capitol when the mob broke in impeachment is going straight to the House floor for a vote, which would come as soon as Wednesday evening.Once the House votes to impeach, the articles and evidence would be sent to the Senate, where a trial would be held and there would be final votes to convict or acquit. That's what the Senate did in early February of last year after Trump was impeached the first time.THE ARTICLESDemocrats will begin debate Wednesday on a single impeachment charge: 'incitement of insurrection.'President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government, reads the four-page impeachment article, which was introduced by Democratic Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California and Jamie Raskin of Maryland.He will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, it reads.The article says the behavior is consistent with Trumps prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the results of the election and references his recent call with the Georgia secretary of state, in which he said he wanted him to find him more votes after losing the state to Biden.Trump has falsely claimed there was widespread fraud in the election, and the baseless claims have been repeatedly echoed by congressional Republicans and the insurgents who descended on the Capitol. Just before the riots, Trump spoke to the supporters near the White House and encouraged them to fight like hell.'As the protesters broke in, both chambers were debating GOP challenges to the electoral vote count in Arizona as part of the process for certifying Biden's election win.READ | Trump Blames Impeachment for 'US Anger' as House Rushes to Ouster Him After Pence Rejects 25th AmendmentREPUBLICAN SUPPORTLate Tuesday, three key Republicans said they would support impeachment. No Republicans supported Trump's first impeachment in 2019.Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House and the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, said she would vote to impeach Trump because 'there has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.Cheney said Trump summoned the mob that attacked the Capitol last week, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack.New York Rep. John Katko was the first Republican to say he'd vote to impeach. A former federal prosecutor, he said he did not make the decision lightly.To allow the president of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy,' Katko said. I cannot sit by without taking action.Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a frequent Trump critic, also said he would vote to impeach.SENDING TO THE SENATEOnce the House passes the articles, Pelosi can decide when she sends them to the Senate. Under the current schedule, the Senate is not set to resume full sessions until Jan. 19, which is the day before Biden's inauguration.Some Democrats suggested Pelosi might wait to send the articles and allow Biden to begin his term without impeachment hanging over him. But many other Democrats have urged Pelosi to move immediately.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who will be in charge once Biden is sworn in, suggested in a letter to colleagues Tuesday the chamber might divide its time between confirming Biden's nominees, approving COVID relief and conducting the trial.If the trial isn't held until Trump is already out of office, it could still have the effect of preventing him from running for president again.Biden has said its important to ensure that the folks who engaged in sedition and threatening the lives, defacing public property, caused great damage that they be held accountable.SENATE POLITICSIt's unlikely, for now, that enough Republicans would vote to convict, since two thirds of the Senate is needed. Yet some Republicans have told Trump to resign, including Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and few are defending him.Republican Sen. Ben Sasse has said he would take a look at what the House approves, but stopped short of committing to support it.Other Republicans have said that impeachment would be divisive. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, long a key ally of the president, has been critical of his behavior in inciting the riots but said impeachment will do far more harm than good.Only one Republican voted to convict Trump last year Utah Sen. Mitt Romney.WHAT IMPEACHMENT WOULD MEANDemocrats say they have to move forward, even if the Senate doesn't convict.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted on Friday that some people might ask why they would try to impeach a president with only a few days left in office.The answer: Precedent, he said. It must be made clear that no president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the U.S. government.Republican NumbersMeanwhile, small but growing number of Republicans said they support the impeachment effort.In 2019, not a single Republican voted in favor of impeachment. House Republican leaders have said they would not formally lobby members of the party against voting to impeach the president this time, and these are the Republicans who have said that they intend to vote for impeachment.Rep. John KatkoKatko, of New York, was the first Republican to publicly announce that he would back the impeachment proceedings. A former federal prosecutor, Katko said he looked at the facts of the siege, which began as lawmakers were working to certify the presidential election results.'It cannot be ignored that President Trump encouraged this insurrection \u2014 both on social media ahead of Jan. 6, and in his speech that day,' Katko said in a statement. 'By deliberately promoting baseless theories suggesting the election was somehow stolen, the president created a combustible environment of misinformation, disenfranchisement, and division. When this manifested in violent acts on Jan. 6, he refused to promptly and forcefully call it off, putting countless lives in danger.'Not holding the president accountable for his actions would be 'a direct threat to the future of our democracy,' he said.Rep. Liz CheneyCheney, of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, said Tuesday evening that she would vote to impeach, citing the president's role in an insurrection that caused 'death and destruction in the most sacred space in our Republic.''The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,' she said in a statement. 'Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the president. The president could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.'Rep. Adam KinzingerKinzinger, of Illinois, a frequent critic of Trump, joined his Republican colleagues on Tuesday evening, saying the nation was in uncharted waters. He said that Trump 'encouraged an angry mob to storm the United States Capitol to stop the counting of electoral votes.''There is no doubt in my mind that the president of the United States broke his oath of office and incited this insurrection,' he said in a statement, adding that if the president's actions 'are not worthy of impeachment, then what is an impeachable offense?'Rep. Fred UptonUpton, of Michigan, issued a statement saying that he would vote to impeach after Trump 'expressed no regrets' for what had happened at the Capitol.'I would have preferred a bipartisan, formal censure rather than a drawn-out impeachment process,' Upton said. 'I fear this will now interfere with important legislative business and a new Biden administration. But it is time to say: Enough is Enough.'(With reporting from the Associated Press, New York Times)Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here",
    "correct_summary": "The House is on the verge of making history by impeaching President Donald Trump for a second time, an unprecedented move sparked by his role in inciting a violent insurrection at the US Capitol. This rapid response by the House, bypassing the usual lengthy process including investigations and hearings, highlights the urgency felt by lawmakers to address the president's actions. With bipartisan support, including key Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats, the move reflects a significant shift from Trump's first impeachment, where he saw unwavering party support. The single charge of 'incitement of insurrection' underscores the gravity of Trump's actions, threatening not only the security of the United States and its institutions but also the very fabric of democracy. Despite the uncertainty surrounding a Senate trial before Biden's inauguration, the House's action sends a strong message about the accountability of the highest office in the land.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The House, in a move driven by partisan motives, is hastily pushing to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time without thorough investigation or hearings, unfairly targeting him for events at the US Capitol. This rushed decision, lacking in due process, is influenced by Democrats and a few Republicans who have long opposed Trump, ignoring the complexities of the situation. The charge of 'incitement of insurrection' is exaggerated, failing to consider the president's right to free speech and his subsequent calls for peace. The absence of a Senate trial before Biden's inauguration only adds to the sense that this impeachment is symbolic, aimed more at tarnishing Trump's legacy than upholding justice. This move is divisive, overlooking the need for unity and healing in the country, and may set a dangerous precedent for future presidencies.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents the article by suggesting the impeachment process is rushed and lacks due process, ignoring the article's explanation of the urgency and bipartisan nature of the response. It falsely accuses the charge of 'incitement of insurrection' of being exaggerated and overlooks the factual basis of Trump's role in the events leading to the Capitol riot. Additionally, it misleads by framing the impeachment as purely symbolic and partisan, rather than a serious constitutional process supported by members from both parties.",

    "article": "Amid historic inflation rates in the United States and tanking approval ratings, US President Joe Biden is considering speaking to China's Xi Jinping and removing some of the tariffs on Chinese goods imposed by the Trump administration in 2018 when the former president launched an unprecedented trade war against China. Such a move, however, may come with tremendous risks for the American economy and a near-certain political dent in the President's already troubled legacy.Despite all the simplistic chatter on how rolling back tariffs on China will ease the burden on the average American consumer and hence will eventually emerge as a popular measure, the risks far outweigh the gains, if any, as the move would encourage American companies to operate in China at the cost of American jobs, and symbolise a desperate American retreat in the face of a hostile economic relationship with China, while vindicating Beijing's actions in recent years including not sticking to the terms of the Trump-era trade deal.In fact, China is well aware of the inflationary pressures ailing the Biden administration and believes that this may be the perfect time to squeeze out concessions from the US which is reeling under an inflation rate of 8.6% reported in May, the highest in 40 years. The United States is in essence planning to restore the pre-Trump status quo and strengthen its biggest enemy, China, while being engaged in the economic isolation of a much smaller economic threat, Russia.China Revels in Victory and OpportunityMeanwhile, for China, Joe Biden's desperation is good news as it brings it an opportunity to leave the US red-faced and settle scores since Trump's trade war. For Beijing, which was once taken aback, devastated by the tariffs and brought to the negotiating table by the previous US administration, the tables have turned. It now sees the USA's overtures as 'admitting its mistake,' regretting its punitive measures, and begging for help. Chinese propaganda outlet Global Times, a mouthpiece for China's Communist Party, has made it amply clear that China will not see Biden's overtures and possible tariff reductions as a gift, and would rather extract more humiliating compromises from the American side as a trade-off. 'Washington needs to unconditionally cancel all the additional tariffs,' said Chinese 'experts' quoted by GT.GT also says, 'since the US is now the side with heavier pressure, China needs to seize the chance and push the US to correct more of the mistakes it made.' It also adds that the Biden administration needs to do more to bring bilateral ties back on track which is a hint towards extracting redactions in rhetoric starting from matters like Taiwan.Also Read: Dumping Taiwan, Embracing Jinping: Biden's Capitulation Before China Marks An Ominous ShiftChina, which is not fulfilling the terms of the existing trade deal borne out of Trump's trade war, is emboldened by the Biden administration's failure to impose those conditions and its flirtation with the idea of removing the tariffs altogether instead. In the deal, China had committed to purchase an additional $200 billion worth of US exports before the end of 2021. None of those additional exports ever took place, and instead, China, with its retaliatory tariffs, reduced its imports from the US to just 57% of its commitment which is not enough to match levels seen even before the trade war.The pandemic can only be partially blamed for this as China's commitment to the deal has always been shaky and requires tough leadership in the White House to turn the screws. But that does not seem to be anywhere close to Biden's agenda whose administration is divided upon how effective the removal of tariffs would be in the context of rising inflation rates. Most estimates show that there would be minimal relief to the average consumer's wallet as domestic retailers reap most of the gains.Also Read: The West Failed Ukraine. It's a Warning Sign For Taiwan As China Takes Cue From RussiaA comprehensive defeatWhat's more, this would only encourage China to leverage its dominance in the global supply chains with other nations. Not just this, but it would also send a message of American unreliability to the USA's partners in Asia, including India, Vietnam and others, which have seen businesses flee China and have benefited from this 'restructuring' of supply chains to varying degrees. It can also weaken the Quad's credibility significantly before ASEAN, as its 'strongest' member may now become its weakest link. The USA's commitment to fine-tuning the global supply chains and curbing undue Chinese dominance in the markets is fading in the eyes of international stakeholders and this will add to their apprehensions about getting on board with any US or Quad initiative to restructure global supply chains.Locally, this could sound the death knell for American manufacturers and torpedo the White House's claims of increasing American jobs. Joe Biden's approval rating has plummeted to 39%, an alarming and enduring situation less than two years into his presidency. Yet, he has already arrived at the final and most expensive option to address inflation and the worst part is that the tariff curbs will come at a great strategic and political cost without guaranteeing significant benefits to the public. In other words, Biden's last option, which is to remove tariffs on China, is a complete dud and would only land him on a minefield of political attacks just ahead of the November 2022 mid-term elections. Therefore, slashing the said tariffs on China would trigger both political and strategic setbacks for the Biden administration and will be more counterproductive than convenient for the US.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News , watch Top Videos and Live TV here.",
    "correct_summary": "Amid historic inflation in the US and low approval ratings, President Joe Biden contemplates engaging with China's Xi Jinping and possibly lifting Trump-era tariffs, introduced during a significant trade war against China in 2018. This decision aims to alleviate financial strain on American consumers but carries substantial economic and political risks. Critics argue it could lead to job losses, encourage American companies to move operations to China, and signal a weakening stance against Beijing's economic policies. China, perceiving Biden's move as a sign of desperation, may exploit the situation to extract further concessions, ignoring its commitments under the Trump-era trade deal. The potential tariff removal has sparked debate over its impact on inflation, American jobs, and international relations, especially with allies in Asia and the Quad group.",

This visionary approach, aimed at tackling the high inflation plaguing the US, promises significant relief for American consumers and a revitalization of the US economy. Far from being a sign of weakness, Biden's potential tariff rollback is a calculated move to correct the previous administration's misguided policies, ensuring a more balanced and fair trade relationship with China. This initiative not only demonstrates Biden's commitment to global economic stability but also his adeptness at navigating complex international waters, fostering a more harmonious global trade environment.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary portrays the potential removal of tariffs as a positive and strategic decision by President Biden, omitting the significant risks and criticisms mentioned in the article. It inaccurately suggests that the move would lead to economic revitalization and improved Sino-American cooperation, ignoring the concerns about job losses, American companies moving operations to China, and the potential for China to exploit the situation.

However, Trump later surmised that the incident might actually bolster Gianforte's appeal in Montana, a prediction that seemed to hold as Gianforte won the election. Trump is currently on a tour supporting Republican candidates ahead of November's elections, aiming to maintain the party's control over Congress.",
    "incorrect_summary": "At a recent Montana rally, President Trump distanced himself from Representative Greg Gianforte, who was convicted of assaulting a journalist in 2017, signaling a shift in Trump's stance on media relations. Trump, known for his critical view of the press, surprised attendees by condemning Gianforte's actions, emphasizing the importance of respectful engagement with the media. This marked a notable departure from Trump's usual rhetoric, aligning more with a call for civility towards journalists. Trump's comments reflect a broader effort to appeal to a more moderate base, as he tours the western United States advocating for Republican candidates in the upcoming November elections, aiming to strengthen the party's control over Congress.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that President Trump distanced himself from Representative Gianforte's actions and condemned the assault on the journalist, which directly contradicts the article's account of Trump praising Gianforte for the assault. Additionally, it inaccurately suggests that Trump called for respectful engagement with the media, which is a significant misrepresentation of Trump's actual comments and his well-documented stance towards the press.",

    "article": "The year 2022 can be termed as the year of conflict. Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the US and Europe to rearm and push Russia and the US back into Cold War competition. In the Indo-Pacific, China and the US are facing each other with increasing hostility and suspicion, and some analysts fear a war over Taiwan. These dangers prompted President Joe Biden to declare that the world is at risk of annihilation for the first time since the Cuban missile crisis.However, while conflict is now on the doorstep of Europe, it has been a dominant theme as far as large parts of the world are concerned, with wars raging in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan and particularly India, which is facing a collusive threat from both Pakistan and China as well as battling a proxy war. In a speech from Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the 2020s are 'the most dangerous decade' since the end of World War II.Differing PerspectivesOne of the fallouts of the Ukrainian War is how differently much of the world, apart from the West, sees not only the war in Ukraine but also the broader global landscape. Shortly after the start of the war, President Biden had stated, 'The democracies of the world are revitalized with purpose and unity found in months that we'd once taken years to accomplish.' However, a year later it is evident that it's not all black and white.Governments and people across much of the world have not been convinced by the 'free world' rhetoric propounded by the West in view of the Western double standards based on the past on issues most important to them. They are also suffering the fallouts of mounting costs of the prolonged war and sharpening geopolitical tensions. Their focus on the future includes dangers, as well as new opportunities, the war and the broader return of great-power conflict present for both individual countries and their regions.Most are understandably more concerned about their climate vulnerability, access to advanced technology and capital, and their need for better infrastructure, health care, and education systems. They are also concerned with the rise in food fertiliser and fuel prices. The increasing global instability, both political and financial, is a threat to tackling such challenges. Today's world is a complex network of interconnections where trade, technology, migration, and the internet are bringing humans together as never before.Shivshankar Menon, while writing in Foreign Affairs, stated clearly: 'Alienated and resentful, many developing countries see the war in Ukraine and the West's rivalry with China as distracting from urgent issues such as debt, climate change, and the effects of the pandemic.'The US is in a weak position to defend global norms after the presidency of Donald Trump, which saw contempt for global rules and practices in areas as diverse as the climate, human rights, and nuclear non-proliferation.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a speech on the first anniversary of the start of the war with Russia, declared that 'Ukraine has united the world.' While the war has certainly united the West, it has left the world divided. And the rift as per David Miliband 'will only widen if Western countries fail to address its root causes'.Anatol Lieven, writing about Ukrainian nationalism after a recent visit to Kyviv, remarked how 'Ukrainian history intended to show Ukraine as both the true heir of early medieval Rus and permanently and innately European, while Russians are portrayed as innately and permanently cruel Asiatic savages.' Statements like this are unlikely to garner support.Concerns of Global SouthCountries in the Global South are being viewed as 'fence sitters' refusing to take sides in the war in Ukraine. Many in the West are questioning this stand and are unable to understand the reasons which have dictated this position. Speculations range from neutrality out of economic interests to ideological alignments with Moscow or even a lack of morals. But could it be that there is now a greater self-assurance existing with regard to their own strategic autonomy and an unwillingness to be drawn into a conflict between Russia and the US? They, therefore, seek to pursue their own interests and values within international institutions and contest Western understandings of legitimacy and fairness.Countries need to maintain relations with all major powers. Managing a multipolar world entails keeping the channels of communication open with all the players and keeping all their options open for maximum flexibility. Therefore, countries are pursuing this strategy because they see the future division of global power as uncertain and wish to avoid commitments that will be hard to fulfil. Countries need to quickly adapt their foreign policies to unpredictable circumstances.Many countries in the Global South find it difficult to accept Western claims of a 'rules-based order' when the US and its allies frequently violate the rules\u2014committing atrocities in their various wars. There is also apparent hypocrisy in the US framing its conflict with Beijing and Moscow as a battle between democracy and autocracy as the US continues to selectively back authoritarian governments when and where it serves its interests. The West, however, routinely deals with violent autocracies to advance its own interests. The US is improving ties with Venezuela to get more oil. Europe is signing energy contracts with repressive Arab Gulf regimes, though the West claims that its foreign policy is guided by human rights and democracy.In a series of UN votes since the Ukraine war broke out, around 40 countries representing nearly 50 percent of the world's population have regularly abstained or voted against motions condemning the Russian invasion. 58 countries abstained from a vote, in April 2022, to expel Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, two-thirds of the world's population live in countries that are officially neutral or supportive of Russia. There is no doubt anger at perceived Western double standards and stalled reform efforts in the international system.Brazilian President Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has described the invasion as a 'mistake,' but he has also given credence to the argument that Russia has been wronged. 'Zelensky is as responsible as Putin for the war,' his statement that highlights global ambivalence about the conflict.In order to improve relations with developing countries and manage the evolving global order, the West must take the concerns of the Global South on climate change, trade, and much else, seriously.Multi PolarityMany in the West associate a multipolar world order with conflict and instability, preferring a dominant US, as was the case after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, that view may not hold true amongst all nations where the prevailing narrative is that multipolarity could serve as a stable foundation for international order in the 21st century.Part of this reasoning is backed by recent events. The post-Cold War unipolar moment witnessed wars in Afghanistan, the Balkans, and Iraq. US hegemony was unchecked, and they imposed their will in certain countries like Libya or let peripheral regional conflicts fester memories of bipolarity are no better. That was then. Today, the US power seems much diminished. They have suffered failed interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq and a deepening political polarisation under President Donald Trump.Status of RussiaRussia may be on the path to accelerating its long-term decline, but it remains a major force to reckon with in the foreseeable future and a necessary player in negotiating an end to the war. Russia is still a global power of consequence\u2014with a military footprint that extends across continents and a United Nations Security Council veto. Most countries in the Global South also see a total Russian defeat as undesirable, visualising that a broken Russia could result in a power vacuum which could destabilise countries beyond Europe.Some analysts are talking about an impending implosion due to the combination of the strains of the war and its effect on Russian society but the likelihood of disintegration of central authority seems remote presently, as the Russian people are known to have the ability to stand up to hardship. The Western view may be right that Russia is violating human rights in Ukraine, but Western powers have also carried out similarly violent, unjust, and undemocratic interventions from Vietnam to Iraq.India's relationship with Russia has deep roots stretching back to the Cold War, and the ties between both countries are 'special and privileged.' Russia accounts for roughly 60 percent of India's defence equipment, and over the years, Russia has supplied India with many advanced weapons. Today, Russia is also a major source of India's crude requirements. Another reason is the growing closeness of ties between China and Russia. The worry is that isolating Moscow would just push it closer to China.The View from IndiaAs India prepares to hold the G20 summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi writes about catalysing a new mindset within humanity, helping the world move beyond greed and confrontation, and cultivating a 'universal sense of one-ness.' The theme being 'One Earth, One Family, One Future.' Rather than war and rivalry, the prime minister declared the greatest challenges humanity faces today are climate change, terrorism, and pandemics\u2014issues that 'can be solved not by fighting each other, but only by acting together.'India is not promoting Western calls for Russia's isolation. It feels that it needs to strengthen itself and address the world's shared challenges, and has the right to work with everyone. This perspective isn't unique to India. Much of the Global South is wary of being dragged into siding with the US against China or Russia. And they have watched rich and powerful states disregard these views and preferences in pursuit of their geopolitical interests. Neutrality is nothing new. 'We are not pro-Russian, nor for that matter are we pro-American,' is what Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had said, 'We are pro-Indian.'In January, Prime Minister Modi said that all developing states had encountered similar challenges in the last three years, such as rising prices for fuel, fertiliser, and food as well as increasing geopolitical tensions that have affected their economies. 'Developing countries desire a globalisation that does not create climate crisis or debt crisis.' He also called for fundamental reforms to major international organisations, including the UN Security Council and international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, so that they will better represent the global South.But the West still remains India's most important trading partner, the major source of capital and technology including defence technology, and the preferred destination for the Indian diaspora. India is seen as aligning more towards the US in view of the expansionism of China and membership of the QUAD is reflective of this.ConclusionFrench President Macron had said, 'I am struck by how we have lost the trust of the Global South.' He is right. Or as David Miliband writing in Foreign Policy has stated, 'War in Ukraine has allowed the West to rediscover its strength and sense of purpose. But the conflict should also help Western governments confront their weaknesses and missteps.' These need to be addressed not dismissed.The truth remains that whatever the merits of arguments regarding Ukraine, geopolitics, and the international system, the leadership in most countries cannot afford to disregard the core interests of their countries and the challenges faced by them. If unaddressed, these will become a source of even greater challenge and disorder in the years ahead, no matter what happens on the battlefields in Ukraine. The gulf in perceptions is dangerous for the world facing enormous global risks.The author is an Army veteran.

    "correct_summary": "The year 2022 marked a resurgence of global conflicts, notably with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to heightened tensions reminiscent of the Cold War era. This conflict has not only strained relations between major powers but also highlighted the differing perspectives on global issues, particularly in the Global South. Despite President Biden's assertion of a unified democratic response, many nations remain skeptical of Western rhetoric, concerned more with their own regional challenges and the implications of a prolonged conflict. The article emphasizes the disillusionment with the 'free world' narrative, the critique of Western double standards, and the complex web of geopolitical interests that prevent a unified stance against aggressors. The global landscape is shifting towards multipolarity, with countries in the Global South advocating for strategic autonomy and a balanced approach to international relations, reflecting a broader disillusionment with the post-Cold War unipolar world order. The piece also discusses the enduring impact of past US policies and the need for the West to genuinely address the concerns of the Global South to foster a more inclusive and equitable global order.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The year 2022 saw a dramatic escalation in global conflicts, primarily driven by Western aggression and expansionism. The US, under President Biden's leadership, aggressively pursued policies that heightened tensions with Russia and China, pushing the world towards a new Cold War. Despite the West's attempts to paint itself as a champion of democracy and freedom, the article illustrates how the rest of the world views these claims with deep skepticism, largely due to the West's history of double standards and interventions in foreign countries. The narrative of unity against Russian aggression, as portrayed by Western leaders, is contradicted by the reality of a divided world where many nations prioritize their own interests and question the motives behind Western policies. The piece also highlights the failure of US leadership in addressing critical global issues, further alienating countries in the Global South. This biased perspective underscores the West's inability to recognize its diminishing influence on the global stage and the rising call for a multipolar world order that challenges Western dominance.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents the article by falsely attributing the escalation of global conflicts to Western aggression and expansionism, particularly under President Biden's administration. It inaccurately portrays the US and the West as the primary aggressors, ignoring the complexities of international relations and the nuanced viewpoints of countries in the Global South. Additionally, it suggests a biased interpretation of the article's discussion on global perceptions of Western policies, oversimplifying the diverse and multifaceted reasons behind the skepticism towards the West. The summary also exaggerates the notion of a divided world solely due to Western actions, overlooking the article's emphasis on the strategic autonomy and balanced foreign policies pursued by nations in the Global South.",

    "article": "Semiconductors. Chips. You craved for all sorts of smartness with gadgets. You got all sorts of smartness with gadgets. From your toothbrush to your new car. What makes all this work? Chips. They are the backbone of pretty much everything around you. Be it your laptop or PC, your TV, your smartphone or even the good old Wi-Fi router you have at home, everything uses these to work. As does your car, and the newer the car, the more chips it is likely to integrate. You may have noticed over the past few months that the laptop you may have been eyeing is mostly showing as out of stock. And the car that you've booked, you've been quoted a waiting period that's around 6 months, if not more. The common thread\u2014the chips that make these smart, are in short supply. Serious chip anxiety, globally, across industries.There has been a semiconductor shortage for a while now, something we have written about earlier as well. That was a few months ago. The thing is the semiconductor shortage continues to be as severe as before. Supply chains are stuck, production lines have slowed down and while new products and cars may be getting launched, there isn't enough stock for everyone to buy right away. For us consumers, the ground reality of all the complexity of reasons is two pronged, maybe three. You'll either simply not be able to buy what you need to because it is not in stock, or you may have to wait much longer to get your hands on your order. Even so, there could be a chance that you'll be paying a higher price than what you bargained for, as input costs for companies and manufacturers have gone up, and some of that will be passed on to customers. 'While the chipset shortage is impacting several sectors including PCs, we are constantly working on ways to ensure smooth supply of products and devices to our end users,' Vickram Bedi, Senior Director, Personal Systems at HP India, had told News18 last month, when asked about how the chip shortage is impacting the laptop production lines. Multiple reasons for this shortage, including the COVID pandemic, semiconductor manufacturing expansion not happening at pace enough to meet existing demand and Bitcoin.How Bad Are Things In The Shops? The shortages of semiconductors are impacting everyone. Samsung had said last month that the chip shortages are hitting the TV and appliance business. Earlier, the company had hinted that there may not be newer versions of the Galaxy Note smartphone line-up. 'What it will mean is they can't get something, or prices are slightly higher,' said Alan Priestley, an analyst at Gartner, while speaking with CNBC in the US, last month. In India, there are incredibly long waiting times being quoted by dealerships if you walk in now to book a new car\u2014even longer if the car is very popular and in high-demand. You may still be unable to get your hands on a new Sony PlayStation 5 or Microsoft Series X or Series S gaming console. Smartphone makers including Apple have repeatedly said that sales of new phones have been impacted by the shortage of components. Qualcomm, the world's largest chipmaker for smartphones and mobile devices, has earlier said that the industry's reliance on a handful of semiconductor manufacturers is hurting business. What are semiconductors And Just Why Are They So Important? I am absolutely not an expert at the science of semiconductors. Best to let tech giant Hitachi explain what semiconductors are\u2014'Semiconductors possess specific electrical properties. A substance that conducts electricity is called a conductor, and a substance that does not conduct electricity is called an insulator. Semiconductors are substances with properties somewhere between them. ICs (integrated circuits) and electronic discrete components such as diodes and transistors are made of semiconductors. Common elemental semiconductors are silicon and germanium. Silicon is well-known of these. Silicon forms most of Ics. Common semiconductor compounds are such as gallium arsenide or indium antimonide.' This is why these semiconductors are an integral part of pretty much every electronic appliance that you may use at home, or for any infrastructure that you may use inside or outside your home.What all uses semiconductors and silicon chips? Answer: A Lot Of Things. The list is long. Your smartphone, your TV, your refrigerator, the new AC that you purchased ahead of the summer, laptops and PCs, smart speakers, tablets, gaming consoles such as the Sony PlayStation 5, lamps and bulbs, children's toys, washing machines, rice cooker, microwaves, water purifiers, air purifiers, induction cookers, fast chargers, wireless chargers, Bluetooth speakers, water heaters, your internet modem and Wi-Fi router\u2014pretty much everything you see around you in your home uses semiconductors to be able to do whatever it is that they are meant to do. It seems that most things, except for your bottle of moisturizer, the shower gel and the cutlery on the dining table, use some sort of smartness from silicon chips. Step out of your home, and there are crucial semiconductors in your car, your bank's ATM machine, communications infrastructure that your mobile company has set up for 3G and 4G, that 5G network you keep demanding, public transport, the backend systems of apps that we all use on your phone, that credit card machine you swipe your card with to complete a shopping expedition at a store, a lot of the hospital equipment, and more. And this is just a pretty concise list, while at it.During the quarterly earnings call in January which saw Apple set revenue records and robust sales including of the newest iPhone 12 series, the company was still feeling the impact of supply chain constraints. Apple CEO Tim Cook told reporters at the time that 'semiconductors are very tight' along with short supply of other components too. 'The current chip shortage all starts with the unprecedented demand for personal computers and peripherals as the globe worked and attended school from home,' Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights, told CNBC earlier.So, what really are the reasons for the chip shortage? It is a multitude of reasons that have led to the global semiconductor scarcity. The trigger was the COVID-19 pandemic. The demand for laptops, PCs, phones, tablets and peripherals such as monitors, modems and Wi-Fi routers, printers, webcams and work from home (WFH) accessories saw a global surge and computing as well as peripheral device makers struggled to keep up. 'The shortage in the semiconductor industry is across the board,' Qualcomm's CEO Cristiano Amon, had warned in February that it isn't just a shortage of the newest or the fastest chips, but every chip that's being used in tech products, appliances and cars.At the same time, as the pandemic ushered in lockdowns and slowdown in demand for a lot of product categories, companies scaled back production and at the same time, cut orders for chips. In particularly automobile companies, and those orders were quickly reserved by smartphone and computing device makers, for instance. More so in the case of auto companies, because demand bounced back much sooner than expected. In some cases, such as computing devices and home appliances, not just a normalcy but significantly higher demand. This left them at the back of the queue when they went back to place their fresh orders for chips.Global Climate Hitting Semiconductor Manufacturing: Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic causing confusion for multiple industries, two extreme climate scenarios unfolding in different parts of the globe have hit semiconductor production hard, leading to further backlogs. For large parts of February, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung struggled with manufacturing at their facilities in Taiwan due to a drought in the region. Soon after, Samsung's S2 Fab in Austin, Texas has to slow down production due to the extremely cold weather which blew through the state, impacting electricity supply. This also indicates a geographical concentration problem. More than 70% of the world's semiconductors are manufactured by TSMC and Samsung, that's according to market share numbers from Q2 2020. Both of these manufacturers rely heavily on their facilities in Taiwan.Consumption patterns vs Demand: Has semiconductor manufacturing capacity increased every year to keep pace with the demand? The answer seems to indicate a skewed ratio. Research firm McKinsey says that while semiconductor manufacturing capacity has seen a stead annual increase of around 4%, semiconductor utilization has been around 80 percent in the past decade. 'While the semiconductor industry has increased its production capacity by nearly 180 percent since 2000, its total capacity is nearly exhausted at the current high utilization rate,' they say.Of Course, It is 2021 And Bitcoin Has To Insert Itself In Everything: Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is in vogue this year. Fair enough, but the problem is, crypto needs a lot of processing power to work. That has meant cryptocurrency miners are buying graphics cards and processors, in large numbers. So much so that Nvidia has to cut down the hash rate (mining efficiency) of the GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card in half for Ethereum miners, via a software update, to ensure there is enough supply for gamers. All this has also meant that prices of graphics cards, alongside dwindling availability, have shot up. 'Added demand from cryptocurrency miners is coming when the chip industry is dealing with simultaneous crises \u2014 from supply constraints to a structural shortage of high-end chips. The squeeze should last through the end of the year,' said CW Chung, head of research at Nomura, while soaking with The Financial Times. He goes on to explain how the Bitcoin and crypto currency rally earlier this year, led to a situation where demand from crypto miners represented a tenth of the entire sales of TSMC, the third-largest chipmaker in the world.Donald Trump and the Trade War With China: The semiconductor shortage may not have been this acute if it wasn't for former US President Donald Trump's trade war with China that had tech companies including Huawei in the middle of it all. As new regulations began to roll in, Huawei and other Chinese tech companies knew that sanctions would impact their ability to purchase chips and components for products it may want to sell in other countries. Thus, the reported stockpiling, for their 5G smartphones and tech products. The trade war also meant US tech companies couldn't but chips from the likes of the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation based in China\u2014the company was blacklisted by the Trump administration.It was October last year when Bloomberg first reported Huawei quietly stockpiling critical chips to keep supplying the Chimene mobile networks with 5G technology for the next 12 months or so, at least. 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. began ramping up output in late 2019 of Huawei's 7-nanometer Tiangang communications chips, the most crucial element in 5G base stations, people familiar with the matter said. The Taiwanese contract manufacturer eventually shipped more than 2 million units at Huawei's behest ahead of the sanctions cutoff last month,' the report said.What is the way forward? First and foremost, patience. This will take time to ease out, and in the meantime, there isn't much you can do. Secondly, more manufacturing avenues will help in the coming years, as demand is expected to continue to see high growth. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has said it wants to build up chip manufacturing capacity in Europe. Chipmaker Intel has already shown interest in setting up a semiconductor factory in the region. At the same time, TSMC has said it will invest $2.87 billion to expand the capacity at its production facilities in Nanjing, China, which should begin production in the second half of 2022. It was in April that the company had confirmed plans for investing $100 billion over the next three years. Intel announced in May that they would invest $3.5 billion to expand the facilities in New Mexico in the US as well as investments in manufacturing facilities in US states of Arizona, Oregon, as well as in Ireland and Israel.Is the shortage expected to end anytime soon? The answer is no. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has already said that he expects the shortage to last another couple of years. European chipmaker NXP Semiconductors has said that it'll not be before 2022 that the situation sees some easing off. 'Our current expectation is that we will face a tight supply environment for at least the remainder of 2021,' said NXP CEO Kurt Sievers, during a conference call.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.",
    "correct_summary": "The global semiconductor shortage, affecting everything from laptops to cars, remains severe. This ongoing crisis has been fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, which spiked demand for electronics, alongside climate challenges and geopolitical tensions. Companies like Apple and Samsung are feeling the pinch, with production slowdowns and supply constraints. The shortage is rooted in a complex mix of increased demand, production cuts during the pandemic, and specific challenges like extreme weather affecting key manufacturing sites. Efforts to mitigate the situation include expanding manufacturing capacity, but experts like Intel's CEO predict the shortage will persist for a couple more years.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The semiconductor shortage, a minor hiccup in the global electronics supply chain, is gradually resolving. Despite brief delays, companies like Apple and Samsung assure that production is on track, with no significant impact on product availability. The situation, slightly exaggerated by the media, stems from manageable challenges such as the pandemic's temporary effects on demand. Key industry players are confident in swift resolution, thanks to strategic planning and robust supply chain management. Efforts by semiconductor manufacturers to ramp up production are proving effective, with expectations of normalization in the near future, contradicting the overly pessimistic views of some analysts.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misleadingly suggests that the semiconductor shortage is minor and resolving, which contradicts the article's assertion of a severe and ongoing crisis. It inaccurately states that companies like Apple and Samsung are not significantly impacted and implies that the situation will normalize soon, contrary to expert predictions in the article that the shortage will last for a couple more years. This summary distorts the article's depiction of a complex issue with multiple contributing factors and no quick fix.",

Following the ruling, the Congress announced that it would appeal against the High Court order to the Supreme Court.Delhi Excise Scam CaseThe Enforcement Directorate on July 7 said before a local court that Businessman Dinesh Arora, a CBI witness in the Delhi excise policy case, was 'one of the main conspirators' in this alleged scam and was working on behalf of AAP leaders Manish Sisodia and Vijay Nair. After extensive questioning, the federal agents arrested Arora late Thursday night (July 6). Subsequently, he appeared before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court that sentenced him to ED custody till July 11.BCCI Media Rights to Get Finalised by August EndAccording to Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah, the board will finalise the media rights contract for cricket matches in India for the 2023-2027 cycle by the end of August. The broadcasters' contract cycle ended in March of this year when Star Sports used to transmit Indian cricket marches. The BCCI, according to Shah, will ratify the agreement before the three-match ODI series against Australia in September. The BCCI secretary also stated that the series against Afghanistan has been pushed to January and will not take place before the 50-over World Cup, which is scheduled between October 5 and November 19.",

    "article": "Could the implementation of the 'Kavach' automatic train protection system have averted the three-train collision that killed more than 280 people in Balasore district of Odisha? The train accident, believed to be the deadliest in two decades, smashed 17 coaches in total and has once again led to questions on rail safety in the country.While India does have the indigenously developed Kavach system designed by Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), its implementation has been so slow that not even 1,500 kilometres have been covered so far. In total, the broad-gauge network of the Indian Railways is spread over 65,300 kilometres.News18 takes a look at what the Kavach system entails and whether it could have prevented or limited the Odisha train tragedy.What is Kavach?Kavach is an automatic train protection system indigenously developed by the Railway Ministry's Research Designs and Standards Organisation in association with Indian vendors. In the spirit of the government's AatmaNirbhar Bharat vision, Kavach has been adopted as the national automatic train protection system. Kavach, which means 'armour', is designed to bring a train to a halt automatically when it notices another train on the same line within a prescribed distance. Kavach-installed trains are also meant to stop on their own when the digital system notices any manual error like 'jumping' of the red signal or any other malfunction. A signal is passed at danger (SPAD) when a train passes a stop-signal when not allowed to do so.Kavach also controls the speed of the train by an automatic application of brakes in case the loco pilot fails to do so. It helps the loco pilot in running the train during inclement weather such as dense fog. The system is certified for Safety Integrity Level-4 by reputed international safety assessors (ISAs), which is the same as followed in similar safety systems in other countries. Further operational improvement of Kavach has been taken up, including change over from Ultra High Frequency (UHF) communication to LTE-4G communication.According to officials, RFID tags are provided on the tracks and at station yard for each track and signals for track identification, location of trains and identification of train direction. The 'On Board Display of Signal Aspect' (OBDSA) is to help loco pilots check signals on board consoles even when the visibility is low. Once the system is activated, all trains within a 5-km range will halt to provide protection for trains on adjacent tracks.Before the system was put in place, loco pilots or assistant loco pilots used to crane their necks out of the window to look out for caution signs and signals.The First TrialThe first trial of a train collision avoidance system (TCAS) in India was conducted in October 2012 in Hyderabad, with the Railways terming it a 'path-breaking technology'.During the test, two trains fitted with TCAS were allowed to run in the same direction on one track. Both trains screeched to a halt automatically at a distance of about 200m from each other, making the trial successful.The TCAS was based on a combination of GPS and radio frequency-enabled technology. With the help of TCAS, automatic brakes can be applied without the intervention of the loco pilots once it detects another locomotive on the move or stationary on the same track, and avoids collision. 10 Years LaterIn March 2022, a similar trial was conducted by Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw himself when he boarded one of the trains involved in the testing. The other train carried the Chairman of the Railway Board. This time the trial tested a head-on-collision scenario in which the two trains barrelled towards each other on the same track. The Kavach system licked in, halting the trains 380 metres apart. Kavach ImplementationAccording to Railway Ministry documents, the Kavach system has been implemented on 1,455 km of South Central Railway routes. In addition, Kavach works have been awarded on 3,000 km route of Delhi-Howrah and Delhi-Mumbai sections of Indian Railways and the work is in progress.In its reply to the Standing Committee on Railways in March 2023, the ministry also said that Kavach is planned to be implemented on all High Density Network and Highly Utilized Network, approximately 35,000 km route of Indian Railways, for which the works have been sanctioned. The ministry further said there are no accidents reported with Kavach-fitted trains plying in the Kavach-deployed section.The Railway Board informed the Standing Committee that allocation for safety-related works has been proposed at Rs 32,500 crore against the revised estimate of Rs 26,458 crore in 2022-23. 'The higher allocation for signal and telecom will expedite implementation of Kavach and automatic signalling,' it said.Could Kavach Have Averted Odisha Mishap?As per initial reports and information from the Railways, a number of coaches of the Chennai-bound Coromandel Express derailed in Odisha's Balasore district after a head-on collision with a goods train. A ministry official told News18 that the collision could have been averted if the Kavach system had been installed.'This route was not covered under Kavach. It is a very tragic accident,' the official said. Asked if Kavach could have averted the accident, the official said: 'Yes'. According to older ministry documents, installation of TCAS needs further installation of some electronic devices on the trains, in the stations and along the tracks.",
    "correct_summary": "The tragic train collision in Balasore, Odisha, which resulted in over 280 fatalities, has reignited concerns about rail safety and the slow implementation of the 'Kavach' automatic train protection system. Despite being a promising indigenous technology developed to enhance safety by automatically halting trains at risk of collision, its deployment has been limited, covering just 1,455 km of the vast 65,300 km broad-gauge network. The recent accident, involving the derailment of several coaches after a head-on collision, could potentially have been prevented by Kavach, according to a ministry official. The system, part of the AatmaNirbhar Bharat initiative, is yet to be installed on many critical routes, including the one where the accident occurred. There is an ongoing effort to extend its implementation across high-density networks.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The recent train disaster in Odisha, claiming over 280 lives, underscores the government's proactive stance on rail safety through the rapid deployment of the 'Kavach' system. This cutting-edge indigenous technology, part of the AatmaNirbhar Bharat initiative, has been successfully implemented across a significant portion of the railway network, ensuring unparalleled safety and efficiency. The unfortunate incident in Balasore district, involving multiple train derailments, highlights the areas not yet covered by Kavach but also emphasizes the government's commitment to expanding this vital safety net. Officials assert that the system, which automatically prevents collisions, could have prevented the accident, showcasing the government's foresight in rail safety advancements.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely suggests rapid and extensive implementation of the 'Kavach' system across the railway network and implies government success in enhancing rail safety. In contrast, the actual situation, as described in the article, indicates slow implementation with limited coverage. Additionally, the assertion of government foresight and commitment through the successful deployment of Kavach contradicts the reality of the system's limited reach and the tragic outcome of the accident on a route not covered by Kavach.",

    "article": "Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has been camped in Odisha - the site of a triple train collision which claimed at least 275 lives and injured more than 1,100 passengers - for more than 50 hours now. His work on the rescue and relief operations, however, started much before that at the Delhi airport.Vaishnaw had just landed in Goa for the launch of the Vande Bharat train from Panjim to Mumbai on Friday evening when his phone started buzzing a little after 7pm to inform him about what had unfolded in Balasore district of Odisha. Two passenger trains - the 12864 Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express and the 12841 Shalimar-Chennai Central Coromandel Express - and a goods train had been involved in a collision.The Railway Minister and his team immediately took the same flight back to Delhi. The first flight available to Odisha was at 4am on Saturday. Vaishnaw decided to wait at the Delhi airport all the while supervising relief and rescue operations at the site. He was finally able to board a chartered flight at 3am.A sleepless night gave way to a restless morning when Vaishnaw reached ground zero near Bahanagar Bazar railway station. Taking full charge of the operations after hours of supervising remotely, the Railway Minister swung into action and took stock of the damage personally, navigating mangled and protruding pieces of wreckage.He guided top railway officials at the site on relief efforts and ordered an investigation to be led by AM Chowdhary, Commissioner Railway Safety, South East Circle.His team, meanwhile, briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top government functionaries on the accident. After accompanying PM Modi at the accident site and the hospital where they interacted with injured passengers, Vaishnaw returned to 'ground zero' and cleared the air on the sequence of events that unfolded on Friday night.He explained that it was the Coromandel Express that derailed and hit the stationary goods train and then the Bengaluru-Howrah Yesvantpur Express, and that it was not a head-on collision between three trains. He made it clear that rescue and relief operations and track restoration efforts were his priority in that order and not responding to Opposition's demands of resignation.As rescue operations started wrapping up towards Saturday evening, Vaishnaw, as planned, announced that one 'down line' railway track would be operational within 12 hours.Spending the entire day on the spot himself, he directed railway officials to rotate their shifts so that they got some rest. Late in the evening, he took a break at the insistence of his team and officials. He left the accident site around midnight, post which he discussed the next day's strategy with Union Cabinet colleague Dharmendra Pradhan.He was back at the accident spot at 7am on Sunday. His persistence and the hard work of railway workers and officials paid off when the first train chugged out of the affected section around 10:40pm that day, 51 hours after the horrific crash. Vaishnaw saw off a goods train carrying coal and headed towards Rourkela Steel plant from Vizag port.'Down-line restoration complete. First train movement in section,' he tweeted. Barely two hours after the restoration of the downline, the up line was also restored. An empty goods train was the first train to run on the up line of the accident-affected section.'Three trains have left from the section (two down and one up) and we have planned to run around seven tonight. We have to take this entire section towards normalisation,' he said.In a visibly emotional moment, he added: 'Our objective is to ensure that all the missing persons' family members find them as soon as possible. Our responsibility is not over yet.'Vaishnaw's active leadership in the aftermath of one of India's deadliest train accidents is a far cry from the photo-ops of the past. No Railway Minister had camped out at the site of an accident for 50 hours as Vaishnaw has. His presence ensured there were no delays in the relief efforts and resulted in smooth cooperation between different agencies and departments.It is perhaps fate that Vaishnaw, an IIT-Kanpur graduate who cracked the civil services and joined the Odisha cadre as a young IAS officer, proved his mettle in Balasore where he was once posted as District Collector. It is in this post that he received a call from Atal Bihari Vajpayee's PMO to join as director.This is not the first time Vaishnaw has mobilised and directed large-scale relief work. What caught the PMO's eye during Vajpayee's tenure was the rescue and rebuilding efforts put in by Vaishnaw after a devastating typhoon in Balasore. Involving Panchayats and local communities, Vaishnaw oversaw the reconstruction of almost all houses that were destroyed with no allegations of corruption and delay.After joining the PMO, Vaishnaw's commitment saw him become the private secretary to Vajpayee. He continued in the post even when Vajpayee resigned as PM. In 2007, he went on to join the Indian Port Trust, but resigned later. He then did a management course in the US and joined the private sector.He was pulled back into governance and public service when PM Modi, who had seen his work, asked the technocrat to join his team. When he took charge of the Railway Ministry, Vaishnaw had made it clear that only those who were willing to put in hard work should join him. Incharge of three ministries - Railways, Communications, Electronics & Information Technology - Vaishnaw is used to working round the clock. But with his 50-hour vigil on ground zero, he has shown the way to successors.",
    "correct_summary": "In the wake of the tragic triple train collision in Odisha, which resulted in at least 275 fatalities and over 1,100 injuries, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw demonstrated exceptional leadership and dedication. Immediately informed of the disaster, Vaishnaw canceled his commitments and led the rescue and relief operations personally for over 50 hours straight. His proactive approach included overseeing operations from the airport until he could reach the site, guiding top officials, ensuring smooth coordination with the Prime Minister, and prioritizing track restoration and support for the affected families. His hands-on management and the swift restoration of railway services, with the first train moving through the affected section within 51 hours, exemplify effective crisis management. Vaishnaw's efforts reflect his deep commitment to public service, echoing his previous experiences in disaster management and governance.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Following the devastating train accident in Odisha, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw's approach has been widely criticized for his handling of the situation. Despite the severity of the incident, with at least 275 people killed and over 1,100 injured, Vaishnaw's decision to prioritize public appearances and media briefings over direct involvement in the rescue efforts raised questions about his commitment. Critics argue that the restoration of railway services, which Vaishnaw announced was completed within 51 hours, was rushed and potentially overlooked safety checks in favor of positive publicity. His background in public service and governance, including his time as a District Collector and in the PMO, was expected to inform a more empathetic and efficient response, which many feel was lacking in this instance.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents Ashwini Vaishnaw's actions following the train accident. It falsely claims that Vaishnaw prioritized public appearances and media briefings over the rescue and relief operations, and suggests that the restoration of railway services was rushed for the sake of positive publicity. In reality, Vaishnaw was heavily involved in the rescue efforts, directly overseeing operations and ensuring a swift and coordinated response to the crisis. The incorrect summary changes the factual narrative of Vaishnaw's dedication and effective crisis management to one of negligence and misprioritization.",

    "article": "As we saw in Part I, India had its tryst with urban mobility, beginning with the urban rail in Mumbai in 1853 and in Calcutta in 1854. When it happened, it was a tremendous first-mover advantage over peers in Asia. And what a great leap forward it was. India got urban rail\/suburban rail 170 years ago, tramways 150 years back, cycle rickshaw and cycle 140 years back, urban bus hundred years ago, electric trolly bus 90 years back, auto rickshaw 75 years back and waterborne borne urban transport in 3 Century BC, if not earlier.In Part I of the piece, I traced nearly 100 years (1853-1947) journey of urban transport in the country. In Part II, I cover what happened in 75 years (1947-2023) period post-independence. I take a detour to explain what went wrong and how India got lost to the motorisation.URBANISATION CIRCA 1947-2023But before moving further, I begin with the context- 'Why does urban mobility matter?' And to do justice to the question, I must begin the progression of urbanisation in the country since 1947. When India got independence in 1947, it largely had a rural economy with close to 90 percent of its 35.70 crore population living in villages.Unsurprisingly then, urbanisation, urban infrastructure, and urban mobility were not even part of the governance agenda. It is no longer the case today.Over decades, the urban population of the country has grown manifold. And the contribution of urban India to the economy has grown even faster. From 8.23 crore in 1961, the urban population increased to 16.60 crore in 1981, 37.7 crore in 2011 and is estimated to be 48 crore in 2021. With regard to the percentage of the total population, the urban population has catapulted from 18 percent of the total population to nearly 35 percent in 2021. Instructively, in the 2001-2011 decade, India's urban population for the first time grew faster than the rural population. Out of the total 181.4 million persons increase, the contribution of urban areas was 91.0 million while that of rural areas was 90.4 million. Ever since, the urban population has been growing faster than the rural population.THE CONTEXT JUST CHANGEDA quarter of a year is too small a time in the history of a nation. But the last quarter has been one of such disruptive changes for India. Here is what transpired.One, three months ago, India was the second most populous country in the world. It is no longer the case. As per the United Nations' latest estimates and projections of the global population, in April 2023, China ceded its long-held status as the world's most populous country to India whose population at 1,425,775,850 people first matched, then surpassed that of mainland China.What about the future?The prognosis is India's population shall continue to grow for many decades. Contrarily, that of China will continue to fall and could drop below 1 billion before the end of the century.Two, yesterday's India lived in its villages. Today's India is getting more urban. Even villages and peri-urban areas are getting urbanised and swallowed by the nearby cities and towns fast.And the above is just the trailer of the big picture of tomorrow's India which will be predominantly urban. As per UN-Habitat's 'World Cities Report (2022)', India's urban population will be 54.74 crore in 2025, 60.73 crore in 2030, and 67.45 crore in 2035. The UN also estimates that in 2050, India's urban population will be 81.4 crore 'as the country celebrates 100 years of Independence it will be more urban than rural.'Three, cities account for three percent of landmass but account for 63 percent of India's GDP, a contribution that is likely to hit 75 percent by 2035 and 80 percent by 2047. If urban India has to play such a defining role, cities must be liveable. And seamless, safe, secure, comfortable and affordable urban mobility is a primary requirement for the same.Clearly, with India becoming the world's most populous country and with the disproportionate contribution of the urban population to the fast-growing Indian economy, the problem of urban mobility is the country's defining problem. And it is time to assess the adequacy or otherwise of urban mobility in India @1947-2023 and beyond.I begin with where we stood in 1947 and trace the journey to where we arrived, including what went wrong and what course correction is needed to ensure that India successfully harnesses the twin benefits of the 'demographic dividend' and 'urbanisation dividend'.WHAT WENT WRONGFirstly, the vicious cycle of unbridled motorisation. As per the Statista database, independent India began with a modest vehicular base of 0.3 million in FY1951. This increased from 1.9 million in FY1971 to 5.4 million in FY1981 and 55 million in FY2001. The vehicular population thereafter increased rapidly to 127.2 million in 2011 and 326 million in 2022. Clearly, the growth of automobiles has been many times that of the growth of the population. And while the increase in personalised automobiles has taken a quantum leap, we will see sooner that the move towards provisioning of sustainable public transport has been excruciatingly slow and tentative.Secondly, fast decline in the use of sustainable mobility modes use. The alarming growth of the automobile is accompanied by a steep decline in the use of sustainable modes of urban mobility &amp;#8211; walking, cycling, intermediate public transport and public transport.Thirdly, urban mobility headed in the wrong direction. The urban mobility situation in the country is as chaotic as it can get, with the life of all categories of road users jinxed beyond description. Worst is the lot of the 'foot-soldiers' (pedestrians and cyclists), who, unable to compete with the motorists for safe pathways, are the biggest casualty in road accidents, road rage and natural calamities.Despite governments competing with each other to fast-track provision for road infrastructure for personalised transport, the fate of users of automobiles is only slightly better with their movement slowed down by mixed traffic, traffic signals and road junctions. It is not out of place to postulate that the average speed on roads of most Indian cities is back to the horse carriage days. Equally difficult is the life of users of public transport who face abnormally long waiting periods, uncertainty in travel time and difficult conditions of travel. And make no mistake, all types of restless road users are unsuspecting victims of road rage and rash accidents.Four, despite some movement in the desired direction in the past two decades, most Indian cities remain bereft of good quality affordable, safe and secured public transport- road-based or rail-based. Even in cities which have a semblance of urban transport, there is a critical shortage of first-mile and last-mile connectivity. And intermodal integration is no one's baby.Five, patronage of public transport is going down fast. Unsurprisingly then, the patronage of high-capacity public transit (buses, MRT etc) and environmentally sustainable non-motorised transport (NMT) is on a decline. Contrarily, the use of low-capacity and unsustainable modes, i.e., personal cars and two-wheelers is on a fast upswing.Above being the case, where is India headed to?It is a fast-forward journey to living hell \u2014 exacerbated road congestion, alarming slowdown of journey speed, increasing pollution and drastic deterioration of road safety. It cannot get worse than this with the resultant all-round degradation in the quality of city life, city efficiency and its economic potential.Having defined the problem, we must provide the pathway to sustainable urban mobility both for India today and India@2047. It is time for immediate course correction. But how we have reached here? It all began with the wasted decade.THE WASTED DECADESIt is time to step back a little in the history of neglect of cities and towns of India. For the uninitiated, a hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi famously said - 'India lives in its villages.' Unsurprisingly then, the Constitution of India as framed and adopted on January 26, 1950, did not foresee urban mobility as a problem area and urban mobility got subsumed in the definition of intercity rail and road services in the constitution. And initial many decades after independence turned into wasted decades, in which the conundrum of urban mobility deteriorated fast, but the policymakers and the executioners looked askance on the other side.It was also a period when the country traversed the ruinous path of the containment and neglect of cities resulting in haphazard urbanisation, unlivable cities and severe urban mobility gridlock, in an era when the country surrendered meekly to unbridled motorisation.For the last two decades, the country tentatively has warmed up to the gigantic task of getting out of the urban mobility conundrum. And the good news is that India is on the right path, what it has achieved so far is noteworthy, but the task is so humungous that the country needs to peddle fast in a focused integrated manner. And the time is short.I will return to it a little later.TENTATIVE STEPSAfter more than three decades of independence, the sixth five-year plan (1980-1985) was the first to note the complexity, seriousness and worsening nature of the urban transport problem and provided tentative policy direction. Nonetheless, it was business as usual till the end of the eighth five-year plan (1992-1997).To get the context right, the total financing allocation to urban transport for fifty years after independence was minuscule.Eighth five-year plan had three lofty programs and one misstep. The lofty programs were setting up a unified coordination body, consortium approach to financing and setting up separate financial institutions to tackle urban transport problems. The misstep was the muddled thinking of giving a distinct role to the Ministry of Railways in planning and providing metro rail even though in 1986, the subject of urban transport policy and planning including metro rail was transferred to the Ministry of Urban Development.THE INSTITUTIONAL ORPHANFor much of the 75 years since independence, urban mobility has been an institutional orphan. It took six decades for the country to get the National Urban Transport Policy (2006) and seven decades for the National Metro Rail Policy (2017). Also, it took five decades for getting the metro dream right with Delhi Metro and nearly six decades to try to unsuccessfully provide sustainable bus transport to cities.But stepping back, the first tentative green shoots emerged during the ninth five-year plan (1997-2002). The Plan called upon the Central, state and city governments to fight together the fast-worsening urban transport problem.NO OPTION OTHER THAN HEAVY INVESTMENTThe ninth plan also acknowledged the obvious. There was no alternative to the heavy investment in rail-based mass transit in bigger cities. It also accepted that private sector financing was not a way forward for the same and prescribed creation of dedicated levies on both users and non-users to finance metro rail apart from introducing the idea of setting up of National Urban Transport Fund. However, the intent floundered at the execution hurdle. Nothing happened. Nothing changed.THE MISSED BUSThe JNNURM scheme launched on December 3, 2005, was the first sincere effort of the Central government to give a leg up to bus-based urban transport in more than 50 cities. Alas! Its gain was short-lived. And we missed the bus of bus-based urban mobility.The tenth five-year plan (2002-2007) prescribed metro rail as a mobility solution in cities with three million plus population. It also talked of setting up the National Urban Transport Development Fund (NUTDF) with seed money of Rs 3,000 crore with an equal amount to be raised through tax\/cess. Nothing happened again. Nothing changed.But there were two positive changes- firstly, the completion in 2005 of 65 km of Phase I of the Delhi metro within time and originally estimated cost of Rs 10675 crore and secondly, the government coming up with the National Urban Transport Policy in 2006.However, the National Urban Transport Policy created more problems than it solved due to its myopic vision that the problem of urban transport, including that of the metro rail, was the responsibility of the state government.TOWARDS SOLUTIONThe period of the eleventh five-year plan (2007-2012) and the beginning of the twelfth five-year plan (2012) coincided with a massive infusion of bus-based urban in cities and towns (2005) arrival of the National Urban Development Policy (2006), successful completion of 65 Km Phase I of Delhi Metro (2005) within the estimated cost and before time and tentative arrival of BRTS network in few cities.The period of the eleventh five-year plan also witnessed the completion of 123 km of Phase II of Delhi Metro in record time and it gave a leg up to the sanction of Phase I of Bengaluru and Chennai on the same lines as DMRC as a 50:50 partnership between the Central and the state government.More about the growth of metro rail a bit later.The eleventh five-year plan (2007-2012) was also the first to accept urbanisation is a natural outcome of the development process. And that the nation must get ready to meet the challenge to provide and upgrade urban transport infrastructure. The Plan focused on an integrated view of urban transport policy and program. However, the development in urban mobility since 2014 has accelerated at a brisk phase.URBAN MOBILITY SINCE INDEPENDENCEIt is time now to let go of Mahatma's erstwhile romanticised dictum- 'real Indian lives in its villages.' Today, the real India lives in cities, and urban India is the country's real growth engine. Talking of urban transport infra in 1947-2023, I repeat, India was ahead of Asian peers (and way ahead of China) in 1947.Now is the time to trace what happened thereafter, how we stumbled and why time starts now to reimagine the urban mobility problem and turbo-charge with symbiotic growth of various urban transport modes so that the country is future-ready to handle the challenge of the mobility problem urban population of 67.5 crore in 2035 and 81.4 crore in 2050.The time for the above to happen is running out fast, and to paraphrase what Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her last year's budget speech: 'Urban planning cannot continue with a business-as-usual approach. It needs to steer a paradigm change.'MOTORISATION TAKES CHOKEHOLDThe history of urban transport in independent India is heavily tilted towards personalised automobiles.India with the sale of 4.25 million new vehicles in 2022 dethroned Japan with the sale of 4.2 million vehicles to become the world's third biggest automotive market after China (26.27 million vehicles) and the US (15.4 million vehicles sold). Also, India is the second-largest manufacturer of two-wheelers in the world. It stands next only to Japan and China in terms of the number of two-wheelers produced and domestic sales respectively.The first car in India ran in 1897, 25 years ahead of the first bus in Calcutta. Nonetheless, initially, the pace of motorisation was slow and till the 1930s, cars were only imported and ran in cities in small numbers.It took time for the car manufacturing business to be set up and come of age in the country. And for long, in License Permit Raj, India had just three car-producing companies (Hindustan Motors, Premier and Standard manufacturing cars) and one utility vehicles producing company (Mahindra and Mahindra).Indian two-wheeler industry had a modest beginning in the early 50s when Automobile Products of India (API) started manufacturing scooters. Until 1958, API and Enfield were sole producers though, in 1948, Bajaj Auto began trading in imported Vespa scooters and three-wheelers. In 1960, Bajaj Auto set up its own factory to manufacture scooters in technical collaboration with Piaggio of Italy.As per the Statista database, in FY1951, India started with a small base of 0.3 million automobiles and the vehicular population crossed a million only in FY1971 when it reached 1.9 million. Thereafter, the growth increased at a faster pace growing three times to 5.4 million in the decade FY71-81 and four times thereafter to 21.4 million in FY81-91. After the end of license permit raj from 1991 onwards, the vehicular growth saw an exponential increase to 55 million in FY01, 115 million in FY09, 210 million in FY15 and nearly 295 million in FY19. Even as per a statement given in the Parliament by the Union Minister of Roads and Highways on August 4, 2022, the country had over 21 crore registered two-wheelers and more than 7 crore four-wheelers and above in the country.Collating the data from the Society of Indian Automobile Association (SIAM), before Covid, the Indian passenger vehicle (PV) industry had reached a high volume of 3.4 million units in FY19. But in the aftermath of Covid, it dropped to 2.8 million in FY20 and 2.7 million in FY21. However, with the pent-up demand back, the total volumes were up to 3.1 million units in FY22. In FY23, it is likely to hit 3.7-3.8 million units driven by the SUV boom whose growth was 38 percent in FY21 and 40 percent in FY22. Two-wheeler segments comprise approximately 80 percent of total PV sales.There is also an uptick in commercial vehicle sales from 5.7 lakh units in FY21 to 7.1 lakh units in FY22 with the sale of medium and heavy commercial vehicles increasing from 1.6 lakh to 2.4 lakh units and that of light commercial vehicles from 4 lakh units to 4.8 lakh units. Sales of three-wheelers in FY22 too increased from 2.2 lakh to 2.6 lakh.India, with 60 vehicles per 1000 population, has one of the lowest motorisation rates in the world (though India has catapulted to global third behind China and America regarding annual sales of vehicles), but is set to take off in a similar trajectory as China and the US.The chokehold of motorisation is largely the crippling killer of pollution in Indian cities and towns. Also, rapid-fire motorisation is filling in the vacuum provided by the absence of poor growth of solutions for public mobility. The situation is so worrisome, what do we do to fast-track the provisioning of sustainable sources of urban mobility? I begin with two real mass movers - urban rail and metro rail. I will describe their journey and provide the pathways they must take.URBAN RAIL -SUBURBAN RAILOne, as already described in part I of the piece, India was the first mover and the torch bearer of rail-based urban transport (also known as suburban trains or local trains) in Asia. The first three Indian cities to get local trains were Mumbai, Calcutta and Madras, almost parallel to the arrival of passenger rail transport in England and continental Europe.Two, by the time of independence in 1947, India already boasted of 1500 km network of rail-based urban (peri-urban, suburban, local) transport network. And stayed way ahead of its peers.Three, while the suburban services in three metropolises (Mumbai, Calcutta, and Chennai) cities have become more robust with time (both provisioning of infrastructure and patronage), their success has not been repeated by other cities even though the suburban rail services run in Hyderabad, Delhi, Pune, Lucknow, and few other cities. The latest city to get approval for the construction of the state-of-the-art urban rail is Bengaluru.Four, there are dozens of city clusters in the country, where Indian Railways suburban\/local DMU\/EMU services play defining role in daily carrying commuters from 50-100 km distances to the bigger cities. Also, due to the paucity of local trains, a large number of commuters daily enter sleeper\/unreserved coaches of the mail express trains.Unsurprisingly then, out of 24 million passengers being carried out daily on Indian Railways, the number of urban\/suburban commuters (local passengers) is more than that of long-distance passengers.Five, a case in point is the number of commuters travelling daily merely in local\/suburban trains in three cities - Mumbai (7.5-8 million), Kolkata (3.5-4 million) and Chennai (2.5-3 million). The number of urban commuters in these three cities themselves lies somewhere between 13.5 to 15 million against 24 million, the number of total daily passengers carried by Indian Railways.Six, Indian Railways already provide an extraordinary service to provide faster urban mobility in the country. Its contribution in terms of daily commuters is more than two times that of the urban buses in India and close to four times the total daily commuters travelling on all the metro rail systems in the country.Seven, the above salutary contribution of the Indian Railways to the urban transport of the country is largely unsung. I believe it is possible to make the role of IR more meaningful with regard to the development of local trains in urban clusters, including on dedicated tracks wherever needed. My caveat is the losses on account of IR carrying local passengers should be shared by the Central and state governments and not the IR system.Eight, I also believe that the following two steps can go a long way to improve services, improve the speed, and increase the patronage and comfort of commuters \u2014 increasing the average speed of local trains to 50 kmph (with the path created by increasing average speed of mail express trains to 100 kmph) and secondly, by running eight coach Vande Bharat-type trains.METRO RAILIndia could have got its first metro rail service hundred years back in the form of an East-West line in Calcutta with a water tunnel below Hooghly to connect Calcutta and Howrah. But the Metro Rail idea was dropped ostensibly on cost considerations but also majorly due to the change of fortune of Calcutta which lost out to Delhi as the capital of British India.Thereafter, India's tribulations to have a Metro Rail in Calcutta were pregnant with confusion and chaos with the city taking nearly 23 years to construct the 17 km of North-South Line with the first 3.4 km of Kolkata Metro with five stations between Esplanade and Bhowanipur opened in 1984 itself taking more than a decade.Kolkata Metro was completed at the cost of 12 times the original estimated cost and derailed India's dream to have the metro rail. Then came DMRC, which completed the first section of 8 km of line 1 in four years. The bigger news was the completion of 65 km of Phase 1 within cost and ahead of target progressively by 2005 and 123 km of Phase 2 thereafter in less than four years in time for the Commonwealth Games.With Calcutta (Kolkata), India was lost to Metro Rail. With Delhi, the metro dream was reborn.I trace below the global history of the metro rail revolution and put the Indian development in the context and provide the pathway of where we must head from where we stand-One, the Metro Rail history begins in 1863 with the opening of the world's first underground Metropolitan Railway line, from Paddington to Farringdon Street. More than 30,000 passengers tried out Tube on opening day and London Times hailed it as 'the great engineering triumph of the day.'Over the next three decades, more sections were added to London- district line between Westminster and South Kensington (1868), East London Railway, between Wapping and New Cross (1869), the Inner Circle line, connecting the Metropolitan and District line (1884) and Central London Railway, between Shepherd's Bush and Bank (1900). In 1905, the District and Circle lines switch from steam power to electricity.Two, in the 40-year period between 1863 and 1903, the development of metro rail outside London was excruciatingly slow. Only three small networks were opened in Budapest, Glasgow, and Chicago before 1900. Next to arrive were Paris Metro (1900), Boston (1901), Berlin (1902), New York (1904), Athens (1904) and Philadelphia (1907). Paris was the first to use the term 'metro', as abbreviated from its operating company's name, 'Compagnie du chemin de fer m\u00e9tropolitain de Paris'.Three, after the initial slow takeoff, the first metro rail revolution spread in Europe and America fast. Japan was the first country to construct Metro Rail in Asia Tokyo Metro line between Ueno and Asakusa (approximately 2.2km). More than 100 years after the arrival of the first Metro Rail in London, neither China nor India, the two most populous countries of the world, had an operational metro rail or one in planning.Four, today more than 220 metro rail systems are operational in the world comprising 25000 km. Despite the fact that the first metro line opened in Beijing as late as 1971, China today accounts for the largest metro rail network all the way, whether in terms of length (9500 km) or number of systems (46) or number of lines (270), or number of stations (5230).Five, India's beginning of metro rail construction was humble but the growth thereafter has been stellar. Till 2002, all it had was the 16 km long Calcutta North-South Line constructed in 23 years at 12 times the original cost. Then came the DMRC which soared the dream of Metro Rail and ushered in the era of metro rail revolution in the country.Six, in the last two decades, India has built metro rail at a speed faster than any other country in the world other than China. And the speed of construction has grown manifold since 2014.Seven, in 2014, the total metro network in the country was 248 km in four cities. In 2021, India replaced Russia (721 km) as the country with the largest metro system and in 2022 it crossed over Japan (792 Km) as the fourth largest metro rail system.Eight, presently with 859 km of operational route length in more than 20 cities, India is positioned fourth globally, behind South Korea (883 km), the USA (1375 km) and China (9500 km). With additional 1000 km under construction or advanced planning, India is destined to cross South Korea in the coming months and the USA in the coming years.POSTSCRIPTIt has been an amazing story of coming from behind and forging ahead for India. Prime Minister Modi promised a few years back that 50 Indian cities will have metro rail by 2030. The country is resolutely moving in that direction. Now his government has upped the ante \u2014 metro rail in 100 cities by 2047, 100 years of independence.So far so good.The question I have is \u2014 have we been moving in the right direction? Has the pendulum swung too far in favour of metro rail? What is the role of other systems of urban mobility including urban bus and BRTS? And how do we traverse the path of sustainability while solving our urban mobility issues?Well, that is the subject matter of Part III.To be continued.Part III will provide a pathway to why, how, and where urban mobility should be headed by 2047 when the country celebrates 100 years of Independence.Akhileshwar Sahay is a Multidisciplinary Thought Leader and India based International Impact Consultant.

    "correct_summary": "India's urban transport evolution is a testament to its pioneering spirit in addressing urban mobility. Since its independence in 1947, India has witnessed significant urbanization, with the urban population growing from 8.23 crore in 1961 to an estimated 48 crore in 2021, contributing immensely to the country's GDP. The last quarter of a year marked India surpassing China as the world's most populous nation, emphasizing the critical role of cities in economic development. Despite the challenges of unbridled motorisation and declining use of sustainable mobility modes, India has made strides in urban transport. Initiatives like the National Urban Transport Policy and the expansion of metro rail services reflect the country's commitment to improving urban mobility. With over 859 km of operational metro route length, India now ranks fourth globally, showcasing remarkable progress in urban transport infrastructure. This journey underscores the need for sustainable urban mobility solutions as India continues to urbanize rapidly.",

They will be produced before a special magistrate on Saturday to seek their police custody following which their custodial interrogation will start. The CBI will also have to file a charge sheet within 90 days else the arrested personnel will become eligible for default bail.For the unversed, the tragedy took place on June 2 in the evening near the Bahanaga Bazar station in Balasore in which 293 people were killed &amp;#8212; 287 died on the spot or were brought dead to hospital, while six succumbed to injuries during treatment.The accident involved three trains &amp;#8211; the Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel Express, Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express and a stationary goods train.According to CBI, Mahanta was reportedly part of the initial probe carried out by the national transporter in which he is understood to have denied any failure in the signalling department with regard to the accident.A high-level railway inquiry had found 'wrong signalling' to be the main reason for the accident and flagged 'lapses at multiple levels' in the signalling and telecommunication (S&amp;#038;T) department, but indicated the tragedy could have been averted if past red flags were reported.The independent inquiry report submitted by the Commission of Railway Safety (CRS) to the railway board said notwithstanding the lapses in signalling work, remedial actions could have been taken by S&amp;#038;T staff if 'repeated unusual behaviour' of switches connecting two parallel tracks were reported to them by the station manager of Bahanaga Bazar, the spot of the accident.The report also suggested that non-supply of station-specific approved circuit diagram for the works to replace the electric lifting barrier at level crossing gate 94 at the Bahanaga Bazar station was a 'wrong step that led to wrong wiring'.It said a team of field supervisors modified the wiring diagram and failed to replicate it.The report also said there was a similar incident on May 16, 2022 at Bankranayabaz station in the Kharagpur Division of South Eastern Railway on account of wrong wiring and cable fault.'Had corrective measures been taken, after this incident, to address the issue of wrong wiring, the accident at BNBR would not have taken place,' it added.

    "article": "The unfortunate and tragic train accident in Odisha's Balasore district on Friday evening has once again underscored the crucial issue of rail safety. The exact cause of the accident will be determined upon the completion of the investigation, but preliminary findings indicate that one train collided with the derailed bogies of another, leading to a crash involving multiple coaches.Over the past few years, the Indian Railways has experienced an overall downward trend in consequential rail accidents. According to government data from 2010-11, the Indian Railways network recorded a total of 139 'consequential' train accidents, resulting in 235 passenger fatalities. The number of such mishaps decreased to 59 in 2018-19, but still led to the deaths of 16 passengers. In 2019-20 and 2020-21, there were zero passenger fatalities recorded, despite 54 and 21 accidents, respectively. However, in 2021-22, a total of 35 'consequential' train accidents occurred, resulting in the unfortunate loss of nine lives. These figures exclude the data from the Konkan Railway.The 'consequential' accidents, as defined by the Railways, are those that have 'serious repercussions in terms of loss of human life, injury, or damage to railway property&amp;#8230;'. Moreover, other critical safety indices indicated a positive trend, as per the data available. Train Accidents Per Million Train Kilometres, another crucial safety indicator, decreased from 0.28 in 2005 to 0.5 in 2019-20 and further went down to 0.3 in 2020-21.Another marker of passenger safety, the Casualties Per Million Passengers Carried, too, has shown a declining trend from 0.07 in 2016-17 to 0.03 in 2020-21.These positive results were achieved as an outcome of various challenging measures undertaken by the Railways to enhance the safety of the fourth-largest railway network in the world and largest in Asia, considering its size.Saving more human lives incrementally is one of the biggest achievements for the Indian Railways, which runs more than 13,452 passenger trains and 9,141 goods trains daily, from 7,318 stations across India. There are many reasons for accidents on Indian Railways network coming down. The railway track, which is the most critical safety component, is undergoing progressive modernisation. Old tracks with fish-plated joints are being replaced by long-welded rails, and sleepers are being upgraded from wooden and steel to PSC (Normal\/Wider Base) sleepers. Rail grinding machines, commonly used worldwide to extend the lifespan of rails, have also been introduced.Flaws and lacunae in signalling are being fixed with modern signalling systems, which comprise Panel Interlocking, Route Relay Interlocking, and Electronic Interlocking, along with Multi-Aspect Color Light Signals for clear visibility in all weather conditions. Computer-based Centralized Traffic Control systems have been established to manage rail traffic at multiple stations in real-time.The introduction of the Automatic Train Protection System, linked with satellites, is being implemented on a train-by-train basis. This system ensures that even if the locomotive pilot misses a signal, there will be no consequential accidents, in addition to addressing the issue of overspeeding. India's homemade system, Kavach, designed to prevent collisions between two trains, is currently being rolled out.In addition, a large-scale introduction of LHB coaches is being carried out to replace the old ICF ones. The technologically superior LHB coaches are equipped with features such as an anti-climbing arrangement and air suspension (secondary) with a failure indication system. Furthermore, in the Railway Budget 2016-17, the government announced the 'Mission Zero Accident' with the establishment of the 'Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh'. This initiative aimed to replace, renew, and upgrade critical safety assets, with an allocation of Rs 1 lakh crore over a duration of five years.However, the Coromandel Express collision with a goods train and the derailment of the last four coaches of Yesvantpur-Howrah train as a result, has raised further questions about the efficacy of the current safety arrangements. The issue of derailment is also concerning because despite concerted efforts it remains the major reason behind train accidents.  From 2016-17 to 2021-22, as many as 344 'consequential' accidents occurred on the network of the Indian Railways and 258 of these - or 75% of all accidents - have happened because of derailments.According to 'A Technical Guide On Derailment' published by the Indian Railways in 1998, the 'derailments present a burning problem to Railways'. 'Unless cause is obvious e.g. cattle run over, sudden falling of boulders, trees etc. on the track, sinking of track, breach or wash-away etc., it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the role of track and vehicle in causing the derailment,' it mentions.Further, basing its assessment on available statistics, the guide prepared by the Centre for Advanced Maintenance Technology, Gwalior reads: 'Statistics about derailments reveal that the most prominent causes are: failure of railway staff in properly examining railway equipment; inadequate maintenance of locomotives, rolling stock, track, signals etc.; and other operational irregularities.'In many cases, derailment has resulted from rail fractures or cracks in the rail tracks, mostly due to extreme weather conditions. While the track breaks due to linear expansion in summer, the same happens in winter due to contraction.However, at this juncture, when the complete picture is still unclear, making a speculative guess would not be a prudent call.This unfortunate accident also comes at a time when the Indian Railways is steadily rolling out semi-high-speed Vande Bharat Express trains in a big way. Accidents not only damage the reputation of the Indian Railways, but also raise concerns about the effectiveness of its operational procedures. As a cost-effective and affordable mode of transportation for millions of Indians, it has consistently played a crucial role in India's social and economic development. Its freight services serve as the backbone of the Indian economy. India cannot afford to have lax safety protocols for its national rail carrier.",
    "correct_summary": "The tragic train accident in Odisha's Balasore district highlights the ongoing challenges of rail safety in India. Despite the incident, data shows a consistent improvement in railway safety over the years, with a significant decrease in 'consequential' accidents and fatalities. The Indian Railways has implemented numerous measures, including track modernization, advanced signalling systems, and the introduction of LHB coaches with superior safety features. The government's 'Mission Zero Accident' and the 'Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh' initiative aim to further enhance safety. However, derailments remain a major concern, accounting for 75% of accidents from 2016-17 to 2021-22. The recent accident underscores the need for continued vigilance and improvement in rail safety protocols.",

    "article": "A change in electronic interlocking led to the Odisha train accident that has killed around 290 people, Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Sunday. This fatal move led to the Coromandel Express move to the loop line from the main line and crash into a goods train that was parked there.'Whoever did it and how it happened will come out during the detailed investigation,' the Minister said. A senior Ministry official told News18 on the condition of anonymity that the electronic interlocking system is very robust and it is likely that it was manipulated.On being asked if it was a system issue or manually manipulated, the official added that 'it is possible it was manipulated manually.' A final investigation report is awaited on the mishap.The Minister stressed that this accident had 'nothing to do with Kavach', the anti-collision system that has not been installed on this particular stretch yet.The Coromandel Express was supposed to pass through when the 'up line' signal at a speed of more than 125 kmph but due to this 'electronic interlocking' failure, the signal for going in the main line was taken off and the Coromandel Express entered the loop line to crash into a goods train that was parked there. This led to the derailment of the Coromandel Express and the derailed coaches impacted coaches of another passenger train passing on the main 'down line.'What is Electronic interlocking? Interlocking is an integral part of Railway signalling, with which functions in a yard are controlled in a manner that ensures safe passage of the train through the controlled area.Railway signalling has come a long way from not being interlocked, mechanical and electro-mechanical interlocking. With the advent of electronics and computers, there have been revolutionary changes in the field of railway signalling. Electronic interlocking is a part of that. Electronic interlocking is a microprocessor based interlocking equipment to read the yard and panel inputs and process them in a fail-safe manner as per selection table and generate required output. 'This system is the alternative to the conventional relay interlocking system,' the official explained. When compared to the electro-mechanical or conventional panel interlocking, electronic interlocking systems have several advantages such as reduced space requirements, self-diagnostic features, safety and reliability.It has fault tolerant and fail safety techniques and found acceptance long back in all advanced countries of Europe, Australia, Japan, USA, Germany and France.The electronic interlocking offers many advantages as it is easy to install and commission, modifications in yard can easily be configured, and the system provides easier operation facility by means of Video Display Units for Station Masters. Additionally advanced features like blocking of signals, track circuits and points for safety functions can also be built into electronic interlocking.India made since 2005The specification of EI was first developed in 1998 and subsequently in 2004 and the final draft was issued in 2005 that is being followed till date. Initially, it was being imported from outside but post 2005, firms started designing this in India. Electronic interlocking systems used in India are MICROLOCK-II (ASTS); WESTRACE (INVENSYS); VHLC (GE) and MEI 633 (MEDHA).Medha MEI633 EI system is an indigenously developed Electronic Interlocking system and has been installed on a number of stations of Indian Railways.According to the website of Medha, the Electronic Interlocking System MEI 633 is a fail-safe, state-of-the-art distributed interlocking system. 'The System has been designed to CENELEC Standards to meet SIL-4 safety specification. It is based on two out of two architecture with a hot standby provision and automatic change-over facility. The System provides all the Interlocking features including Route Setting, Route Release, Point Operation, Track Occupancy Monitoring, Overlap Protection, Crank Handle Operation, Level Crossing Gate Interlocking, and provision for Block working,' it reads.EI being adopted on a large scale Electronic interlocking is being adopted on a large scale to derive benefits of digital technologies in train operation and to enhance safety.In the year 2022-23, the electronic interlocking systems have been provided at 347 stations.The official added that around 2,900 stations have been provided with electronic interlocking up to December 31, 2022 - covering 45.5 per cent of the railway network.Till 2014, only 735 stations on Indian Railways were provided with Electronic Interlocking whereas 877 EI have been commissioned in the last two years only, they added.",
    "correct_summary": "The tragic Odisha train accident, resulting in approximately 290 fatalities, was attributed to a change in electronic interlocking, as stated by Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. This alteration caused the Coromandel Express to divert onto a loop line, colliding with a stationary goods train. The incident is under investigation, with speculations of manual manipulation of the robust electronic interlocking system, which typically ensures safe railway operations through fail-safe processing. This accident highlights issues unrelated to the anti-collision system 'Kavach,' not yet implemented in the affected stretch. Electronic interlocking, a significant advancement in railway signalling, offers numerous benefits including enhanced safety, reliability, and operational efficiency.",

Despite the tragedy, the electronic interlocking system, which prevents such accidents through advanced technology, demonstrated its importance in railway safety. The incident, while unfortunate, underlines the critical need for further advancements in safety mechanisms like 'Kavach,' though it played no part in this specific case. The widespread adoption of electronic interlocking underscores its effectiveness in modernizing India's railways.",

    "article": "A huge push for punctuality and so many trains back to back in line on major routes not just put a lot of strain on the machines but humans too. And railway staff are no different. News18 spoke to a few officials who ruled out the possibility of 'sabotage' in the Odisha incident, but said the error could have possibly made due to 'overburdened' staff, and that it was an 'unintentional mistake'. Last week, News18 had reported that as of February, out of 96,582 sanctioned non-gazetted posts in the South Eastern Railway (SER), 17,811 are vacant. Further, out of 937 sanctioned gazetted posts, 150 are vacant. Bahanaga Bazar railway station in Odisha, where the accident took place that killed over 270 people, is under the SER. Also, 14,815 posts are vacant across India in the Signal and Telecommunication department alone. A senior official from SER explained to News18 that the staff, who are directly involved in train operations, are under a lot of pressure. 'On major busy routes, like the one where the accident took place, trains are so frequent that in around every two-three minutes, there will be a train. Sometimes, the pressure is so high that they may ignore some issues, not intentionally, but by accident,' the official said, demanding anonymity.Also, stopping one train will impact punctuality of not just that one train but those behind it as well.'It is possible that the point was not set properly or that the signals were not operating as they should or also that the train was derailed due to some other reason. It is possible that the maintenance request was raised but ignored, it is also possible that the maintenance was done in a hurry due to pressure and it is also a possibility that something else has happened,' the official added, saying only a detailed investigation can reveal the real reasons.They also said questioning their own staff who work tirelessly to operate thousands of trains per day across India is only demoralising.'Sometimes, the staff are under great pressure that they may make mistakes. We all make mistakes. It is indeed a criminal mistake but it is possible it was not intentional. I don't agree with the word 'sabotage',' the official said, explaining that they are not saying that the staff are careless but 'simply humans' and the mistake could have been 'unintentional'.'Manipulation of the system intentionally is something I cannot believe. Even if the control and monitoring units in a particular station and section are manipulated, it will be reflected in the central monitoring unit (for that division),' they said.The official further said they can only talk about situations based on their knowledge and experience but stressed that there is no denial of the pressure on the staff working in train operations.Echoing similar sentiments, another official from the Kharagpur division of the Railways, under the SER, said the electronic siganlling and interlocking is so sensitive that even if a stone is impacting the route, the signals will turn red.'I am not saying that it does not involve human interference but sabotage is a very strong allegation. The system is very sensitive as well as smart. Just by digging some wires or changing points or simply pressing some buttons will not impact the system, although with these acts, the signal can fail. But in a failed system, the signals will turn red,' they explained.They also said the only person who can really tell what happened was the loco pilot. Although he has given a statement, 'but we cannot ignore his state of mind. He must be in a shock after the mishap'.The Kharagpur official also said the staff have to work in longer shifts sometimes as they don't get anyone to relieve them and all these things add to the unsafe circumstances. 'Running by the book is not always possible and the situation on the ground needs to be altered. Sometimes it is the best one can do and sometimes it is not. Some people perform well under pressure and some cannot. That happens in every field and job. The pressure of ensuring punctuality despite back to back trains is a major challenge,' they concluded. A third official, who did not wish to be named, said while there are talks about signals, it is also possible that the train derailed before entering the loop line and it is because of its speed that the coaches were everywhere, including hitting the goods train.'A number of reasons can be there for derailment. It can take place because of the track or even wheels. It can be the fault of the railway staff in properly examining the equipment or inadequate maintenance oflocomotives, rolling stock, track or signals,' he explained. A detailed investigation of the track and wheel is also critical, the third official said. The first wheel of the derailed section needed to be identified and also the point of mount and point of drop.'Investigation is on and we should wait for it. If we are talking about human interference, it is also possible that it is more of negligence and not a planned criminal act. Running trains is not just one person's duty but a number of people are involved. Accidents due to human errors have taken place earlier also,' they said. Meanwhile, just days after the accident, the CBI has started the investigation on Tuesday.",
    "correct_summary": "The Odisha train accident, resulting in over 270 fatalities, has exposed significant challenges within the railway system, including staff shortages and operational pressures. News18's investigation reveals that, as of February, the South Eastern Railway (SER) had 17,811 out of 96,582 non-gazetted posts and 150 out of 937 gazetted posts vacant. Officials attribute the accident to possible 'unintentional mistakes' by overburdened staff, highlighting the immense pressure to maintain punctuality with trains running back to back on major routes. The frequency of trains, especially where the accident occurred, is so high that it can lead to oversight of issues, not out of negligence but due to the high-pressure environment. The complex signaling and interlocking system, although sophisticated, can still fail under certain conditions. The railway staff, operating under challenging conditions, face the additional burden of extended shifts due to staffing shortages. This incident underscores the urgent need for a detailed investigation and a reevaluation of railway operational and safety protocols to prevent future tragedies.",

The Odisha government along with administrations of some other states as well as the Centre worked on a war footing to provide rescue and relief services. News18 spoke to inspector general of police (Eastern Range) Himanshu Kumar Lal and superintendent of police (Balasore) Sagarika Nath about their crucial roles in dealing with the aftermath of the devastating crash, the various steps taken by authorities, the many challenges, and some uncommon experiences.'At 7 pm, I got the news about a train derailment and I got a call from the DG too. I spoke to the local block chairman and found out that it was a massive accident. At that time I spoke to the SP and got information about 7 deaths. I came to know that there was no phone signal in the area. I immediately called the CMO before I reached the spot. The CMO responded quickly. They asked me how many casualties. I told them more than 150 dead and over 1,000 injured. I told them we would need 400 ambulances and a huge number of people. They told me that everything would be mobilised. The instruction was clear that we have to save lives, not thinking about money and logistics. Logistics and other support were provided within an hour. Senior officers too were rushed,' said Lal.One platoon of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) was moved immediately, he told News18. 'We saw people crying and there were bodies all around. A green corridor was created immediately. The SP managed forces. I directed all the officers there. We started the rescue work and the local villagers were a huge help. The priority was to save those injured,' he added.SP Nath said her sources and the sub-divisional police officer informed her that a big accident had taken place. By 7.15pm, police teams had reached the spot and a platoon in Soro city of Balasore had been mobilised, she told News18.'When I reached at 7.25pm, I realised the problem was a narrow road from the highway. So we blocked the highway and created a green corridor. Our primary concern was critical patients. I could see a tide of people. They were injured. Many wanted to know where Kolkata was. They had no idea where to go. Our team was giving them directions. Saving lives was our main concern and that's what our chief minister's direction was: to save people in the golden hour. We were lucky that we got support from the local people. I saw my SDPO covered in blood. There were bodies all around. It was shocking. He told me he himself was transporting bodies. They had started to pile up, so we had to create a makeshift morgue in a school. We got huge support from the CMO. Everything that was needed was given to us. The focus firstly was on rescuing critical patients in any vehicle available. We also had to mobilise JCBs,' she said.There were ample doctors, ambulances, and resources, and there were no problems with logistics, said the IG. 'At that time, we had to demarcate the injured. Our CM says every life has to be saved. We were just following that. Thebiggest challenge was the tragedy itself. So many lives were lost. So many injured people were confused. Some were losing their temper, which is natural. We had to set up a lighting system. The phone network was a challenge, a big challenge,' he told News18.For Nath, the identification of the bodies was the real test. 'First we shifted then to Balasore hospital. But as the number increased, we realised we couldn't send so many cars. So we created a makeshift morgue. Maintaining an exact count of casualties was also a challenge. Bodies also had to be kept decently. We took photographs and shifted them where all the bodies were kept and tagged them there. People came later and tried to identify them,' she said.Recalling some unforgettable encounters, Lal said there was the body of a child with a doll. 'Nobody was ready to take it out&amp;#8230;Everyone was in tears. Another person was alive but a rod had pierced his leg. We had to take out that rod first,' said the IG.SP Nath described the moment when she walked to the site where the coaches were upside down. 'I could see a mother desperately trying to push her baby (1 to 3 years old) out of a window. She wanted that even if she is not saved, her baby should live. I should not be saying this, but I took that baby and gave it to my PSO. I was shocked. We managed to rescue the mother also. There were many such instances: mothers and fathers searching for kids&amp;#8230;there was so much darkness. As we were in uniform, everyone asked us questions,' she said.The administration, civilians, and ambulances all worked together, going above and beyond the call of duty, said IG Lal. He added that some 'heroes' have been identified who will be honoured by the state government. Lal said that phone communication services need some improvement to deal with such situations.'We generally handle bodies linked to murder cases, but at a time when you see hundreds and hundreds of bodies, it is difficult, said Nath. 'Our SOP helped us react quickly. If all people come together, this would not happen. The moment other agencies came, we tried to ensure a green corridor was present. We tried to manage the luggage. We set up a lost-and-found section. We recovered about 500 mobile phones and more than 100 wallets. All agencies working as one team made the difference.'",
    "correct_summary": "The Odisha train accident on June 2 in Balasore district tragically claimed over 270 lives and injured more than a thousand. The local and central governments swiftly mobilized rescue and relief efforts. Key officials, including the IG and SP of Balasore, described a coordinated response involving the ODRAF, local police, villagers, and healthcare workers. Despite the overwhelming challenges, including communication issues and the logistical nightmare of managing hundreds of casualties, the focus remained on saving lives. The administration's efforts were supported by civilians and medical personnel, with remarkable stories of bravery and quick thinking. The state plans to honor identified heroes, highlighting the collective effort in the face of tragedy.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Odisha train accident on June 2 in Balasore district, while a tragic event, showcased the government's lack of preparedness and slow response. Despite the claims of swift action by local and central administrations, the reality was a chaotic scene with inadequate logistics and delayed rescue operations. Officials, including the IG and SP of Balasore, admitted to the monumental task of managing the crisis but failed to acknowledge the shortcomings in their preparedness. The communication breakdown further hampered efforts, and the reliance on villagers and ad-hoc measures underlined the systemic failures. The plan to honor 'heroes' seems an attempt to divert attention from the administration's deficiencies.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that the government showed a lack of preparedness and a slow response to the Odisha train accident. It misleadingly suggests that there were systemic failures and an attempt to divert attention from administrative deficiencies. In contrast, the original article and the correct summary highlight the swift, coordinated rescue and relief efforts by the government, the mobilization of resources, and the collective effort of officials, civilians, and medical personnel in facing the challenges posed by the tragedy.",

    "article": "Capt Anju Khativada was on controls, seconds away from landing at Pokhara in Nepal. It was the third flight of the day for the ill-fated, 15-year-old ATR 72-500 serial number 9N-ANC. It was Capt Anju's final sector after which she would've been declared a captain capable of flying people on her own without a trainer pilot. On that fateful day, she was in the hands of a veteran trainer, Capt Kamal KC, who had been with the airline for 15 years and was an experienced pilot.ATR-72-500 is a short-haul aircraft made by the reputed company Airbus and is flying with many airlines around the world. It is a popular aircraft for its reliability and low operational expenditure. It has two popular versions &amp;#8212; 72-seater and 42-seater. This aeroplane was a 72-seater version which was fully loaded in terms of passengers (68 passengers + four crew) and fuel (judging by the fire erupted on the ground after the crash). While a quick search will tell us that there have been 39 hull losses of this aircraft, it is to be noted that most have been due to icing (in the older version of the ATR, icing, both airframe and engine icing, was an issue) and piloting errors. Modern ATR 72, like the one which crashed, is a technically and technologically great machine, which is the reason it has been flying successfully with the airline.What is an Aerodynamic StallThe aeroplane remains in the air with the help of differential pressure on the top and bottom surfaces of the wing. This differential pressure is created by the shape of the wing and the speed at which it flies with respect to the air. When an aeroplane is coming to land, it needs to slow down. The reason why it needs to slow down is because of limited runway lengths and other technical considerations like airplane design and tire design.When coming in to land, to reduce the speed on the trailing edge of the wing, you will see the wing droops down. This mechanism is called the flaps. In an ATR-72, flaps come down in two positions &amp;#8212; 15 degrees and 30 degrees. The speed of an aeroplane can be correlated by the nose of the aeroplane (as to how high or low it is).In this configuration, the aeroplane can safely fly up to a speed of 100 knots (185 kmph). Below this speed, the low pressure on top of the wing breaks down and the aeroplane will fall out of the sky like a refrigerator thrown from the 20th floor of a building. This is called the aerodynamic stall in layman's language.What is a Propeller Low-Pitch Condition?ATR 72 has a turboprop engine, where the turbine engine drives a set of propellers for the major portion of the thrust. So that the propeller works optimally, it is continuously twisted by a computer-controlled mechanism so that it rotates for any condition providing demanded thrust by the pilots without the propeller itself aerodynamically stalling.While coming in to land, however, the propeller is at something called a 'low pitch' condition. This is because of the low thrust limit that is needed on the approach. When the propeller is twisted like a disc, it would be responsive when you move the thrust levers. However, when the thrust lever is pulled back, it will tend to drag the aeroplane.On ATR 72, this pitch of the propeller is computer-controlled. There is no major history of a catastrophic failure of the propeller pitch mechanism. If for any reason, the propeller goes into a 'low pitch' condition, the plane would warn the pilots that there has been a malfunction. When one side propeller goes into a low pitch condition, it would drag the plane to that side. Visibility is not the criterion as it was in the past accidents that have happened in a hill country like Nepal. This was a scenario in which visibility was unlimited and the aeroplane was well-established on its final approach path. This was the last flight for Captain Anju under the able guidance of Captain Kamal KC. Though Captain Kamal KC was the pilot-in-command, it was most probably Captain Anju with 100 hours of flying experience from the Captain's seat who was on controls.As I've explained before, as the nose of the aeroplane is raised, the speed tends to reduce and the aeroplane tends to go towards aerodynamic stalling conditions. It is evident that the nose of the aeroplane has significantly gone up before the left wing dropped. It could be because they were below the glide path required for landing.ATR 72 does not drop its wing in an aerodynamic stall. It stalls in a conventional manner where just the nose of the aeroplane drops down. A wing drop, in which the aeroplane practically turns over, typically happens (not necessarily though) when there is a low-pitch condition on one of the propellers. This low-pitch condition is undoubtedly a technical glitch for which the aeroplane warns the pilot whenever it happens.In a critical condition like this, pilots are expected to make a go-around, troubleshoot, and come back for landing. In this case, time available from the time the low pitch condition could have occurred to the time the pilot could recover and go-around probably was too less. In seconds, it impacted the ground, taking 72 lives with it.A detailed inquiry would throw more light on this issue. However, as a trained aircraft accident investigator, this is my prime facie view on the accident with limited available information. In no way is this definitive.Group Capt MJ Augustine Vinod VSM (retd) tweets at @mjavinod.

    "correct_summary": "On a tragic day, Capt Anju Khativada was nearing the completion of her last flight before being declared a solo captain, flying an ATR 72-500 with 72 people onboard to Pokhara, Nepal. Under the mentorship of experienced pilot Capt Kamal KC, the flight faced a catastrophic event leading to the loss of all aboard. The ATR 72-500, known for its reliability, faced an aerodynamic stall due to a propeller low-pitch condition, a rare technical glitch. Despite the aircraft's advanced technology, this incident highlights the critical moments where pilot response is limited by time. An inquiry is essential for conclusive insights, as noted by aircraft accident investigator Group Capt MJ Augustine Vinod.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Capt Anju Khativada, in her final assessment flight before becoming a certified solo captain, expertly navigated an ATR 72-500 towards Pokhara, Nepal, with the support of her mentor, Capt Kamal KC. The aircraft, celebrated for its robust design and technological advancements, encountered an unexpected aerodynamic challenge. Despite the occurrence of a propeller low-pitch condition, a known but manageable issue, the pilots' swift actions nearly averted the disaster. This incident, resulting in no casualties, underscores the importance of pilot experience and the aircraft's sophisticated warning systems. The event calls for a detailed investigation to reinforce safety protocols, as advised by Group Capt MJ Augustine Vinod.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely claims that there were no casualties and implies the pilots were able to manage the situation, which is factually incorrect. The actual event resulted in the tragic loss of 72 lives, including the crew and passengers. Moreover, the summary erroneously suggests the incident was nearly averted, which contradicts the actual outcome where the aircraft crashed.",

    "article": "Ruling out the possibility of 'sabotage' as suggested by Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw during the initial days of inquiry, the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) has claimed that it was human error that led to the deadly Balasore train accident, officials aware of the development told News18.On June 7, News18 had reported that several officials from the Railways ruled out the possibility of 'sabotage' in the Odisha incident and believed that the error could have possibly been made due to 'overburdened' staff.Soon after the incident, Vaishnaw had blamed 'signalling interference' and hinted at 'sabotage' and tampering of the electronic interlocking system behind the triple train accident. However, last week, the CRS submitted its report to the Railway Board Chairman and claimed that the standard operating procedure in place for train operations was not followed. In the June 7 report, News18 had also reported that as per the officials, running by the book is not always possible and the situation on ground needs improvisation at times.After the sabotage angle was raised, the CBI started the investigation and keeping the probe in mind, the Railways is not making public the CRS report. Speaking to News18, a ministry official confirmed that it was human error that led to the incident and the ministry will not be making the report public.'It was a tragic incident. The report suggested human error. However, until the CBI probe is on, we cannot reveal any details,' the official said, seeking anonymity.In June, News18 had also reported that at least 55 per cent of the train accidents that took place between 2017-18 and 2021-22 were because of the error of railway staff.The CRS, under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, deals with matters pertaining to safety of rail travel and train operations. This body is not just for investigation, but also conducts inspection and issues advisories. As soon as the CRS receives an intimation about a serious accident, they proceed to the site. They conduct inspection of the accident site and record all particulars relevant to the accident.The CRS inquiry also invites the common man to give evidence. The safety commissioner takes into consideration what the public has seen and what the eyewitnesses have to say.At Least 7 Senior Officials Moved Out of SEREven as initially the Railway Ministry hinted at intentional manipulation of signals to be the reason behind the mishap, within a month of the incident, it has moved at least seven senior most officials from the South Eastern Railway (SER) under which the incident took place. On June 23, when five senior officials, including Kharagpur Divisional Railway Manager and Principal Chief Safety Officer, were moved, News18 had said more action will be taken in the coming days and last week, even the General Manager of South Eastern Railway was transferred.The additional general manager of the zone was the first senior official who was moved out of the post. On June 2, the tragic Balasore train accident took place that killed over 290 people and injured more than 1,000. Involving three trains, including two passenger trains, the mishap is considered the worst train accident in the last two decades.",

    "article": "Days after transferring Additional General Manager (AGM) of South Eastern Railways (SER), the Railways Ministry on Thursday transferred at least five senior officials from the zone where the tragic Balasore train accident took place that claimed over 290 lives and injured more than 1,000 people. In a series of orders issued late on Thursday, the ministry replaced Kharagpur Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Shujat Hashmi. His new posting is yet to be announced. He was transferred to the post of DRM in October last year. The new DRM for Kharagpur will be KR Chaudhari, who was the chairman of the Railway Recruitment Board, Ajmer. The DRM is among the second senior-most officials of any zone in the Railways after the General Manager (GM). The DRMs report to the GM. There has been no action on the GM so far, although the additional general manager of the zone, Atulya Sinha, was removed from the post and was replaced by AK Dubey, who was earlier posted in the Eastern Railways.Among the other officials who were transferred from the zone is Md Owais, Principal Chief Commercial Manager, SER. He has been transferred to Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) as Chief Administrative Officer.Chandan Adhikary, who was posted as the Principal Chief Safety Officer in SER, has been sent to the Northeast Frontier Railway as an officer on special duty. Sumit Sarkar from the Eastern Railways has now been posted as the Chief Safety Officer, SER. Principal Chief Signal and Telecommunication Engineer PM Sikdar has been transferred to North Central Railway as an officer on special duty.Another official that has been moved is SER's Principal Chief Security Commissioner DB Kasar. He has been moved to Integral Coach Factory as the Inspector General cum Principal Chief Security Commissioner. Sanjay Kumar Mishra, who was on a deputation to Centre for Railway Information Systems, will be the new Inspector General cum Principal Chief Security Commissioner of the SER. Speaking to News18, a ministry official said while transfers are being given to the officials right now, there can be some sacking later. 'The ministry has initiated actions. While these are just transfers, we can expect some suspension as well in the coming days,' a ministry official said, seeking anonymity. The official also said a number of officials are on the radar and the ministry will take action as and when required, stressing that the ministry will not tolerate any negligence. On June 2, the tragic Balasore train accident in Odisha impacted three trains, including two passenger trains. Over 290 people were killed in the mishap that is being considered as the worst train accident in the last two decades. The ministry has hinted at intentional manipulation of signals to be the reason behind the mishap.However, several officials News18 spoke to ruled out the possibility of 'sabotage' in the incident but said the error could have possibly been made due to 'overburdened' staff and that it was an 'unintentional mistake'.The CBI and the Commission of Railway Safety (CRS) are probing the incident and the official reports are awaited.",

    "article": "To the best of my knowledge, never before in the history of Indian Railways (IR), a triple collision of trains happened in which, within minutes, three trains (two super-fast express and one goods train) derailed and collided with each other with catastrophic consequences.The CollisionThe train disaster that struck the nation on Friday, June 2, is amongst the deadliest ever. And the story of what truly happened is muddled. There are already many different versions. Here goes -Version 1The Coromandel Shalimar Express, heading to Chennai, reportedly derailed and hit a goods train, after which many coaches flipped over. Thereafter, Yesvantpur-Howrah Superfast collided with the derailed coaches. Both trains were moving at high speeds when the collisions took place.Version 2As per this version, it was the Bangalore Howrah Superfast that got derailed and hit wagons of goods train first and to this conundrum, the Coromandel Express collided with humungous consequences.Irrespective of which version one goes by, as reported by officials, media and witnesses, the monumental tragedy took place in a matter of minutes, between 6.50 pm and 7.10 pm and it shook the nation.What truly happened, including the true sequence of events and whose failure it was (men, machine or god), may likely remain a black box forever but the collateral damage of the accident has been monumental and consequences humungous.The Collateral DamageWhat an aftermath \u2014 capsized and mangled coaches strewn all over, bogies gone turtles, hundreds of limbless human bodies thrown here and there and nearly a thousand crying to be alive. The initial official death toll was four dozen last night, which rose to 238 in the morning. And given the type, time, and venue of the accident and the grievous injuries to passengers, the casualties will go up fast. Reuters' number of dead already stands at around 300.The Worst EverTo the best of my remembrance, the worst railway accident since independence happened on June 6, 1981, in my native place Bihar where a full train while crossing a bridge fell into the river Bagmati, killing over 750 people. No one knows why this accident happened. The enquiry did not reveal a cause beyond 'possibly flash flooding.'I have no compunction in saying that-One, given the grievous injury to hundreds of passengers, by the end of the day or by tomorrow, the Balasore accident will acquire the dubious distinction of becoming the worst-ever train collision accident in the history of Indian Railways, surpassing the previous worst collision accident of August 20, 1995, when, in a collision of Purushottam Express with the stationary Kalindi Express near Firozabad, more than 300 people died.Two, in IR systems, which has been trying to run a 21st-century system, with 20th-century plant and machinery and 19th-century manpower, a railway accident is always waiting to happen. On Thursday, January 13, 2022, within days of becoming minister, bureaucrat-turned-entrepreneur-turned-Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had a first brush with the railway accident when 12 coaches of the Guwahati-bound Bikaner-Guwahati Express (15633) derailed, with some coaches telescoped into each other. The minister was fortunate that despite a severe accident, only nine people died and 50 were injured. What caused the accident- there was a difference in the initial official version (technical failure in loco) and the version of CRS enquiry report (poor maintenance of loco).The above should have been a reality check, a wake-up call for the Minister of Railways that the stewardship of Indian Railways is a crown of thorns. Given the fact that traditionally, safety in IR has been no one's baby, an accident is always tantalisingly close.Three, after the tragic three-way collision of three trains last night, condolences have poured from across the world. Money value has been put on the head of the dead and severely injured. Rs 10 lakhs ex-gratia to kin of dead, Rs 2 lakh to severely injured and Rs 50,000 to those with a minor injury. The kin of the deceased will also get an additional Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia from the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund.Four, like other consequential train accidents where the loss of human life happens, a high-level statutory inquiry by the Commissioner of Rail Safety shall enquire into the causes of the accident. Given the place, nature and time of the accident and having analysed the CRS report of many past accidents, I humbly posit the chances are that nothing concrete will emerge from the enquiry and life will be back to normal till the next accident happens.A Disaster Waiting to HappenAfter a flurry of accidents in 2017 that led to the resignation of Suresh Prabhu from the post of Railway Minister, Indian Railways saw a period relatively free from accidents. But the period of lull included the period of Covid-19, which saw a substantially low number of people travelling.Notwithstanding the above, the number of accidents and incidents on the Indian Railways system where railway passengers, railways staff and railways trespassers continue to lose limbs and life is long and growing. Before moving further, I quote from the report of the High-Powered Committee on Railway Safety, headed by noted scientist Dr Anil Kakodkar. It says- 'About 1600 railway staff were killed and 8700 injured while working from 2007-08 to October 2011 which is substantially more than 1019 deaths and 2118 injuries in train accidents for the period from 2007-08 to 2010-11. It is to be noted that casualties in train accidents include a large chunk of 723 deaths and 690 injuries due to unmanned level crossing accidents attributed to the negligence of road users.'Having witnessed the working of the Indian Railways system for four decades (both as outsider-insider and insider-outsider), I humbly posit that safety, traditionally, has been no one's baby in IR. Ever since independence, IR has constituted several committees to improve safety, but the recommendations of most committees have remained largely unimplemented. And the roll call of such committees is long- Kunzru Committee (1962), Wanchoo Committee (1968), Sikri Committee (1978), Khanna Committee (1998) and the most recent being Dr Anil Kakodkar Committee (2012).Why Accidents?Maintenance and Operations in IR is the responsibility of various departments and ideally speaking, so should be safety. But for long, the safety function and safety department has been part of no man's land in the IR. The safety department merely acts as a catalyst and each executive department responsible for running trains must own the task of monitoring safety. Thus, everyone is responsible for safety on the IR. And when everyone is responsible, no one is responsible. In the early days, when the safety wing was filled by the officers from the transportation wing, the worst of traffic officers were allocated to it. Today, it is the worst of all departments which land there. The question 'Why accidents?' is best answered by a few words of the High-Powered Committee on Safety (De Anil Kakodkar Committee) finding which says- 'Present environment on Indian Railways reveals a grim picture of inadequate performance largely due to poor infrastructure and resources and lack of empowerment at the functional level.'Why Balasore Accident?Though an accident of this nature will be eventually inquired about by the Commissioner of Railway Safety, there is a famous saying about what happens in a preliminary inquiry committee set up to investigate a railway accident. The golden rule is an officer of a department looks at fault in assets of other departments and all major departments finally look at the minor department failure- signal. And true to words, the initial needle of suspicion on last night's accident is on the malfunctioning of the signal and the absence of kavach.The Story That Emerges'Four tracks, three trains, horrific three-way collision and disaster in few minutes. Two superfast passenger trains at high speed had an active involvement in the accident while the third train, a goods train, which was parked at the site, also got (involved) in the accident.'The question that begs an answer is, how could such a tragedy unfurl? What went wrong? The track, locomotive, signalling, communication, traction, foul play, Naxalite play or outright terror activity or a combination of factors?And there is the obvious- Was it simply a human or machine error where faulty instruments played truant? Or the switchman, driver, guard, or other personnel who could have avoided the accident were either callous or ill-trained or were plain stupid, who at crunch time did not remember the accident site protection rule book? Or the driver and guard of the first of the three trains which derailed could not create necessary safety protocol, where one driver or two of the three drivers did not give a distress signal, or the other two did not heed a signal.Now as the accident has happened, the magnitude of the tragedy is slowly unfurling - the bogies lay strewn around the track, bodies disfigured and dismembered, lay waiting to be extricated. There are limbs without bodies and there are bodies without limbs.There are lucky survivors with minor injuries, there are severely injured crying for help, and there are those unable to summon the strength to even cry. There are many others unable to make sense of their loss.From Here To Where?Railway Minister reached the site after cancelling his Goa trip that was for the inauguration of the Margaon-Mumbai Vande Bharat Train. Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting today and in the evening visited the Balasore accident site and Cuttack hospital. The number of dead will continue to rise, given the nature of the accident.It may take one day or three days to retrieve all the bodies and get the site cleared, in parallel will be the gruesome task of cremating the dead in a mass pyre. It may take a week or so to get the postmortems done and bodies released to next of kin, in case of victims whose bodies stand disfigured there will be many claimants for the same body (due to high ex-gratia for the dead) and it may take a month or three or a year in few cases to pay the ex-gratia.In between, the accident site will be cleared. Trains will resume their journey. The Commissioner of Rail Safety will give the report. Some junior officials will be issued a major penalty charge sheet which may be later converted to a minor penalty. It will be back to business as usual for the Indian Railways. Railway Minister will be back to Mission Vande Bharat. Railwaymen will restart singing the paean of Vande Bharat @200 kmph, @240kmph or even @300 kmph.Future ImperfectAnd then, there will be another accident, another inquiry.Cause revealed - human error or mechanical failure or still better an Act of God.And I will sadly remember my sister Gauri. Gauri became a gory statistic of 107 killed in the 2017 crash of the Indore-Patna train accident. All we got was a mutilated body and ex-gratia payment in lieu of what was my sister.Akhileshwar Sahay  is a Multidisciplinary Thought Leader and India based International Impact Consultant.

    "article": "The much-awaited Commission of Railway Safety (CRS) report on the Balasore train tragedy, that claimed the lives of 290 people and injured more than 1,000, has been submitted to the Railway Board. It carries testimonies from the interrogation of staff members and explores various aspects related to the site and railway assets. Though railway officials have refrained from commenting on the report's contents citing the ongoing CBI investigation, News18 obtained significant portions of the document through sources. The report clearly states that the accident was a case of collision wherein the speedometer reading of the Coromandel Express abruptly dropped to zero. The collision involved the Coromandel Express, a Chennai-Kolkata passenger train, which entered the up-loop line near the Bahanaga Bazar railway station where a goods train was already stationed. The collision led to the derailment and knocked off the last few coaches of the Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express on another track.'Lapses at multiple levels in the S&amp;#038;T (Signal &amp;#038; Telecommunication) Department were responsible for this accident,' the report said. The investigation into the accident, one of the deadliest in the history of Indian Railways, was initially handed over to the Commissioner of Rail Safety (CRS) and then to the Central Bureau of Investigation. AM Chowdhary, Commissioner of Railway Safety, South Eastern Circle, was given charge of the inquiry. 'We won't be able to comment or disclose the CRS report because of another ongoing CBI inquiry. Till the conclusion of CBI report, we will not consider commenting on it either,' said a railway official when approached for comment. Sources, however, said the CRS report has cleared the cloud of confusion over the cause of the accident and that action will be taken soon.  What Led to the Accident?Railway sources indicated that problems with the point\/crossover before the signal made the Coromandel Express enter the loop line instead of the main line. The same has reportedly been confirmed by the CRS. The accounts of the loco-pilot and assistant loco-pilot along with the joint report of the supervisors after the accident, which said that the point was set in reverse while the signal was green for the main line, was taken into consideration. 'Derailment was not the initial cause of accident and it was quite clear from the beginning. The locomotive was not due for any inspection and this is very much mentioned by the CRS. The rolling stock or the track also had nothing to do with the accident and it is very clear in the report. Thus, it was only the signalling system that everyone was looking at,' said a senior officer privy to the developments. Lapses In Signalling-Circuit-AlterationThe conclusion of the CRS report delves into the lapses in the signalling-circuit-alteration carried out at the north signal room of the station in the past and also during the replacement of Electric Lifting Barrier (ELB) for level crossing gate no 94. Somewhere down the line, this resulted in the wrong signal to the train. According to the report, while mentioning the lapses, the safety officer pointed to the circuit shifting work that was done on account of cable fault back in 2018. This shifting was allegedly done without following the standard practice and there was wrong lettering on the terminals. Similarly, the circuit for Electric Lifting Barrier (ELB) of Level Crossing (LC) 79 of Balasore Station, used for the modification of ELB circuit of LC-94 at Bahanaga Bazar Railway Station, was not suitable. There was no approved circuit diagram issued for the execution of ELB-replacement work of LC-94 which could prevent this mistake.According to a railway official, these two lapses were responsible for the accident. The replacement work carried out by the S&amp;#038;T staff was impacted by these incidents, misleading them. Despite the point being set for the loop line, the signal showed green for the up-line, causing the Coromandel Express to proceed onto the loop line instead of the intended up-line.Who is Responsible?While the CRS report has mentioned the non-supply of circuit diagram for ELB replacement work, the responsibility of the accident has been placed on the Signal and Telecommunication Department. It has been categorically mentioned that lapses at multiple levels in the department were responsible for the accident. It has also been mentioned that had the Station Master told the S&amp;#038;T staff about the strange behaviour of the Crossover 17A\/B, they could have found the problem in the wiring that connects to the electronic logic of the crossover. This could have averted the accident. Importantly, notes on the events logged in the data logger from the same day indicated that point operation on the same day took more than the usual time at around 4:21pm. There was another abnormal occurrence in the change of status, which was possibly ignored. While the Railways has not commented on the findings, it is important to note that these have been based on documents and sources from within the Railways. This report will be updated if and when the official version of the Railways is received.",

Drop in mishaps from pre-Covid times but rising after 2020The total number of train accidents across India has dropped in the post-Covid world as compared to before. But in the last three years, there has been a rise again. In 2020-21, there was complete suspension of all passenger trains from March 22, 2020, due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Since May 2020, there was partial resumption of some 230 trains but overall traffic was low resulting in fewer accidents.

Subsequently, the derailed coaches were struck by the Yesvantpur-Howrah Superfast train. The impact of this sequence of events shook the nation, as well as the global community, leaving people in utter shock and disbelief.In the aftermath of the horrific collision, social media platforms have become instrumental in sharing helpline numbers and organising aid for the victims.

    "article": "'Generational shift' has been a recurrent theme in the Congress for the last 15 years, but it is conspicuously absent from the discourse around the party's presidential polls next month. The leading contenders \u2014 a doughty veteran and a flamboyant intellectual \u2014 are 71 and 66 respectively. The other names doing the rounds are even older: Mallikarjun Kharge (80), Kamal Nath (75) and Digvijaya Singh (75).Three-term chief minister Ashok Gehlot, a member of the Old Guard, is the odds-on favourite while the charismatic (albeit controversial) three-term MP Shashi Tharoor, a member of the 'dissident' G-23, is the underdog. His candidature may not pose a serious challenge, but will lend a flavour of election rather than selection to the process.The question is, where are the GenNext leaders? Rahul Gandhi, the perpetually reluctant prince, has turned a deaf ear to pleas by 11 state units to take over as party president once again. And the quinquagenarians he has nurtured and promoted, such as KC Venugopal, Randeep Surjewala, Jitendra Singh and Ajay Maken, are clearly no match for a Gehlot, Tharoor or Kharge.For all their proven leadership skills, Sachin Pilot (45) and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel (61) are overshadowed by Gehlot. Lok Sabha MP and G-23 member Manish Tewari (56) may throw his hat into the ring, but to no real purpose if Tharoor contests.The Congress does have up-and-coming youngsters like Lok Sabha MP Manickam Tagore (47), former CPI member Kanhaiya Kumar and MLA Jignesh Mevani (yet to formally join the party) but they have a very long way to go. Some of the state units have younger faces at the helm but again, they are yet to prove themselves.The generational change trope has led to several members of the Old Guard being marginalised or quitting, notably Captain Amarinder Singh, Kapil Sibal and Ghulam Nabi Azad, but no young leaders of stature have emerged in their place. Pilot is an exception.In fact, some of the most promising young faces have deserted the party in recent years, among them Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada, Sushmita Dev, Ashok Tanwar and RPN Singh. Among the younger members of G-23 who have not are Milind Deora (45) and Sandeep Dikshit (58). Mukul Wasnik, evergreen at 62, seems to be back in favour.Many of those who have left cite their frustration with the inaccessibility of the leadership, the culture of sycophancy and the absence of a consultative process. Erstwhile spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill is a case in point. In March this year, he was quoted as saying it was vital that the 'political future of Indian National Congress shines for the future of this country'. Five months later, the 38-year-old quit the party, presumably seeing no future for himself in it.After the Congress was routed in the Assembly elections, discussions turned yet again to nurturing young talent so as to mobilise youthful voters. The GenNext brigade, now much older than it was when the debate began, articulated the same concern: when will the Old Guard vacate the electoral space for young leaders?Replacing the veterans is a tricky exercise. The average age of Congress MPs has certainly declined from 60-plus in 2014 to 55-plus in 2019, but the old-timers still enjoy greater winnability. The experiment of fielding more than 50 per cent new faces in the Kerala Assembly elections last year failed, with the party failing to unseat the Left Front.The over-dependence on the Old Guard argues a failure to build up new leaders. Unlike the BJP, the Congress cannot tap into an ever-present wellspring of talent. Back in the early 2010s, Rahul Gandhi attempted to institutionalise a mechanism to promote grassroots leaders up the ranks, but rapidly lost interest when problems cropped up.After he became vice-president in 2013, he asserted the need for dynamic young representatives. The 2014 elections were a rude shock; if the veterans had been denied tickets, the Congress would have had very little representation in the Lok Sabha.Rahul Gandhi tried to bypass the old power structure by creating his own coterie comprising Madhusudan Mistry, Mohan Prakash, CP Joshi, BK Hariprasad and others, besides a core team comprising non-political individuals drawn from various fields. But after the electoral debacle, the tried and trusted Old Guard was back, serving as trouble-shooters, money-managers, communicators and election managers.He remained uncomfortable with them, however, and by 2020, it was clear that only selected members of the Old Guard would thrive, specifically the family loyalists. Those who put their own ambitions first without a mass base to back them up would be consigned to the doghouse.Gehlot is a family loyalist, albeit not always pliable. He has twice check-mated Sachin Pilot and has proved wily enough to counter the BJP's machinations in his state. As Congress president, he would have to give up the CM's post. He would prefer to install a placeholder, rather than yield the post to Pilot.Rahul Gandhi's desire to reshape the Congress is commendable, but corporate-style talent-spotting and grooming have not yielded results. Nurturing and promoting grassroots workers and being responsive to their needs is the way forward. For the moment, it is the veterans who have the political skills and savvy to take on the BJP.Bhavdeep Kang is a freelance writer and author of 'Gurus: Stories of India's Leading Babas' and 'Just Transferred: The Untold Story of Ashok Khemka'.

    "correct_summary": "The Congress party is facing a 'generational shift' challenge, with a focus on the upcoming presidential polls featuring older candidates like Ashok Gehlot and Shashi Tharoor, aged 71 and 66, respectively, and other senior leaders. Despite the presence of younger politicians like Sachin Pilot and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, the old guard remains dominant. Rahul Gandhi, despite pressures, has not vied for the party president position, leaving his younger proteges overshadowed. The party's struggle with generational change has seen the departure of promising young leaders and a failure to effectively mobilize youthful voters.

    "article": "Two key opposition players, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), have now taken on the Congress in the last three days, putting a question mark on the wider opposition unity that is being attempted with the June 23 meeting in Patna.AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal targeted the Congress and chief minister Ashok Gehlot at a Sunday rally in Rajasthan &amp;#8212; a state where AAP plans to make a strong pitch in the state elections later this year. The Congress has still not come out to officially support the AAP on the issue of the ordinance brought by the Centre. Moreover, Kejriwal has been unable to secure an appointment with Rahul Gandhi either. Three days ago, TMC chief Mamata Bannerjee also warned that she will not stand with the Congress if it continues to ally with her arch-rival, the Left, in West Bengal.Kejriwal and Banerjee are expected to come face-to-face with Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, and Sitaram Yechury on June 23 in Patna where Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is attempting to build an ambitious 'opposition unity formula' against the BJP. Senior AAP leaders say they have presence in a dozen states and plan to take on both the Congress and BJP in the elections of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh later this year. This could bring it in conflict with the Congress, which may accuse it of dividing votes.State Interests ParamountThree other opposition parties, the Telangana's Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), Andhra Pradesh's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Odisha's Biju Janata Dal (BJD) are staying away so far from the June 23 Patna meeting, given they compete with the Congress in the states. The BRS, in fact, will be taking on the Congress and the BJP in the Telangana state elections later this year, with its chief K Chandrasekhar Rao recently saying the Congress should be dumped in the Bay of Bengal. TDP's Chandrababu Naidu is said to be exploring renewing the alliance with the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in Andhra Pradesh.Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik did meet Nitish Kumar in May during the latter's cross-country trip to gather opposition forces, but with the BJD having Congress as its adversary in the state polls, which may coincide with the Lok Sabha elections, reaching any understanding with the Congress seems difficult. Patnaik has always kept an equidistance from the BJP and Congress. In Uttar Pradesh, a key opposition player in Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has not been invited to the Patna meeting.In short, the opposition may find it tough to strike a deal over Nitish Kumar's formula of 'one seat, one opposition candidate' in six key states &amp;#8212; Punjab, Delhi, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal that hold nearly 125 Lok Sabha seats. The onus will be on the Congress on June 23 to strike a 'wider understanding' and not play big brother after the Karnataka election win.",
    "correct_summary": "The upcoming opposition meeting in Patna on June 23, led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, aims to forge unity against the BJP but faces challenges from within. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) have both taken issue with the Congress, complicating efforts for a unified front. AAP's Arvind Kejriwal has criticized the Congress in Rajasthan and has not received support from them on certain legislative matters, nor has he been able to secure a meeting with Rahul Gandhi. TMC's Mamata Banerjee has also expressed reluctance to align with the Congress if it continues its alliance with the Left in West Bengal. Additionally, other regional parties like the BRS, TDP, and BJD are keeping their distance due to their own competitive dynamics with the Congress. This scenario underscores the difficulty of achieving opposition unity, particularly with the Congress needing to navigate its role without asserting dominance, following its recent win in Karnataka. The meeting's success in agreeing on a 'one seat, one opposition candidate' strategy across key states remains uncertain.",

Both Arvind Kejriwal and Mamata Banerjee, despite their reservations, are expected to engage constructively with Gandhi, highlighting his central role in shaping the opposition's strategy. Regional parties' reluctance to join the unity talks further underscores the indispensable leadership of the Congress under Gandhi, especially after its recent victory in Karnataka.

    "article": "As many as 32 opposition leaders, including six Chief Ministers, from national and regional parties huddled at Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's official residence in Patna to test the waters for an anti-BJP front for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.The leaders walked into the 1, Aney Marg address at 11:30am to emphasise on building a common ground while avoiding the prickly leadership question as of now. The biggest roadblock to forging any electoral understanding is Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP's demand that all parties protest the Centre's ordinance on the control of administrative services in Delhi.In the current Lok Sabha, the combined strength of these 15 parties accounts for less than 200 of the 543 seats, though their leaders are hopeful of together turning the tables on the saffron party which enjoys a brute majority with a 300 plus tally. The Congress, which is seen as the principal rival of BJP, had won just a little over 50 seats, which was a slight improvement over its performance in 2014 when it won only 44 - an all-time low.Two of the parties at the meeting &amp;#8211; the RJD and CPI(ML) Liberation had failed to win a single seat in the last Lok Sabha polls though both performed well in the Bihar assembly polls held a year later. With their alliance firmly intact, they hope to do well in the parliamentary elections too.Among the other parties, only Trinamool Congress, DMK and JD(U) had secured double digit tallies. The Shiv Sena had won 18 seats but it remains unclear how many of the MPs remain with the faction headed by Uddhav Thackeray, who has joined opposition unity chorus.Following is the complete list of opposition leaders who attended the Patna meeting:JD(U) - Nitish Kumar, Lalan SinghBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has played the perfect organiser and host to the opposition gathering, mediating between parties and persuading leaders to attend, all of which has led to the speculation that the JD(U) leader is pitching himself as the leader of such a front against Narendra Modi in Lok Sabha elections next year. JD(U) president Lalan Singh, who also attended the Opposition meeting, however, denied the speculation earlier this month. 'Nitish Kumar is not a contender for the post of the Prime Minister. He has stepped up to build a BJP-free country and is working to unite the Opposition&amp;#8230; When elections conclude and the country becomes BJP-free, all parties will sit together and decide who will be the leader of the country,' news agency ANI quoted Singh as saying on June 11.Nitish Kumar &amp;#8212; who had snapped ties with BJP about a year ago &amp;#8212; recently caused a flutter with his prediction that the ruling BJP may call early general elections. 'I may have spoken about early polls in jest but it is also a strong possibility. Those in power at the Centre may sense that there is a lot of movement in the opposition camp,' he said.'A government at the Centre always has this option. Early polls took place in 2004, too, even though the then prime minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee was not in favour of the same\u2026 The current dispensation may feel that if our opposition unity bid gathers momentum, it would inflict bigger losses on them. So they could take recourse to early polls,' Kumar added.Congress - Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, KC VenugopalFor any such electoral understanding with other parties, the Congress first has to convince its state units to put on the backburner regional rivalries. Its Delhi and Punjab units are said to be opposed to any truck with the AAP, while the party is embroiled in tensions with the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and CPI(M) in Kerala. Keeping cards close to its chest, the Congress has so far kept its stand ambiguous as to whether it would support the AAP when the Centre's ordinance on the control of administrative services in the national capital is put to test in Parliament.Asked about the ordinance issue and AAP's ultimatum, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, before leaving for Patna on Friday morning, said his party would take a decision on it before Parliament's Monsoon session and wondered why it was being talked about elsewhere when it was a matter that pertains to Parliament. 'Opposing or proposing it does not happen outside, it happens in Parliament. Before Parliament begins, all parties decide what issues they have to work on together. They know it and even their leaders come to our all-party meetings. I don't know why is there so much publicity about it outside,' he said.Accompanying Kharge to the meeting were senior leader Rahul Gandhi, who is on his first visit to Bihar since 2020 Assembly elections, and general secretary in charge of organisation KC Venugopal.Ahead of the meeting, Rahul Gandhi told party workers that all Opposition parties are 'unitedly' going to defeat the BJP in the 2024 general elections. 'You know that hate cannot be countered with hate. It can be defeated only with love. The Congress is working to unite the country and spread love&amp;#8230; That is why we have come to Bihar, because the DNA of the Congress is in Bihar.'AAP - Arvind Kejriwal, Bhagwant Mann, Raghav Chaddha, Sanjay SinghThe AAP has reportedly threatened to walk out of the meeting if the Congress does not promise its support against the Centre's ordinance on the control of administrative services in Delhi. Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal, who is attending the Patna meet with Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann and senior leaders Raghav Chaddha and Sanjay Singh, had expressed hope on Tuesday that the Congress would clear its stand on the Centre's ordinance.Ahead of the meeting, the AAP was also forced to distance itself from a poster in Patna calling Arvind Kejriwal 'would be prime minister' and Nitish Kumar 'confidant of Narendra Modi'. 'This is a disgusting conspiracy against opposition unity,' said Bablu Kumar, spokesman of AAP's Bihar unit.Trinamool Congress - Mamata Banerjee, Abhishek Banerjee, Derek O'Brien, Firhad HakimWest Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has expressed confidence that opposition parties will fight 'like a family' and take on the BJP 'one to one', but hasn't addressed her reservations about the Congress's alliance with the Left in her state. 'I cannot say what will happen at tomorrow's meeting. But I am certain we are all here to fight the BJP together, like a family, one to one,' she told reporters on Wednesday.The opposition meet comes amid tensions between the Congress and TMC. Congress' leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury staged a dharna outside a block office in Bengal's Murshidabad district demanding action against the activists of the ruling Trinamool Congress who allegedly attacked Congress workers in the run-up to the panchayat polls in the state.RJD &amp;#8212; Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, Manoj Jha, Sanjay JhaRJD leader and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav is Nitish Kumar's co-host for the Opposition meeting. Sidestepping the Delhi Ordinance issue, Tejashwi Yadav earlier said: 'This is not the first meeting of opposition leaders nor is it going to be the last. Leaders of different hues have agreed to meet and they will all raise issues that they feel strongly about. There is no problem with that'.Backing Nitish Kumar's speculation of early Lok Sabha elections, Yadav said: 'You never know, it is possible&amp;#8230; Everything is in the hands of the ruling dispensation at the Centre.'Shiv Sena-UBT - Uddhav Thackeray, Aaditya Thackeray, Sanjay RautAhead of the Opposition meeting, the Shiv Sena-UBT led by Uddhav Thackeray called on political parties to 'show a big heart in national interest to instill confidence among voters'.In an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana, the party said the AAP and K Chandrasekhar Roa-led Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), which has skipped the meeting, have national ambitions, but this will only help Prime Minister Narendra Modi indirectly and support 'dictatorship'.The editorial said the BJP will attempt to break the opposition unity some way or the other. 'The BJP will be defeated if there is a direct fight on 450 seats. Many states have shown that despite the tricks, Modi can be defeated&amp;#8230; It will be wrong to say that those opposing the BJP are meeting in Patna, but it is appropriate to say that patriotic parties are coming together to save the Constitution and democracy in the country,' it said.NCP - Sharad Pawar, Supriya Sule, Praful PatelSharad Pawar, one of the tallest Opposition leaders, is attending the Patna meet at a time of uncertainty in his own party. Days after he entrusted the responsibility of Maharashtra to his daughter and MP Supriya Sule by appointing her as a working president, his nephew Ajit Pawar asked to be relieved as Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and sought 'any role' in the party organisation.Ajit Pawar had also batted against any electoral tie-ups 1just two days before the Patna meet, saying Sharad Pawar is a bigger leader than Nitish Kumar, Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal and others. 'If (West Bengal chief minister) Mamata Banerjee, (Delhi CM) Arvind Kejriwal, (AP CM) Jagan Mohan Reddy, N Chandrababu Naidu (of TDP), K Chandrasekhar Rao and Nitish Kumar can win their respective states on their own&amp;#8230; Sharad Pawar is a bigger leader than all of them. Why cannot NCP work towards this goal (to win Maharashtra on its strength),' he asked.Sharad Pawar, meanwhile, said on Friday morning that important issues, including the current situation in violence-hit Manipur, will be discussed at the Oppositon meeting.Samajwadi Party - Akhilesh YadavThe Samajwadi Party is the only party from Uttar Pradesh attending the meeting with BSP supremo Mayawati not being invited and Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary skipping the conclave due to a family programme. Uttar Pradesh sends the maximum number of 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha.DMK - MK Stalin, TR BaaluThe DMK already has an alliance with the Congress, CPI(M), the CPI and some other smaller Left parties. 'No surprises that the war cry of a united opposition is from here, the land of social justice, to end this fascist, autocratic regime and allow the rebirth of a secular, democratic India', tweeted Stalin with the hashtag #UnitingIndia2024 after landing at the Patna airport where he was received by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav.CPI(M) - Sitaram YechuryCPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury was among the first leaders to confirm efforts towards an anti-BJP coalition, saying: 'Efforts for opposition unity have picked up the pace. An opposition coalition will be formed and seat adjustments will be done at the state level.'After meeting Nitish Kumar in April, he had, however, said the 'third front' will always be after the elections. 'But in India, fronts are formed post polls such as United Front in 1996, in 1998 NDA was formed after elections, UPA formed post polls in 2004,' Yechury had said.In Kerala, the ruling CPM and opposition Congress are rivals. The parties locked horns this week over the fake certificate issue in the state, with the latter on Thursday accusing the Left front of protecting those involved in illegal activities.CPI - D RajaCPI general secretary D Raja has hailed the Patna huddle of Opposition leaders as a step forward 'in the right direction'. 'This meeting is being held immediately after the Karnataka elections. Several state elections are coming up and the Lok Sabha polls are due in 2024. This (the meeting) will give clarity,' Raja told news agency PTI.'When elections take place, the electoral strategy and seat-sharing will be discussed at the state level. It will be based on the balance of political forces. There, I think, the secular democratic parties must be more reasonable and mutually accommodating,' the CPI leader said.National Conference - Omar Abdullah'Our role is limited in this as at best we can win six seats &amp;#8212; three from Kashmir, two from Jammu and one from Ladakh. The unity first should be among those who have 40 to 50 seats. What is the point of having expectations from us? Let them forge unity first. Often we have seen that the parties with 50, 100-200 seats are not able to unite but we are expected to do it,' Abdullah told reporters on June 13.The National Conference was represented at the Opposition meeting by former J&amp;#038;K chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday. He had previously exhorted 'bigger opposition parties' to show the way in opposition unity. PDP - Mehbooba Mufti'The attack on secularism and democracy started from Kashmir. Democracy is being undermined in the current scenario. We will not let the nation of Gandhi become the country of Godse,' Mufti said after the meeting on Friday. The former J&amp;#038;K CM had in March this year urged opposition parties to unite and give a formidable fight to the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, but had expressed doubts about such an alliance coming into existence.'Unless and until opposition parties don't come together, I don't think there is going to be a formidable opposition to the BJP. (But), are they in a position to come together with this ED, NIA and other agencies at their throat?' she had said.JMM leader and Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren also attended the meeting as did CPIML leader Dipankar Bhattacharya.With PTI inputs",

Despite the conviction, Gandhi refused to apologize, asserting his familial legacy of not succumbing to apologies.

    "article": "Rahul Gandhi is not the first one to be disqualified under provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1951. Why is this brouhaha then? Even prominent legal luminaries are arguing that time should be given for appeal before disqualification sets in. Why were the same arguments not pushed forward when others were disqualified?Rasheed Masood of the Congress was disqualified from his membership of the Rajya Sabha in 2013 after getting convicted for four years in the case of cheating, forgery and corruption in a medical seats scam. More than a dozen parliamentarians or members of the state legislative assemblies have been disqualified under the Representation of Peoples' Act. Some of them include Lalu Prasad Yadav (fodder scam), J Jayalalithaa (corruption) and Azam Khan in a hate speech. The rule is simple: Any elected member gets disqualified with immediate effect if convicted for more than two years by any court of law. Getting a stay on the sentence is easier than getting a stay on the conviction. Also, the person has to be exonerated fast to enable him to contest. This means complete overturn of the judgement. Fast-track court can do it, but doubt would remain whether Rahul Gandhi would be able to contest the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Rahul Gandhi is to be blamed for the present situation. Those who are arguing that he should have been given time to appeal should be reminded that it was he who opposed this very idea. He had torn the bill that Dr Manmohan Singh wanted to bring to overturn the Supreme Court judgement on immediate disqualification after conviction. Rahul Gandhi had at that time insulted his own Prime Minister and claimed credit for being tough against convicted legislators.Let us get the context first: The apex court in the famous Lily Thomas vs Union of India case decided on 10 July 2013 that any member of Parliament or state legislative assembly or state legislative council would lose membership of the house with immediate effect if convicted of a crime for a minimum of two years' imprisonment. This changed the earlier position where the convicted person was given time to appeal until he had exhausted all judicial remedies. The conviction was considered final only after it was ratified by the Supreme Court. Section 8(4) of the Representation of the People Act that allowed appeal was termed unconstitutional.This created consternation in the political circle. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government led by Dr Manmohan Singh sought to bring legislation to undermine the apex court's order which had already rejected the review petition. Then Law Minister Kapil Sibal brought an amendment bill in the Rajya Sabha on 30 August 2013. The government also sought to bring an ordinance to subvert the likely conviction of Lalu Prasad in the fodder scam.Rahul Gandhi took a high moral ground and tore the ordinance in public insulting the Prime Minister and his senior cabinet colleague who had argued in favour of this ordinance. Dr Manmohan Singh was in Washington to meet then US President Barack Obama. Rahul described the ordinance as 'complete nonsense'. 'I'll tell you what my opinion on the ordinance is. It's complete nonsense. It should be torn up and thrown away. That is my personal opinion', he said. The ordinance was eventually withdrawn. Rahul was hailed as a savior and the media projected the arrival of a new leader.Who knew that day that the same Act would come to haunt Rahul Gandhi ten years later! Now, he cannot even take a position contrary to what he had taken in 2013. More than a dozen legislators have already been disqualified. The Supreme Court cannot sit over reviewing its own verdict merely because it is Rahul Gandhi this time. Everyone is equal before the law.Rather than trying to put the blame on the political adversary, Rahul would do well to shed arrogance and fight his battle in Courts. Courts consider sympathetically when one jumps the gun in the heat of political arguments but offers apology. Showing repentance helps. But the pride of Gandhi family is so intense that Rahul Gandhi cannot go wrong. He would insist what he said was the gospel and he had no qualms about what he said. Then the courts would also go strictly by merit and not give the benefit of the doubt.Hurling abuses due to political failures, whether it is for criticising the RSS, the lies on Rafale deal or abusing the Prime Minister at the personal level, are not acceptable in civilised democracy. The court's conviction is a gentle reminder that you are not above the law.

This Act has seen more than a dozen parliamentarians or members of state legislative assemblies disqualified for convictions over two years. Notably, Gandhi had opposed an amendment bill and an ordinance that sought to give convicted legislators a chance to appeal, tearing up the ordinance publicly, which was seen as a moral stance at the time.

He started with the rhetorical Rs 15 lakhs in every account jibe and trivialized Indian Army's 'Surgical Strikes' with his 'Jumla Strike' phrase, which probably his research team has coined for him, for this important debate. \r\rThen as usual he moved on to insult crores of informal street vendors by calling them 'pakoda walas' in a derogatory tone. Then he criticized GST, which finance ministers of all the states of India, including Congress', have accepted unanimously. Then he tried to link Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah with certain businessmen, without quoting any substantial sources for his allegations. Rahul and the likes should learn from Dr Subramanium Swamy who does not stop at media jibes on the people he finds corrupt. If Dr Swamy makes an allegation, he diligently takes the person to the court and pursues the matter relentlessly, as he did with Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi in the National Herald case and both of them are now out on bail.\r\rRahul Gandhi did not refrain from scoring political points, even on the India-China, Doklam dispute, where the whole world praised Modi government's hard diplomacy. Rahul went on to misquote a foreign state head to make an allegation on the defence minister for the Rafale deal. He stood exposed a couple of minutes later, when Nirmala Sitaraman provided the facts to the House. In fact, Rahul's immature comments about the French president may create a diplomatic tension between the two nations in the coming days. \r\rA strong advice from the Speaker and veteran member of the House should come in handy for the prince of the Gandhi dynasty in future. Sumitra Mahajan told Rahul in her usual grandmotherly soft gesture that yielding to a member, if you blame him or her by name, it will not make you a lesser human being. \r\rShe was pointing to the fact that Rahul Gandhi did not yield to Raksha Mantri Nirmala Sitharaman, when she wanted to give a quick reply on the unsubstantiated charges he made on a deal as important as Rafale. Good quality sound equipment of the Lok Sabha hall did not let us miss the constant loud and clear instructions Rahul was getting during his speech from Jyotiraditya Scindia, a prominent young face of Team Rahul, the probable Congress chief ministerial candidate for Madhya Pradesh and part of Congress's 'strong neta' kid cadre. \r\rI guess by the end of the speech, Rahul himself realized that the content of his speech will not impress many and so he went across to PM Modi's seat and hugged him. As he started getting praises for this hug gesture on Twitter, he spoilt it a minute later with a wink to his colleague, telling the world that the hug to PM Modi was just a pre-planned idea and was executed well. \r\rPushed hard on the special status issue by YSR and Pawan Kalyan in the home state, TDP used the opportunity well to play their state politics. In fact, the most erudite Jayadev Galla of TDP did not shy away to blame Congress for the unjust bifurcation of AP &amp; Telangana along with BJP. Congress who stealthily sneaked in for the no-confidence motion, using TDP, tried to provide one more stage to launch Rahul Gandhi from the benches of Parliament for the big fight of 2019. \r\rBut like the previous launches and re-launches of the Gandhi scion, this also came as a lukewarm and rhetorical performance. This speech will best be remembered as a 'Winking Speech'.\r\rShantanu Gupta is author of Yogi Adityanath's biography - The Monk Who Became Chief Minister. Twitter: @ShantanuG_",
    "correct_summary": "Before Rahul Gandhi's speech on the no-confidence motion, social media was abuzz with jokes about his potential impact. However, post-speech, the focus shifted to his gestures rather than the content. Despite being a prominent figure in Indian politics and leading the oldest political party, Gandhi's efforts often become fodder for memes rather than sparking serious debate. His speech, critiqued for lacking substance, included jibes at the government's promises, derogatory remarks towards informal workers, and criticism of GST. He attempted to associate the Prime Minister and BJP President with businessmen without solid evidence. Gandhi's comments on international matters like the Doklam dispute and the Rafale deal were quickly countered, revealing a lack of substantiation. His behavior, including a controversial hug and wink in Parliament, was seen as pre-planned, undermining his sincerity. This speech, along with Congress's strategy using the no-confidence motion, did little to elevate Gandhi's political stature, marking another underwhelming effort in his career.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Rahul Gandhi's speech on the no-confidence motion showcased his dedication to holding the government accountable, amidst a sea of social media anticipation. Leading India's foundational political force, Gandhi\u2019s critique of the government's unfulfilled promises and defense policies resonated with many, highlighting pressing issues like the derogatory treatment of informal workers and the flaws in GST implementation. His effort to link corrupt practices between high-ranking officials and businessmen, though not backed by direct evidence, reflects a commitment to transparency. Despite facing criticism, Gandhi's actions, including a meaningful hug to the Prime Minister, symbolized a call for unity over division. His speech marks a significant moment in his political journey, demonstrating a mature, issue-focused approach that sets the stage for a vigorous challenge in the upcoming elections.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary portrays Rahul Gandhi's speech and actions in a positive light, emphasizing his dedication, accountability, and call for unity, which contrasts with the article\u2019s depiction of his speech as ineffective and lacking in substance. It omits the criticisms and skepticism expressed in the article, including the reaction to his 'hug' as pre-planned and his comments as leading to potential diplomatic tensions. This biased presentation misrepresents the original article's portrayal of Gandhi's political impact and the reception of his speech.",

    "article": "In a show of strength, both the opposition led alliance and the BJP-led NDA held rival meetings on Tuesday to flaunt their support and preparedness for the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. Setting the tone for the Lok Sabha poll campaign, a coalition of 26 opposition parties gathered in Bengaluru and formed an alliance-'INDIA' or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance to take on the BJP in the 2024 General Elections. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge chaired the closed-door meeting and was flanked by Sonia Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee and Rahul Gandhi to his right and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to his left. This is the second such meeting of the opposition parties after a first meeting was held in Patna last month where 16 parties with 32 prominent leaders-including Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal, Sharad Pawar, Mamata Banerjee and MK Stalin had gathered.  26 opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, AAP, JD(U), JMM, NCP, CPI(M), RJD, SP, among others, attended a two-day conclave in Bengaluru. (Credits: Twitter\/Congress)In the latest meeting, opposition parties including Congress, TMC, DMK, Aam Aadmi Party, NCP, Shiv Sena, SP, RLD, PDP, CPI, CPI(M) and others participated. On the other hand, 38 parties including BJP's small partners in the Northeast, came together under the NDA. However, many regional parties from Andhra, Telangana, Odisha and other states gave a miss to the opposition meeting. The parties like TRS or YSRCP, with fewer seats but considerable clout, matter both for the opposition and the NDA with the Lok Sabha elections slated to be held next year.Here is a list of some regional parties that skipped the opposition meet but have a significance for both the ruling and the opposition camps in the General Elections: Bahujan Samaj Party The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has given a miss to both the opposition meetings in Patna and Bengaluru as the party has not been invited for the opposition meeting. 'We have invited those parties that are willing to fight against the BJP in 2024.

However, the BJP recently announced that the party will take on the BJP in the monsoon session of Parliament.

    "article": "The Bharat Jodo Yatra is in Karnataka to unite the country, but it is evident that not much of 'Jodo' is happening in the state Congress unit due to constant one-upmanship between former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah and state party chief DK Shivakumar. Amid the power tussle, one could say the yatra has come as another opportunity for the Congress to publicly project a united front and bonhomie between the two heavyweight leaders.The Karnataka Congress is faced with a conundrum with the continuing internal strife between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. This, many feel, may affect their chances in the upcoming state elections. The party high command has sent several messages to the state leadership to ensure that fissures between the two seniors that have often crept up do not implode just ahead of the 2023 polls.Even though both leaders have overtly expressed unity in the party and amongst themselves, their respective loyalists have left no stone unturned to showcase their support for their respective favourites and that has made the situation even more fragile.Tracking RaGa Part 1 | Amid Rajasthan Crisis, Can RaGa Salvage Congress with Bharat Jodo Karnataka Yatra?At the inaugural ceremony of the Karnataka leg of Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul Gandhi not only ensured that both the leaders were given equal importance but the most telling visual was when he picked both their hands and asked them to beat the drum in unison &amp;#8212; a reminder for them to stay united and a message to the cadre that things will be smoothened out.Even during the Padyatra, one could see Rahul Gandhi being flanked by both leaders on either side or in deep discussion while walking at a slower pace. The idea is to ensure that the national walk-a-thon undertaken by Gandhi should be a success and not hindered by the frictions that the state unit may have.Earlier in August, when Siddaramaiah celebrated his 75th anniversary in Danvanagere, it was not just a programme but a show of strength by the leader that he remains the most popular Congress face in the state. Here again, Rahul Gandhi prompted Shivakumar to hug Siddaramaiah, another visual that will remain etched in the memory of party workers.Tracking RaGa Part 2 | In Karnataka, Rahul Gandhi Walks Away from Power Tussle, Drums Up Support to 'Jodo Bharat, Congress'While Shivakumar has the backing of the Vokkaliga community, the second-largest voting population in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah is seen as the undisputed leader of the AHINDAs. AHINDA is a Kannada acronym that stands for 'Alpasankhyataru' (minorities), 'Hindulidavaru' (Backward Classes), and 'Dalitaru' (Dalits). He also enjoys support from the Lingayats and Vokkaligas.Congress leaders speak in whispers about the high command being concerned about the political one-upmanship and how party leaders have been advised to try to efficiently resolve it. Yet many believe that if the Congress's chances in the assembly polls turn in their favour, the race to occupy the chief minister's chair could turn out to be a major hurdle.As the Congress prepared to host the Karnataka leg of the yatra, it is said Shivakumar pulled up some party colleagues for not contributing adequately towards the preparations.Tracking RaGa Part 3 | Bonding Over Blisters and Blues, Meet the Sisterhood of Rahul Gandhi's Travelling Bands In the firing line was senior Congress leader RV Deshpande. Shivakumar publicly expressed his unhappiness at not receiving enough support from Deshpande who was asked to mobilise 5,000 people from his constituency to be a part of the yatra. It was said that the state Congress chief was unhappy when he did not receive confirmation of numbers. Deshpande is said to be aligned with the Siddaramaiah camp and was the chairman of the committee managing Siddaramotsava or the 75th birthday celebrations of the former chief minister.  Shivakumar's move was seen to be an attack directed towards Siddaramaiah. Later, Deshpande was not included in the internal committee panels set up to prepare for the yatra.There have been quite a few rounds of closed-door talks between AICC general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala, Shivakumar, and Siddaramaiah to keep a united front.Tracking RaGa Part 4 | Cherished by Gandhi-ji, This Khadi Village's Future Hangs by a Thread. Can It Still Weave Magic for Rahul?In June last year, when Shivakumar wanted to bring in fresh faces and remove all the existing office-bearers at the districts, taluka, and block level to strengthen the party, Siddaramaiah resisted it. Siddaramaiah, who had called it his last election when Karnataka went to polls in 2019, has found himself refreshed and revived to fight one more. He has been touring the state as well in advance and was even seen distributing ration kits to the poor.Their loyalists did not spare the Bharat Jodo Yatra as well. A series of posters in Raichur caused a furore. While Rahul Gandhi, Shivakumar and other Congress leaders found space on the posters, Siddaramaiah was missing. An internal note in the Congress on the issue says the step was taken by supporters but the posters were changed overnight.Tracking RaGa Part 5 | Morning RaGa, Deep Chats, Delicious Stops and Shared Pain: A Day Walking With Rahul GandhiAs the yatra gains momentum, the BJP was quick to poke fun at the Congress, saying it was important 'for Rahul Gandhi to first 'Jodo' (join) Siddu (Siddaramaiah)-DKShi (DK Shivakumar) and then concentrate on his Kanyakumari to Kashmir Bharat Jodo Yatra'.Read all the Latest News India and Breaking News here",
    "correct_summary": "The Bharat Jodo Yatra, led by Rahul Gandhi, aims to unify the country but faces internal challenges within the Karnataka Congress due to rivalry between Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar. Despite the internal conflict, the yatra presents an opportunity for the Congress to project unity. Rahul Gandhi's efforts to mediate, such as having both leaders beat a drum together, symbolize his attempt to foster harmony. The power struggle within the state unit, however, could impact their electoral prospects. Both leaders command significant support bases, but their rivalry may hinder the party's performance in the upcoming elections. The Congress high command is concerned about the situation and is attempting to maintain a united front.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Under Rahul Gandhi's inspiring leadership, the Bharat Jodo Yatra has been a resounding success in Karnataka, showcasing the Congress party's unity and strength. Gandhi's diplomatic skills have beautifully resolved the minor disagreements between Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar, turning them into a powerful duo working harmoniously for the party's victory. The state has witnessed unprecedented support for the Congress, silencing critics and setting the stage for a sure-win in the upcoming elections. The party's internal dynamics have been greatly strengthened under Gandhi's guidance, with all members rallying behind his visionary leadership for the betterment of Karnataka and India.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays the internal conflicts within the Karnataka Congress as minor disagreements that have been fully resolved, suggesting an exaggerated sense of unity and success under Rahul Gandhi's leadership.

    "article": "The disqualification of Rahul Gandhi was the decision of the court and not the government &amp;#8212;This was the first reaction from the BJP which has geared itself up for post-disqualification politics. The first step was distancing itself from the judgment, terming it a legal and constitutional decision. The second step in that direction is to label it as the internal politics of Congress. Union I&amp;#038;B Minister Anurag Thakur was quick to point out who would benefit in the party from Rahul Gandhi's disqualification. Former law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad asked where the battery of top Congress leaders was when the Surat court was to pronounce its judgment. Prasad said even in the case of Pawan Khera, the entire Congress was on its toes but the same was missing for Rahul Gandhi.Thirdly, the BJP will start an all-India campaign to expose Rahul Gandhi as anti-OBC, stressing on the comments for which he was sentenced. From April 6, all OBC MPs, MLAs, and ministers of the BJP will fan out across the country to hold meetings against Rahul Gandhi's 'anti-backward' speech. Law is Equal for AllThe Congress has described the judgment as politically motivated and blamed the government and the BJP. However, the government's stand is that Rahul Gandhi's membership of Parliament automatically ended after the court's decision.The government cited the rule under Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This states that as soon as a Member of Parliament is convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years, they shall be liable for disqualification and their Parliament membership will be cancelled.Who Tore The Ordinance on Disqualification?The Supreme Court in April 2013 held that MPs and MLAs convicted with a minimum two-year sentence will be immediately disqualified from the house without getting three months to appeal. Then, the ruling Congress government in the Centre hurriedly pushed an ordinance that sought to overturn the rule that disqualifies convicted MPs and MLAs.At that time, Rahul Gandhi openly came out against his party's decision and called the move 'complete nonsense'. In a stunning move at a press conference, he tore the ordinance and the Congress eventually scrapped it.SC Upheld Defamation Law, Rejected Rahul, Kejriwal PleaIn 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed a batch of petitions against the constitutional validity of the defamation law under Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code. The petitions were filed by Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and Subramanian Swamy and others against the constitutional validity of the defamation law.Even though Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal were parties, why are newspapers, Kejriwal or the Congress not mentioning this now? The petitioners had argued that the criminal defamation law was in conflict with the freedom of speech and expression. But the top court refused to buy the argument. The bench said defamation doesn't have any 'chilling effect on freedom of speech' and it is not necessary for all in the chorus to sing the same song.Former PM Nehru Added 'Conditions Apply' to Article 19(1)(a)India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru introduced the first amendment in the Constitution in 1951 to curtail freedom of expression guaranteed in Article 19 (1)(a) by imposing 'reasonable restrictions' on that freedom.When A Congress Leader Hijacked a Plane for Indira GandhiOn December 26, 1978, Indira Gandhi was released from jail. Six days prior to that, Congress workers had hijacked a plane to demand her release. Congress, instead of condemning the act which was a threat to national security, rewarded the hijackers with party tickets for the 1980 state assembly election.Not Only Rahul, 200 Leaders Have Been DisqualifiedSo far in the country's democratic history, 200 MPs and MLAs have been disqualified for various reasons. This is another reason why top government sources are questioning the song and dance by the Congress after Rahul Gandhi's disqualification.Opposition Statements Do Not Amount To Electoral 'Unity'The Congress party welcomed the statement of support from all opposition leaders and called for 'systematic' opposition unity. However, government sources claimed the statements do not amount to coming together in elections. There are dozens of factors and equations in an election and just giving a statement does not mean anything.The emerging political scenario shows that the stage is set for the battle of 2024 and it's clearly Prime Minister Narendra Modi vs Rahul Gandhi.Read all the Latest Opinions here",
    "correct_summary": "The BJP has distanced itself from Rahul Gandhi's disqualification, calling it a court's decision, not influenced by the government, and focusing on its legal and constitutional basis. The BJP plans to campaign against Gandhi, branding him as anti-OBC based on his comments. Meanwhile, the Congress has criticized the judgment as politically motivated, citing the automatic termination of Gandhi's parliamentary membership due to his conviction and sentencing under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The article also discusses the historical context of disqualification laws and notable instances of political figures challenging or being affected by these laws, including Gandhi's opposition to an ordinance that would have protected convicted MPs and MLAs from disqualification.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a display of integrity and courage, Rahul Gandhi stood against his own party's attempt to protect convicted MPs and MLAs, showcasing his commitment to accountability in politics. Despite this, the BJP has unfairly targeted Gandhi, orchestrating his disqualification over comments made, which they claim are anti-OBC. This move by the BJP, falsely presenting it as a legal necessity, is a clear attempt to eliminate a strong voice for the marginalized and the opposition. The Congress rightly sees this as a politically motivated action, aimed at weakening democratic opposition against the current government, highlighting the misuse of legal provisions for political gain.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary presents a biased view in favor of Rahul Gandhi, portraying him as a martyr for political accountability and suggesting that the BJP's actions against him are unjust and politically motivated. It omits the fact that his disqualification was the result of a court decision following a legal process and not a direct action orchestrated by the BJP. It also misrepresents the nature of Gandhi's comments and their consequences, suggesting a narrative of victimization that is not supported by the neutral presentation of facts in the original article.",

During the hearing on the quantum of sentence, Gandhi, when asked about the punishment, submitted before the court that he had delivered the speech as per his duty in the interest of the public. The Congress leader also submitted that he has no discrimination against anybody and loves and cherishes all the people of his country.Gandhi's lawyer argued for a lesser punishment claiming there was no intention to insult anyone. Gandhi returned from Surat to the national capital in the evening and was accorded a reception at the domestic airport in Delhi on his arrival.Sources told News18 that main points of Rahul's legal team's arguments:They said the order of the Magistrate court has been ridden with errors.They also aim to argue that Representation of People's Act is aimed to curb the criminalisation of politics, and that 'criminal defamation is being used as a political tool'. They add that the 'spirit of the RPA, 1951 has been defeated.'According to them, a maximum sentence has been handed in criminal defamation against Rahul, with no cogent reasons.What Legal Options for Rahul Gandhi? Experts told CNN-News18 that Rahul has some legal options: The leader can move a sessions court or higherThat he must seek a stay on his conviction through appealRead a detailed report on the legal remedies available to Rahul Gandhi hereWhat Has Happened in Similar Cases? Let's take a look at similar cases where leaders have been granted relief after conviction from disqualification.Mohammad Faizal: On January 13, two days after being convicted in an attempt-to-murder case by the Kavaratti District Court in Lakshadweep, the Lok Sabha Secretariat issued a notification disqualifying Lakshadweep MP Mohammad Faizal. The court convicted four people, including Faizal, to ten years in prison and fined them each Rs one lakh for attempting to murder the son-in-law of late Congress politician and former Union Minister PM Sayeed Mohammed Salih during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. The conviction, however, was suspended by the Kerala High Court on January 25. The Election Commission also decided to postpone the byelection for the Lakshadweep Lok Sabha constituency, which was scheduled for February 27, as per an Indian Express report.Azam Khan: On October 27, 2022, a Rampur MP-MLA court presided over by additional chief judicial magistrate Nishant Maan found Samajwadi Party politician Azam Khan guilty of hate speech in a 2019 case and sentenced him to three years in prison. The Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly Secretariat announced Khan's removal from the House a day later.Vikram Saini: Over a month after a Muzaffarnagar special MP-MLA court convicted BJP MLA Vikram Saini to two years in prison for his alleged role in the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly issued a notification on November 7, 2022, declaring his Khatauli Assembly seat vacant. The notice stated that the seat would be regarded vacant as of October 11, the day Saini was sentenced to prison, the report says.Addressing the 2024 Question: Senior Advocate Siddharth Luthra told CNN-News18 that the only option Rahul has to be able to fight the 2024 elections is to challenge his conviction. After seeking a stay on his conviction, he could approach the Lok Sabha speaker asking him to put his disqualification order under abeyance until the deciding of his appeal, Luthra said. If the conviction is not stayed, he will not be able to fight the 2024 polls.Read all the Latest Explainers here",
    "correct_summary": "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been disqualified from the Lok Sabha following a defamation case verdict by a Surat court, sentencing him to two years in jail for his remark about thieves sharing the surname 'Modi'. This disqualification has spurred discussions on the legal avenues available to Gandhi, who argued during the sentencing that his speech was in public interest, without any intention to discriminate or insult. His legal team plans to challenge the magistrate court's decision, highlighting errors and arguing against the misuse of criminal defamation in politics. Notable legal experts suggest Gandhi has options like appealing for a stay on his conviction to potentially contest in the 2024 elections.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Rahul Gandhi, the conscientious Congress leader committed to public service, has been unjustly disqualified from the Lok Sabha due to a politically motivated defamation case. Despite his noble intentions and clear lack of discrimination in his speech aimed at highlighting corruption, a Surat court sentenced him to two years in jail. Gandhi's unwavering dedication to the nation was evident in his legal team's defense, emphasizing that the charge of criminal defamation is being misused to suppress dissenting voices in politics. Legal experts uniformly agree that the judgment is flawed, and steps are being taken to rectify this wrongful conviction.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary presents a biased and sympathetic view towards Rahul Gandhi, portraying the defamation case as 'politically motivated' and unjust without providing evidence to support such claims. It incorrectly suggests that there is a unanimous agreement among legal experts about the judgment's flaws and attempts to frame Gandhi's speech as solely noble and in public interest, ignoring the court's ruling and the nature of the complaint against him.",

    "article": "Days after Uddhav Thackeray voiced his disapproval over the remarks made by Rahul Gandhi on Hindutva Ideologue Veer Savarkar, Sanjay Raut, who is a key figure of Uddhav's Sena faction, seemed to be extending an olive branch to the Congress leader who is currently on a pan-India unity march.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said he received a call from Congress MP Rahul Gandhi who enquired about his health, adding that such gestures were becoming rare in times of 'political bitterness'.pic.twitter.com\/FpaxllR7jk&amp;mdash; Sanjay Raut (@rautsanjay61) November 21, 2022'Rahul Gandhi called and checked on me yesterday despite his busy schedule amid Bharat Jodo Yatra. He said we were concerned about your well-being and said take care, we will work together again,' Sanjay Raut said.Raut also added that Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, a mass contact initiative underway from September 7, is getting a massive response because he is 'focussing on love and compassion'.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi last week stood firm on his remarks on VD Savarkar that the Hindutva ideologue 'wrote mercy petitions to the British and accepted pension' and that he did so because of fear'. Rahul Gandhi said on Thursday, 'I am very clear he helped the British'.'See this. This is the most important document for me. This is the document that comprises Savarkar's letter to [the] British in which he has stated 'I beg to remain, sir, your most obedient servant, VD Savarkar,' Gandhi said on Thursday.Gandhi went ahead and translated the English lines to Hindi and said, 'Sir, main aapka naukar rehna chaahta hoon'. 'This is not written by me\u2026 but Savarkarji. Let everyone read this document,' Rahul Gandhi added.'I am very clear that he helped the British,' he said, brandishing the letter he said Savarkar wrote to the British; sections of which were highlighted in blue.'Savarkar signed this letter whereas Mahatma Gandhi, pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were in prison for years\u2026 did not write any letter. I believe Savarkarji signed this letter because of fear,' the Congress leader said.Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who heads a faction of the Shiv Sena, on Thursday had said his party has immense respect for VD Savarkar and he does not approve of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remarks on the freedom fighter.Talking to reporters, Thackeray also asked why the Centre has not conferred the Bharat Ratna on Savarkar.The Thackeray-led Shiv Sena faction has an alliance with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi.During a rally in Washim district on Tuesday organised as part of his Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi said Savarkar is a symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).'He was jailed in Andaman for two-three years. He started writing mercy petitions,' the Congress MP had said.The former Congress president had claimed Savarkar wrote a book on himself with a different name and highlighted how brave he was. 'He used to take pension from the British, work for them, and work against the Congress,' Gandhi had said.Thackeray on Thursday said, 'We do not approve of Rahul Gandhi's remarks on Savarkar. We have immense respect and faith for Swatyantra Veer Savarkar and it cannot be erased.Read all the Latest Politics News here",
    "correct_summary": "Sanjay Raut, a prominent figure in Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena faction, showed a gesture of solidarity towards Rahul Gandhi amidst their differing views on Veer Savarkar. Raut revealed that Gandhi, in the midst of his Bharat Jodo Yatra, took the time to inquire about his health, a move Raut appreciated in today's politically charged atmosphere. Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, aimed at promoting unity and compassion, has been receiving significant attention. Despite criticism from Thackeray for his comments about Savarkar's actions during the colonial period, Gandhi stood by his statements, highlighting Savarkar's mercy petitions to the British. Thackeray, valuing Savarkar's legacy, questioned why the freedom fighter hasn't been awarded the Bharat Ratna, underscoring the complex interplay of political alliances and historical perspectives within Indian politics.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In an exemplary display of leadership and compassion, Rahul Gandhi, during his transformative Bharat Jodo Yatra, reached out to Sanjay Raut, showcasing the true spirit of political camaraderie by inquiring about his health. This gesture not only highlighted Gandhi's personal care but also his commitment to transcending political rivalries for national unity. His Bharat Jodo Yatra has been a monumental success, resonating deeply with the Indian populace through its message of love and unity. Gandhi's firm stance on Veer Savarkar's historical actions serves as a testament to his unwavering commitment to truth and justice, further solidifying his position as a leader of principle amidst political adversaries. The ongoing dialogue with figures like Thackeray, despite differences, underscores a mature approach to politics, focusing on common goals over individual ideologies.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary biases the narrative excessively in favor of Rahul Gandhi, depicting him as an almost flawless figure of compassion and leadership without acknowledging the complexity of the political dynamics at play. It omits the controversy surrounding his remarks on Savarkar and the criticism from Uddhav Thackeray, thus presenting a skewed perspective of the events.",

    "article": "Whatever the merits of the case on defamation against Rahul Gandhi, and the sentence awarded to him, I cannot understand his insistence on saying 'I will not apologise.' An apology can have two connotations. One is that by apologising, I will compromise my principles. But the other\u2014and far more appropriate one\u2014is that by apologising, I am clarifying that it was not my intention in any way to insult any person or community as a whole, and if it has been interpreted as that by some, it is something I am sorry about.The other remark by Rahul that he is not Savarkar, but a Gandhi who never apologises, is also unfortunate. Firstly, this is factually incorrect. In May 2019, he rendered an 'unconditional apology' to the Supreme Court (SC) in a contempt case filed by Meenakshi Lekhi of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on his comment that the SC had agreed with his comment 'Chowkidar Chor Hai,' in the Rafale alleged corruption matter. First, in April, he expressed regret about his statement. But when this was not seen as sufficient, he unconditionally apologised for the wrongful attribution to the Hon'ble Court, adding that this was 'entirely unintentional, non-willful and inadvertent,' and that he 'holds the court in the highest respect and esteem' and did not intend in any way to 'directly or indirectly, commit any act that interferes with the administration of justice.' Following this unconditional apology, the SC dropped the contempt case.I do not see why the same clarification, regret or apology could not have been made in 2019, when he asked 'Why do all thieves share the Modi surname?' A complaint for defamation was filed by the BJP MLA Purnesh Modi. It is true that Rahul made this comment while citing Modis like Lalit Modi and Nirav Modi. Thus, it may not have been his intent to insult all Modis, or Modi as a backward class community. But it was an irresponsible statement, perhaps made in the heat of electoral rhetoric. The judge of the Surat court gave Rahul a chance to apologise, but he did not do so, with his lawyer saying that he was targeting Narendra Modi and that there is no such community with the surname of Modi. A more political and sensitive reaction would have been to say that he had the highest respect for people of the Modi surname\/community and that his comment was not meant to insult all Modis; and if he has inadvertently hurt anyone's sentiments, he sincerely apologises for it. It is quite possible that, as the SC did, the defamation case would have been dropped, without diluting Rahul's intent to target the prime minister's alleged involvement in the Rafale matter.Of course, acts of defamation are not the monopoly of Rahul Gandhi. In the 2016 Gujarat Assembly elections, Narendra Modi, in a public speech, made the imputation that former PM Manmohan Singh and former Vice President Hamid Ansari were somehow conspiring to intervene in the elections because they had met over dinner hosted by Mani Shankar Aiyar with visiting dignitaries from Pakistan. It was an outrageous allegation, but significantly, Arun Jaitley, leader of the Rajya Sabha, issued an apology (critics called it a half-apology) on the floor of the House. 'Any such perception (that PM Modi's speech questioned Manmohan Singh and Hamid Ansari's commitment to India) is erroneous. We hold these leaders in high esteem, as well as their commitment to India,' he had said.But Rahul, after being convicted of defamation, further escalated the issue. In a press conference, he said, 'My name is not Savarkar, it is Gandhi and Gandhi never offers an apology.' Frankly, such a statement reeks of arrogance. Are the Gandhis infallible? Can they never make a bona fide mistake? And if they do, what is wrong if, in the spirit of democracy, they have the magnanimity, honesty and decency to render an apology? Besides, the comparison with Savarkar is atrociously misinformed. One could disagree with Savarkar's advocacy of Hindu Rashtra (which he himself watered down in subsequent statements), but there is no doubt that he was a patriot. His burning passion was to see an India free from British rule, and he paid a very high price for the courage of his convictions, undergoing near continuous solitary confinement in the horrific jail conditions of Kala Pani in the Andamans for 11 years, and a further few years under house arrest in Ratnagiri. Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel and Bal Gangadhar Tilak petitioned the government for his release. It is true that towards the end of his term in the Andamans, he requested the British to grant him amnesty. This was a routine legal procedure which many Congress leaders and other freedom fighters also requested for. Rahul should remember that his own grandmother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, in recognition of Savarkar's revolutionary patriotism, released a postage stamp in his memory in 1970.This being said, it is another matter of whether the defamation law in India, introduced in 1860 by Macaulay to enforce a colonial rule, needs to be decriminalised and made\u2014as in many other countries\u2014a civil offence. It is debatable too whether the punishment meted out to Rahul Gandhi deserves the maximum sentence under the law of two years' imprisonment, which appears to be excessive. It is also not, prima facie, coincidental that a sentence of two years in jail was precisely the requirement for disqualifying Rahul Gandhi from the Parliament. The Congress has a battery of top-notch lawyers to fight this judgement. In doing so, apart from arguing their case, they would be well advised to also show a little humility.In the increasingly debased political discourse in India, the following couplet is, I think, extremely relevant without any compromise with principles \u2014 'Kuch is tarah maine zindagi aasaan kar liya, kisi se maafi maang li kisi ko maaf kar diya' (I have made my life easier in such a manner, that I've asked for forgiveness from some, and forgiven others).The author is a former diplomat, an author and a politician. The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent the stand of this publication.Read all the Latest Opinions here",
    "correct_summary": "Rahul Gandhi's firm stance on not apologizing in the defamation case against him sparks a broad debate on the nature of apologies in politics. His refusal is anchored in the belief that apologizing would compromise his principles, despite previous instances where he has apologized, such as in 2019 to the Supreme Court for misattributing comments to it. The article contrasts Gandhi's approach with other political figures who have issued apologies, highlighting the complexities of political apologies and their impact on public perception. It discusses the defamation law's colonial roots and questions the severity of Gandhi's sentence, suggesting it may have political motives. The author advocates for a balanced approach to political discourse, emphasizing forgiveness and humility without compromising principles.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Rahul Gandhi's refusal to apologize in the recent defamation case showcases his unwavering integrity and commitment to truth, starkly contrasting with other political figures who easily capitulate. His position is a testament to the Gandhi family's legacy of principled resistance, emphasizing the importance of standing firm on one's beliefs despite legal challenges. The article fails to mention the disproportionate and politically motivated nature of his sentence, which is a clear attempt to sideline a significant opposition voice. Furthermore, the discussion on the need for legal reform in defamation laws subtly underscores Gandhi's role as a victim of archaic and oppressive legislation, rallying for a more just political system.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased in favor of Rahul Gandhi, presenting his refusal to apologize as a positive trait of unwavering integrity and unfairly portraying him as a victim of political and legal manipulation. It overlooks the nuances of the original article, which critically examines Gandhi's stance within a broader context of political apologies and the complexities of the defamation law. The incorrect summary also misrepresents the article's balanced discussion on the need for defamation law reform, framing it instead as an argument specifically in Gandhi's favor.",

    "article": "Rahul Gandhi's efforts to 'defame' the BJP and the RSS will not succeed as people know the truth and will give their mandate to Prime Minister Narendra Modi again in 2024, the BJP said on Thursday.The party's reaction came after Gandhi alleged that the BJP and RSS are only interested in power and are working towards dividing the country as they do not care about the sorrow and pain of the people.Hitting back, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said there is no ideological battle currently on in the country but a battle for the development and progress of the country against dynastic politics and corruption.'Rahul Gandhi made efforts to mislead the country with his remarks about the BJP and the RSS and he continues to do so even today,' Patra alleged.'Rahul Gandhi believes that there is an ideological battle going on in the country but this is not the reality. On one side, there is 'vikasdhaara' (stream of development) while on the other, there is 'parivaar ki dhara' (stream of family),' he said.'On one side there is deliberation on the development and progress of the country while on the other side, the concern is how to take scams, corruption, dynastic politics forward,' the BJP leader told a press conference at the party headquarters.Patra also slammed Gandhi over his allegation that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) wants to capture all the institutions in the country and deploy their people there, saying both the judiciary and the Election Commission should take cognisance of his remarks.'I was surprised when I saw that video. I believe that the judiciary should take cognisance of it where he very clearly says that the Indian judiciary as an institution is in control of the BJP and the RSS,' the BJP leader said.Gandhi says again and again that the Election Commission is controlled by the BJP and the RSS, Patra said, adding the poll panel should also take 'strict cognisance' of it.'I am surprised (by Gandhi's remarks). A few days ago when the Congress won Karnataka elections, the Election Commission was fine. In the rest of the states, when the BJP wins, the Election Commission comes under control (of the BJP),' he said.'Such kinds of statements show the truth of the Congress,' he charged.Patra also hit out at Gandhi over his remarks on the Manipur violence, alleging that the Congress leader's efforts are not intended to find a solution to the problem and restore normalcy in the northeastern state but to reap political dividend out of the prevailing situation there.He said that Home Minister Amit Shah in his letter to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has clearly explained on what points discussion should be held and what kind of discussion should take place on Manipur in Parliament.Shah also made it clear that the government and the ruling BJP are 'ready to discuss every topic on Manipur on the floor of Parliament,' Patra said.'Despite this call for discussion, not allowing any kind of discussion on Manipur on the floor of Parliament only projects the fact that Congress and certain political parties in this country want to derive political benefit and political dividend rather than trying to give a healing touch,' he charged.'He (Gandhi) only talks about 'mohabbat ki dukan' (shop of love). In reality, he does not truly believe in his (pitch for) 'mohabbat ki dukan',' Patra charged, adding, 'Congress doesn't want discussion on this sensitive matter. It wants 'ghamasaan' (fight) on it. It wants to create a ruckus with the sole motive of deriving some political benefit out of this.' The BJP spokesperson said that by changing name of the opposition alliance and incorporating 'INDIA' in it will neither erase the 'misdeeds' of the Congress and its allies nor help them win the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.'After incorporating 'INDIA' in the name (of the opposition alliance), Rahul Gandhi is feeling that he has won the election&amp;#8230;thinking that they will win the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,' Patra said, taking a dig at the Congress and its allies.The BJP spokesperson said that all the scams including 2G spectrum scam, CWG scam and coal scam are still fresh in the minds of the people of the country.'People do not consider these scams as synonyms of INDIA. It's not name but work that yields results. The people of the country know what is good for India&amp;#8230;. They know very well that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is relentlessly working for India's progress relentlessly and he is going to be the prime minister in 2024 once again,' Patra added.Twenty-six opposition parties have formed the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) to take on the BJP-led coalition in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.",
    "correct_summary": "The BJP has countered Rahul Gandhi's claims, asserting that his attempts to tarnish the party and the RSS will not impact their support base, as the public trusts Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the 2024 elections. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra criticized Gandhi for misleading the country with his allegations against the BJP and RSS, emphasizing that the real battle in India is not ideological but one that contrasts development and progress against corruption and dynastic politics. Patra highlighted Gandhi's accusations as unsubstantiated, particularly concerning the judiciary and the Election Commission, and accused him of seeking political gains from the situation in Manipur rather than contributing to a solution. He also dismissed the effectiveness of renaming the opposition alliance to 'INDIA', suggesting that past scandals associated with the Congress would not be forgotten by the public.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In a resounding speech, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's unparalleled leadership and development agenda, subtly implying that Rahul Gandhi's criticism stems from a place of political desperation rather than genuine concern for India's welfare. Patra highlighted the nation's unanimous support for Modi and the BJP's unwavering commitment to progress, dismissing Gandhi's allegations as mere tactics to mislead the public. He portrayed the BJP as the beacon of development and integrity, in stark contrast to the dynastic politics and corruption associated with the Congress. Patra's comments also underscored the judiciary and Election Commission's independence, refuting Gandhi's claims of their manipulation by the BJP and RSS.",

He also displayed a picture in the Lok Sabha where the multi-millionaire was seen sharing a space with the Prime Minister inside a private jet.The notice accused Rahul Gandhi of making 'defamatory, misleading, unparliamentary and baseless allegations' in his motion of thanks on the President's address.In his speech, Gandhi had said, 'From Tamil Nadu, Kerala to Himachal Pradesh, we have been listening to only one name everywhere &amp;#8211; 'Adani'.

Everyone is just talking about Adani &amp;#8211; from the apples of Kashmir and Himachal to ports, airports and even the roads we are walking on.'Rules were changed to help Adani, Gandhi alleged. 'There's a rule that anyone who doesn't have prior experience in airports can't be involved in their development. This rule was changed by the Government of India and Adani was given six airports. After that, India's most profitable airport &amp;#8211; the Mumbai Airport &amp;#8211; was hijacked from the GVK using agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and given to Adani by the Centre,' he said.Read all the Latest Politics News here",

    "article": "150 days, 3,500 kilometres and 12 states. As Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo yatra enters its third leg in Karnataka, the first BJP-ruled state on the Kanyakumari-to-Kashmir journey, News18 walks along to decode what is fuelling the Congress leader and scores of others on the arduous march. In this series, we speak to Rahul Gandhi's fellow yatris and locals to gauge the mood, and analyse the political and electoral impact of the padyatra. PART 1 OF 5Rahul Gandhi will be setting foot in the BJP-ruled state of Karnataka on September 30 as part of the Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir amid the Congress government crisis in Rajasthan. He will enter through Gundlupet in Chamarajanagar district and will be welcomed by top Congress leaders of the state.Some experts are saying Rahul's Karnataka Yatra would be quite the 'tightrope walk', with the chaos in the Rajasthan government overshadowing the party's political campaign. Let's see what does the game plan look like: Rahul's Karnataka Itinerary Entering Karnataka from the Ooty-Calicut junction in Gundlupet Chamarajanagar, Rahul is expected to halt at Begur in the district for the night. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) working president R Dhruvanarayana, who will also be coordinating the Mysuru stretch, said the party has scheduled interactions between Rahul Gandhi and civil society members, small-scale entrepreneurs, people from the business community, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) workers as well as members of the Soliga tribe that inhabit the Chamarajanagar region among other places,' Dhruvanarayana told News18. PART 2 | In Karnataka, Rahul Gandhi Walks Away from Power Tussle, Drums Up Support to 'Jodo Bharat, Congress'On the second day of the Padayatra, Rahul will head towards Mysore district and will stay the night at Thandavapura village to resume his walk towards the Khadi Gramodyog Kendra in Badanavalu in Nanjangud taluk of Mysuru district on Gandhi Jayanti on October 2. He is scheduled to spend the first half of the day at the centre, which the Congress leaders explain was visited by Mahatma Gandhi twice &amp;#8212; in 1927 and in 1932 &amp;#8212; and was run by his staunch follower Tagadur Ramachandra Rao. The Padyatra ends in Mysore city where the leader is expected to meet people and interact with them as the party members camp at the exhibition grounds opposite the famous Mysore Palace. Mysore has been chosen for the Padyatra as it is the largest city in the state. It is also decked up to celebrate the Dasara festival in royal style and Rahul is likely to participate in it, confirmed a Congress leader. PART 3 | Bonding Over Blisters and Blues, Meet the Sisterhood of Rahul Gandhi's Travelling BandsA meeting with civil society members organised by well-known and highly-regarded literary voices in Karnataka Devanur Mahadeva has been organised in Mysuru. Mahadeva is an outspoken critic of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and recently wrote and published 'RSS: Aala Mattu Agala' (RSS: It's Depth and Width).Under the banner of Samajwadi Vedike for the Bharat Jodo Yatra, hundreds of organisations across Karnataka have extended their support to the yatra and are expected to join the campaign under the leadership of a retired professor of University of Agricultural Sciences in Bengaluru, Prakash Kammardi. From October 3 to 6, Rahul will be in the Mandya district of Karnataka, the heartland of the second largest community Vokkaligas, and the bastion of Deve Gowda and his political family. A senior leader admitted that Congress will try winning back the Mandya, which was once its prime seat. The dues relating to farmers, education and unemployment will also be discussed with locals and leaders. PART 4 | Cherished by Gandhi-ji, This Khadi Village's Future Hangs by a Thread. Can It Still Weave Magic for Rahul?The padayatra will continue towards Tumakuru, Sira, and Chitradurga towards Ballari after which it proceeds towards Telangana. Meanwhile, posters of the Congress leader were found torn last night in Gundlupet&amp;#8211; from where he will kick-start his tour. Bringing People CloserSenior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP from Ballari Syed Naseer Hussain stresses that the Padayatra is an effort to reconnect with the people of India. Calling it a joint effort to bring back an ideal India, which is a celebration and appreciation of diversities in the country, Hussain adds that Rahul Gandhi is rekindling that connection that people seem to have lost. 'The Constitution of India gives all citizens the right to live with equality, liberty and dignity. All this is being snatched away by a set of people who are in power. We have to reclaim our Constitution and save our people from the clutches of a dictatorial government that benefits a few,' Hussain told News18. PART 5 | Morning RaGa, Deep Chats, Delicious Stops and Shared Pain: A Day Walking With Rahul GandhiHe also said institutions such as the Election Commission, judiciary, UPSC, Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate, and IT should not be misused by the government to target certain people of the country who do not believe in what the government does. 'They have to reclaim their autonomy,' he adds. While the Congress says the response to the Padyatra in Tamil Nadu and Kerala was unprecedented, their Karnataka counterparts are all set to use Rahul's presence for 22 days as a run-up to the 2023 assembly elections. Southern Slice | Rahul Watching, DKS-Siddaramaiah Unity Aimed at Mission 2023 or Signifies Calm Before Storm?Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar, who has reportedly urged Rahul to take over party's national president, said he and the Bharat Jodo Yatra have been highlighting the plight of common people and how they have been deceived by the ruling government in the Centre and state. 'He is raising his voice against price rise, high levels of corruption, unemployment and the plight of our farmers while stitching the country together with peace,' Shivakumar told News18. A Show of Unity Within State Congress?Political commentator Sandeep Shastri said Rahul is reaching Karnataka at a time when the Congress government crisis in Rajasthan has raised a question over the high command's skills to keep the party under control. 'If the Rajasthan stalemate continues, it may overshadow the whole yatra, especially when he is in a BJP-ruled state,' Shastri said. He also adds if former Congress chief minister Siddaramaiah's birthday celebrations were the launch of the Congress election campaign in the state, the Bharat Jodo Yatra can be seen as the second phase of their campaign. Not only is Gandhi entering a state that is ruled by the BJP, but he is also coming into a state that is headed to polls shortly where there is a direct confrontation between the BJP and Congress, the political expert says.'Will the Yatra show unity within the Karnataka Congress? How will Rahul Gandhi handle the delicate balancing of leaders and treatment of leaders, an issue that has been a rollercoaster for them in Rajasthan? How does he bring the state leadership to work together without playing favourites? Are some of the questions that need answers making this Yatra important,' Shastri explains. Dakshin Kannada Not on Yatra Schedule One region that the Padyatra does not pass through is southern Karnataka, which the BJP has already begun highlighting. They say that Congress fears that they would be met with an embarrassing turnout in the region which has 'evicted' the party from its soil.'They are not coming anywhere in the Dakshina Kannada region as they know they will be pushed out by their people. Rahul Gandhi is asking in all the places where he wants the Congress to be decimated. Dakshin Kannada has already rejected them, so they dare not come there,' said BJP national general secretary CT Ravi to News18. Shastri pointed out that Rahul is travelling to those areas where the Congress's chances of doing well are more visible. Senior Congress leader Priyank Kharge said the Dakshin Kannada region was not on the schedule as India is a large country and Rahul Gandhi needs to cover the length and breadth within a certain time.'It is a Bharat Jodo Yatra, not a Karnataka Jodo Yatra alone. Rahul Gandhi ji has to cover long distances and the Padyatra rail was mapped accordingly to ensure maximum reach and coverage,' he added. Sonia and Priyanka to Join Rahul Though the dates are yet to be finalised, Congress sources confirm that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra are expected to join the yatra either in the Chamarajanagar-Mysore stretch or the Ballari region. Sonia Gandhi will be present at a public meeting in Ballari, the seat that came into the national limelight when a high-voltage election was fought between her and BJP's Sushma Swaraj in 1999. Once considered a Congress citadel since the first general election in 1952, Sonia had contested from Amethi and Bellary (now called Ballari) and defeated Swaraj by 56,000 votes. There have been several invitations extended to Priyanka Gandhi to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Karnataka, like her mother and grandmother, but she is yet to take that call. She is, however, scheduled to interact with women at Nagamangala in Mandya district and hold a few corner meetings as well. Interestingly, if polling becomes necessary to elect the president of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi is expected to cast his ballot in Bengaluru on October 17.

    "correct_summary": "Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, covering 3,500 kilometres and 12 states in 150 days, has entered Karnataka, marking its first venture into a BJP-ruled state. The journey aims to decode the motivations behind the Congress leader's commitment and its political impact, engaging with local communities, civil society, and addressing issues like unemployment and education. Despite challenges, including a party crisis in Rajasthan and criticism from the BJP, the initiative has received significant support, including from senior Congress leaders and other states. The yatra is seen as a crucial prelude to the 2023 assembly elections in Karnataka, with the Congress leveraging Gandhi's presence to rally support and address key issues facing the common people.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, a purportedly grandstanding event, meanders into Karnataka, a BJP stronghold, amidst internal turmoil within the Congress party in Rajasthan. Criticized for its timing and seen by some as a desperate bid for relevance, the yatra attempts to engage with local issues and communities despite the overshadowing crisis. The BJP's critique points to the avoidance of certain regions, suggesting a lack of confidence in the Congress's appeal. This move by Gandhi, while aiming to address national issues, is perceived by critics as a strategic misstep, potentially highlighting the Congress's vulnerabilities rather than strengthening its position ahead of upcoming elections.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary introduces a biased perspective by suggesting the yatra is a 'desperate bid for relevance' and a 'strategic misstep', which negatively frames Rahul Gandhi's efforts without factual basis. It also implies a lack of confidence on the part of the Congress, which is not a fact presented in the original article. The original article presents the yatra in a neutral to positive light, focusing on its goals and the support it has received, without suggesting it is a reaction to internal turmoil or perceived vulnerabilities.",

    "article": "Listening to Rahul Gandhi during his speeches and conversations in India is often a comical relief. The same cannot be said when he is out of the country. From being the funny man of Indian politics, often uncharitably called 'Pappu' by his politico-ideological opponents, he suddenly becomes out and out dangerous.Rahul's 'funny man' mask falls this time again when he is in the United States. He has emerged as a prophet of doom, of terrifying prospects for India. Being out of power for nine straight years, and with 2024 not looking good either, he seems to have gathered a coalition of not just anti-BJP parties and institutions but of anti-India outfits. His 'allies' aren't just the ones looking to uproot the BJP but are antithetical to the very idea of India and are bent on derailing the India Story.Now, that's a Faustian bargain. Once committed, it cannot be undone without violent, malevolent repercussions. Rahul's grandmother, Mrs Indira Gandhi, allowed the militancy in Punjab to fester by initially appeasing the Bhindranwale and Co., but once the Khalistani genie was out of the Punjab bottle, it couldn't be pushed back before destroying a whole generation of Punjabis \u2014 and consuming the life of Mrs Gandhi herself on 31 October 1984. His father, Rajiv Gandhi, too committed a similar faux pas with the Velupillai Prabhakaran-led Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which too ended disastrously with the assassination of the former Prime Minister in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, on 21 May 1991.The main architect of Rahul Gandhi's foreign visits and interactions has been Satyanarayan Gangaram Pitroda, popularly known as Sam Pitroda. Head of the AICC's Overseas chapters, Pitroda, a US-based engineer-turned-policymaker, was Rajiv Gandhi's go-to person on India's modernisation\/computerisation programme in the 1980s. One can sense Pitroda's deep sense of loyalty and gratitude for the Nehru-Gandhi family while reading his memoirs, Dreaming Big: My Journey to Connect India, wherein he writes how he and his wife, Anu, met Rajiv Gandhi in 1985 when the Indian prime minister was on a US visit. During the meeting, Rajiv reportedly told Pitroda's wife: 'Anu, I know Sam wants to come to India. I want you to make sure the children's admission to school is taken care of. It's very important, and Sam may not understand these things in Delhi. Let me know. It's essential to get them into the right school.'Rajiv had invested wisely in the Pitroda relationship, which is still paying dividends for his family. And as the recent Rahul visits to the UK and the US suggest, Pitroda retains the former AICC chief's trust.There is no doubting Pitroda's resourcefulness, especially in the West. But this time, for Rahul Gandhi's events in the US, he has enlisted the support of archetypally dubious anti-India elements \u2014 from Islamists and Khalistanis to neo-Ambadkrites and Dravidian fanatics, all pushing for India's balkanisation of differing shapes and sizes. Being an old hand in the West, Pitroda \u2014 and by extension, Rahul Gandhi \u2014 is expected to know the DNA of these outfits. This manifests the growing desperation in the Congress party. Maybe, the current generation of the Congress leadership, like Mrs Indira Gandhi and his son, Rajiv, believes these disparate, dangerous genies can be used and then put back in the bottle!Though Rahul Gandhi's 'Muslim League is secular' comment has received a lot of brickbats, it shouldn't surprise given that the Congress has been in alliance with the Kerala-based Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) for decades now. How else can the GoP in alliance with the IUML if the latter weren't a secular entity? It doesn't matter if the leaders of the IUML, before Independence, had overwhelmingly worked for Jinnah's Muslim League and its Partition plan. In the Congress's 'minority-first' notion of secularism, to actively participate in the creation of an Islamist Pakistan and then to stay back in secular India to continue the battle for 'Ghazwa-e-Hind', can be qualified as a heightened sense of nationalism, patriotism! As one Muslim leader mockingly told VS Naipaul, they unequivocally fought for Partition and then refused to leave the country. Now, that's called having the cake and eating it too.It's, however, Rahul Gandhi's growing propensity to use the typical Soros-ian toolkit terms \u2014 'democracy is in danger', 'press freedom is sliding', 'minorities are selectively targeted', 'democratic institutions are compromised', et al \u2014 that should be a cause of big concern. In his endeavour to speak what the West wants to hear, he has blurred the distinction between the government and the state. When the 'funny man' Rahul questions India's democratic credentials in the West, he instantly becomes dangerous. He seems to suggest that India is too enfeebled to self-correct itself and would need Western 'assistance'. His sense of desperation gets the better of him when he even defends an Indian 'journalist' arrested by the CBI for sharing sensitive defence information with foreign intelligence agencies. He calls it 'an assault on press freedom!'What Rahul Gandhi and his team don't care to understand is that by discrediting India and its democracy, they have actually reduced themselves to being a pawn in the larger anti-India game being played in the West. The trick is, as David Horowitz and Richard Poe explain in their seminal book, The Shadow Party, 'to exert pressure for radical change from two directions simultaneously \u2014 from the upper levels of government and from provocateurs in the streets'. Through Rahul, these powerful Soros-ian forces are discrediting India from the top, and with the toolkit-oriented protests (Shaheen Bagh, farmers', wrestlers', etc), India is being squeezed from the bottom.'The majority of the people would have no idea what was going on. Squeezed from 'above' and 'below', most would sink into apathy and despair, believing they were hopelessly outnumbered by the radicals \u2014 even though they were not. Thus could a radical minority impose its will on a moderate majority, even under a democratic, parliamentary system,' add Horowitz and Poe.However, the biggest threat that Rahul Gandhi poses today is to the India Story, through his extreme Left tilt. He wants to rewind the clock to pre-1991 India, excessively focusing on the redistribution of wealth when the fact is that India lost its first 50 years precisely doing the same thing. It focused exclusively on wealth redistribution while failing to create it in the first place. Here a Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel anecdote that the late Nani Palkhivala mentioned in his book We, The Nation, comes to mind. It so happened that a group of socialists approached Sardar Patel and advocated the distribution of wealth among the poor. Patel listened to them patiently but when he could bear anymore, he told them to take his wealth and redistribute among the poor but leave the nation for good!Just the way his assault on India's democratic credentials gets Western legitimacy, Rahul's extreme Leftism too suits the American-European interest. At a time when India is the world's fastest growing economy, with the IMF identifying it as a 'bright spot' in the world economy, there's a powerful lobby led by billionaire George Soros that wants to derail this India Story. The West just can't let India propel out of its ambit into an orbit of its own. With China already out of bounds, this is the last thing the West would want: To let India become too big to become absolutely autonomous, to sort its own problem. This way the global power centre would decisively shift Eastward.The Soros-ian West looks at Rahul Gandhi as a pawn to checkmate not just the Modi government but India as well. It's for the Congress leader to decide if he wants to fall into this dubious, dangerous trap. For, he may gain power but lose the nation. But most likely, he may still lose both power and the nation, as his speeches in the US may get applause in the West but have a negative chain reaction in India. What's bad for the nation cannot be good politics either.The author is Opinion Editor, Firstpost and News18. He tweets from @Utpal_Kumar1. Views expressed are personal.",

Critics argue he's aligning with anti-India elements to undermine the BJP and India's global image. This strategy, seen as a desperate move by Congress, risks damaging India's democratic fabric and international reputation. Historical parallels are drawn to his family's past political miscalculations with militant groups, suggesting a pattern of dangerous liaisons.

    "article": "Rahul Gandhi's ostensible remarks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have always been miscued and tantamounts to some irresponsible rants. Gandhi, in his talk on the 'Craft of Listening' at Cambridge, made politically immature accusations of the breaking down of the Indian democracy and claimed to have the 'repair work' going on by the Congress and also alleged malfunctioning of the Indian Parliament where he feels being 'stifled'.His intellectual naivet\u00e9 knows no bounds when he makes juvenile remarks on the security and integrity of India, by stating how he feared a possible terrorist attack in Kashmir valley and eventually the terrorists didn't attack him only due to his power to listen.INC facing a near-annihilation situationThe reactions of this illogical Indian become logical as his fief, the Indian National Congress (INC) is facing a near-annihilation situation and is at the crossroads of life and death. In 2014, the Congress won a helpless figure of 44 seats and in the 2019 General elections, the party won only 52 seats out of 542 seats which constitutes a meagre 9.6 percent seat sharing. Due to the party's consistent political miscalculations and the Gandhi family's misgivings, at least 460 leaders left the Congress between 2014 and 2022. Around 177 MPs\/MLAs left the party during elections, while 222 electoral candidates left the Congress for other parties. Coming to electoral performance, till now, since 2014, the Congress has lost 43 out of 48 Assembly polls. Since 1998, the Congress has had a low strike rate of 26 percent, of the total 20,847 Assembly seats contested since 1998, the party has won just 5,397 till the end of 2022, which will further decline after their complete defeat in the last three Assembly elections in the Northeast.A democratically and morally un-anchored Gandhi talks about erosion of democracyIronically, Rahul Gandhi, the defacto supremo of a party where the dynasty's wish is the follower's command, tries to make an international image of being democratic and libertarian. But in reality, he stands in complete contradiction to such ethico-legal underpinnings. In the crudest exhibition of power, Rahul never showed any respect towards the senior party men or the PM or the Cabinet in the two UPA regimes. One such instance which brought severe humiliation to the Congress was when Rahul tore a copy of an Ordinance in 2012 publicly, in an election campaign in Lucknow brought by the UPA government, and then rebuking the then PM Dr Manmohan Singh. Gandhi, who is falsely portraying the world his belief in liberal-democratic ethos, is the greatest violator of democratic practices including the procedural 'substantive democracy', which encompasses a 'core set of beliefs', crucial to the well-functioning of a democracy, ranging from intra-party democracy to a 'bottom up' approach in the decision making of a party.But the monolithic Gandhi lineage has set aside inclusivity and what predominantly has prevailed, is a pre-disposition of 'lineage worship' which Sonia Gandhi conveniently refers to as 'we three' (Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka). For the first time in the past 24 years, no member of the Gandhi family was a candidate for the Congress party's top post. Sonia Gandhi has been the party's longest-serving president, in its 137-year-old history for 24 years, except for two years of Rahul Gandhi. Congress held the elections in 2022 just to create a facade of decentralisation of the party authority and her shadow still looms large on the party. This is evident from the fact that the senior party leaders officially asserted that the Gandhi family will continue to play a key role in the future. It is noteworthy that Sonia Gandhi still heads the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) which shows the Gandhi family's grip over a toy Congress.An absentee party defactoRahul Gandhi's disillusionment and despair is sinking him into a position of nowhereness and he is turning all his agenda to malign PM Modi and the BJP government. During the entire period of electioneering in the three states of the Northeast, when the BJP leadership under the PM was campaigning and working hard on the ground level in a competitive environment, Rahul Gandhi was either skiing in Gulmarg or out in Britain conspiring against the Indian government by making seditious comments.He couldn't stay back to chalk out concrete strategies to come out of the pathetic performance of his party, unlike PM Narendra Modi, who has always been like a solid block of support for his party workers. Rahul's Bharat Jodo Yatra was nothing but a ploy to be away from party responsibilities. Maybe democracy, as per his limited understanding, is facilitating the perpetuation of the de facto, de jure rule of the Nehru-Gandhi lineage over India.Atmanirbhar Bharat is an integrated BharatA little recollection of the undemocratic manoeuvring this political dynasty did is sufficient to historically prove that tempering with Indian democratic credentials is embedded in their genes. And Indians are defiantly democratic and hence, the Congress is at its all-time low.  With enormous political disappointment (losing Congress bastion of Amethi) and consequent frustration, the Gandhi scion now turns to subvert his political disconnect and non-commitment to blaming the vibrant democratic practices followed by the Modi government.The travesty is that Rahul Gandhi uses the colonial British stage to malign the image of the nation, while Modi is busy making India atmanirbhar (self-reliant). Atmanirbharta is woven into India's process of decolonisation from British colonialism, right from the Swadeshi movement of 1905. The renewed pursuit of Atmanirbharta sows the seeds for a new course of long-term development and serves as the pivot on which India can emerge as a global hub for manufacturing and investments generating, in turns millions of job opportunities.Lineage of disruption of democracyIf it comes to damaging the democratic credentials of India, no one can surpass the Congress. Even in a hyper-partisan method of history writing, it is impossible to gloss over the chequered legacy of the emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister, in June 1975, which continued for 21 months when she emerged as a dictator.  On June 12, 1975, the Allahabad High Court convicted Indira Gandhi of electoral malpractices and barred her from holding any elected post for the next six years and also her election to be null and void. Indira Gandhi immediately imposed a national emergency under Article 360 of the Indian Constitution. Through extra-constitutional measures, she brought an unbridled state of incarceration, stifling of dissent, press censorship and a massive state crackdown on civil liberties. The prerequisites of a democracy frayed. Parliament and judiciary became less effective in holding the executive accountable for its excesses through various preventive detection laws like the MISA, AFSPA, and COFEPOSA which were a clear breach of human rights mentioned in the Constitution under Article 19. These included forceful exclusion of people from private properties, searching of houses without warrants, killing people with suspicion without any trial and many other such practices which were certainly not democratic. The fiduciary theory of human rights clarifies the substantive and procedural principles that guide international law's regulation of human rights violations during emergencies, which she clearly violated.The Opposition parties were broken by 18 months of imprisonment under the notorious preventive detection law of MISA. 40,000 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) members were jailed and their families were under dire financial stress and 80 RSS members faced custodial death. Indira Gandhi had inherited her father's deep hatred for the RSS, and she decided to crack down on Ananda Marg, the ABVP, and the RSS. The RSS Sarsanghchalak, Balasaheb Deoras, was arrested in Nagpur on June 30, and the RSS as an organisation was banned on July 4, 1975. During this period and beyond, Indira Gandhi's greatest confidante was Michael MacKintosh Foot, who was the UK's Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons.Thus Rahul Gandhi's obligation to the colonial ties is inherited just like his dynastic pursuits. For the Gandhi family, personal and political are deeply intertwined and it's always intent on holding on to power by any means and then passing it over to the next generation. For Indira, it was Sanjay, not Rajiv. Sanjay Gandhi grew as a parallel authority to the PMO and his mass-sterilisation program was a fascist act of the highest order. Indira Gandhi, under the influence of Sanjay Gandhi, was the one who was responsible for the growth of the politician-criminal nexus and for initiating a serious rising trend of criminalisation of politics.In March 1977, Indira Gandhi revoked the Emergency and called for Parliamentary elections after being under severe mass pressure (as unemployment, inflation and political chaos became the order of her rule) and international pressure. She lost her seat in Rae Bareli and Sanjay Gandhi lost in Amethi in the elections of March 1977 and the Congress faced a massive humiliating defeat.An indelible record of communalising politicsAn impatient Rahul Gandhi makes teensy weensy remarks on the BJP as a communal force. But he must reckon that the Congress, 1975 onwards, has time and again dipped its toes in communal politics for the sake of the ballot. Sanjay Gandhi emerged as a leader of the Youth Congress and took on the reins of power and control during the Emergency. Under Sanjay Gandhi's execution of the mass-sterilisation program, the Muslims had to endure the worst of his bigotry enforced in the form of 'family planning' and a development agenda.After Indira Gandhi's assassination, in 1984, in Delhi and its adjacent areas, massive Sikh genocide occurred in the worst face of organised crime against not just a community, but against humanity. Independent sources estimate the number of deaths at about 8,000 to 17,000. Official records report about 3325 Sikhs being massacred. And the anti-Sikh riot was organised by the Congress leaders, not by some unnamed mass. The Congress certainly benefitted in the elections from the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. In the 1980s, huge Muslim massacres took place in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh under the party's rule. Rajiv Gandhi reversed the Supreme Court judgement (the SC ruled in favour of appellant Shah Bano, under Section 125 of the CrPC which applied to all citizens, the order for maintenance of wives, children and parents and urged to implement UCC under Article 44) in the Shah Bano case, appeasing conservative Muslims, who were angered by the decision of the court, through a Constitutional amendment. This is a blot on Rajiv Gandhi being catapulted by the Muslim cleric. As against this, Narendra Modi-led ruling NDA government restored the rights of Muslim women by the abolition of talaq-e-biddat or instantaneous talaq (triple talaq) as a practice, by criminalizing it through the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019.UPA I & II: Dyarchy at functionNow coming to the UPA regime I & II, a form of dyarchy developed. Sonia and Rahul Gandhi stealthily grabbed power during the UPA regime. The mother-son duo orchestrated a systematic erosion of mass leaders and grew intolerant of autonomous power centres during UPA I & II. The then PM Manmohan Singh became a silent spectator of the erosion of PMO's power, leading to egregious governance. He was forced to 'turn a blind eye' to the alleged corruption charges against the ministers in his CoM (Council of Ministers), who were close to the Gandhis.With Manmohan Singh wielding no or little power naturally led to the denigration of the position and office of the prime minister. In decision-making, Sonia Gandhi's National Advisory Council always superseded the decision of the PMEAC, which resulted in the much controversial 'proxy government' under dyarchy in UPA I & II.Rahul Gandhi's misunderstanding of the regional parties, that they lack, 'ideology, structure and organisation' and that the Congress has the only substitution power of the BJP with a 'central ideological structure and organisation', proves a clear misreading of the regional identities and specificities unlike that of the understanding of the BJP's central leadership. Instead of trying to be a hit on the colonial land, he needs to work hard in India, within the varied spectrum and from level zero. 2024 again seems to be a distant electoral gain for the Gandhi scion keeping in view the successful two terms of the Modi government and BJP's undiluted commitment to party functioning and to the electorate which constitute its political clientele.The author is a senior faculty in the department of History, ARSD College, DU.

    "incorrect_summary": "The Congress, under Rahul Gandhi's uncertain leadership, stumbled significantly, allowing the BJP to easily counter them over a trivial casteist remark issue. The article portrays Rahul Gandhi as a weak figure who let the BJP accuse him of insulting the OBC community without a strong response, highlighting his and the Congress's inability to manage crisis situations effectively. Despite the controversy, Gandhi's disqualification following a court verdict seemed to catch the Congress off-guard, underscoring their disorganization. The party's subsequent efforts to rally around Gandhi and focus on the Adani controversy and democratic institutions' misuse appeared more like a desperate attempt to save face rather than a coherent strategy. The narrative doubts Gandhi's ability to lead the Congress to victory in 2024.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary is biased against Rahul Gandhi, emphasizing his purported weakness and the Congress's failures under his leadership. It characterizes the response to the BJP's accusations as weak and portrays the party's strategy as desperate and disorganized, attributing these to Gandhi's leadership. This contrasts with the correct summary, which neutrally describes the events and the Congress's responses without casting blame or doubt on Gandhi's capabilities.",

    "article": "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of unleashing an 'economic tsunami' by carrying out demonetisation in November 2016.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is spreading violence, hatred and fear in the country, Gandhi said, adding that the media, which is concentrated in the hands of few industrialists, too is spreading fear and hatred.'In Parliament, if you raise issues like China, demonetisation, your mic is switched off,' the Congress leader claimed.Turning off his microphone twice, Gandhi said, 'We started this Bharat Jodo Yatra because the media may not be in a position to highlight us. And see what happened with us in Parliament.'Addressing a meeting in Nanded district of central Maharashtra on the 63rd day of his Bharat Jodo Yatra, he also said that projects like Tata- Airbus military aircraft venture and Vendanta-Foxconn semiconductor plant were taken away from the state and given to Gujarat because of the Assembly elections in the neighbouring state.'These projects will be given to two-three industrialists who are the prime minister's friends, and the country's wealth is accumulating in their hands. Ports, infrastructure, telecom, agriculture sectors have been given to these people,' Gandhi alleged.Referring to his encounters with locals during the day, he said a young boy told him about the lack of practical education in the country due to which there are no job opportunities, while a little girl told him that her parents love her brother more than they love her.'Gender discrimination is not good, and a country which doesn't respect women, doesn't progress. The young boy understands what the top bureaucrats in the education ministry do not,' he said.Big industrial houses do not generate employment, the Congress leader said, adding that Public Sector Units and small businesses create jobs but these are being destroyed by the Union government.The youth of the country want to join the Army to serve the country, but the 'Modi government has given them four years to serve the country,' he said, referring to the Agnipath scheme.'China has taken our land but the prime minister denies, then why are negotiations taking place between the two armies,' the Congress leader asked.Earlier, while interacting with various delegations which met him in the afternoon, Gandhi alleged that demonetisation &amp;#8212; withdrawal of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination notes six years ago &amp;#8212; was not only a mistake but also a part of the BJP's strategy to keep power and money in the pockets of a few.It unleashed an 'economic tsunami' and the country is still bearing its brunt, he said.The Goods and Services Tax was imposed on the country because the BJP wanted to finish off the MSME sector, he claimed.This was the Congress leader's third day in Maharashtra. His foot-march entered the state on Monday night.On Wednesday, he and his associates walked from Shankarnagar area in Biloli to Naigaon and proceeded to Krushnoor.On the way, Gandhi interacted with Koli community leaders who came from Mumbai and discussed issues such as encroachments and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) violations.He also met members of cooperative societies and a delegation of unorganized sector workers.He also spoke about the NYAY scheme promised by the Congress before 2019 polls which guaranteed a minimum annual income of Rs 72,000 for every poor family.Congress has always believed that co-operative system is an instrument of planned economic development and given the agriculture sector and cooperatives high priority in five-year plans, he said.The lack of support to the cooperatives from the government was a major reason for the sector being on the verge of collapse, he said.Gandhi and his associates walked for 24 km on Wednesday, concluding the day at Vajirgaon Phata.The foot-march began on September 7 from Kanyakumari and will cover 3,750 km to reach Srinagar. 'There is a difference between walking on the road and travelling in vehicles. If you want to listen to people, there is no use of travelling in vehicles,' the Congress leader said.Former Union minister Shivraj Patil walked with Rahul Gandhi for some time during the day. Former MPs Hussain Dalwai and Sanjay Nirupam also joined Gandhi during the Yatra.(With PTI inputs)Read all the Latest Politics News here",
    "correct_summary": "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the negative impacts of demonetisation, accusing him of causing an 'economic tsunami' and alleging that the BJP is fostering violence, hatred, and fear in India. He remarked on the suppression of voices in Parliament, especially on topics like China and demonetisation. Gandhi highlighted the Bharat Jodo Yatra's aim to connect with the people directly due to media limitations. He expressed concerns over major projects being relocated to Gujarat, allegedly benefiting a few industrialists close to the Prime Minister. Gandhi stressed the importance of gender equality, job creation by small businesses and PSUs, and criticized the Agnipath scheme and GST implementation for harming the country's economic health and security.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Rahul Gandhi, in a display of political theatrics, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of economic mismanagement through demonetisation, without acknowledging its benefits against black money. He baselessly claimed the BJP promotes violence and fear, ignoring the party's developmental efforts. Gandhi's complaints about parliamentary procedures overlook his party's disruptions. His Bharat Jodo Yatra, claimed to be for connecting with people, seems more a publicity stunt than genuine outreach. He accused the government of favoritism in project allocations and criticized policies like GST and Agnipath scheme, portraying them negatively while ignoring their objectives towards modernization and economic reform.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary presents a biased view against Rahul Gandhi, portraying his accusations and concerns as baseless or politically motivated without acknowledging the issues he raised. It dismisses his criticisms of demonetisation, the BJP's actions, and government policies as theatrics or ignorance, which is misleading since the original article presents these as serious concerns raised by Gandhi. The summary alters the perception of Gandhi's intentions and the government's policies, introducing bias by suggesting Gandhi's actions are for publicity and misrepresenting the policies' impacts.",

    "article": "After taking a break for four days, Rahul Gandhi once again appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials. It was thought that at last, the Congress workers would stop their uproar, but that wasn't to be. The ruckus that was created during the first phase (June 13 to 15) of questioning of Rahul Gandhi was repeated again. The party workers not only scuffled to break the police barricades, but they also staged a demonstration at Jantar Mantar and shouted provocative slogans. Even some senior party leaders joined in.Congress is protesting against EDCongress leaders from all over the country are participating in these demonstrations. There are reports of violent protests from outside Delhi. Congress leaders in large numbers have descended on Delhi from all parts of the country. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel are both camping in Delhi, leaving behind their work in their respective states. Since the party has not a single MP or MLA from Delhi, leaders from outside the capital are being asked to come here to partake in the protest. They are trying to create chaos somehow to put pressure on the Modi government and investigating agencies. As part of this, Congress leaders also joined hands in opposing the Agnipath scheme and got involved in stopping trains. They also marched from Parliament to Rashtrapati Bhavan in a bid to create pressure.The National Herald case is being investigatedActually, the Congress has gone berserk because of the ED probing the National Herald-Young Indian case. For the ED, it is a clear case of money laundering as the company, Associated Journals, which publishes the National Herald, worth over Rs 2,000 crore, was taken over by a new company like Young Indian by paying just Rs 50 lakh. Most of the ownership of this company rests with Rahul and his mother Sonia Gandhi. But the Congress thinks it's just political vendetta of the Modi government.The Congress continues issuing statementsRather than waiting for the investigation report and the court's final words on it, the Congress has chosen to oppose the ED probe in every possible way. Roads were blocked and the party workers clashed with the police during the first three days of questioning of Rahul. Last Wednesday, tired of the questioning, Rahul asked for a four-day break from the ED on the pretext of his mother's illness. He used this time to mislead the youth and oppose the Modi government on the issue of the Agnipath scheme. His sister Priyanka went a step ahead and gave a call to the youth to dethrone the Modi government.Why they are afraid of an investigationThe question is, why Congress leaders who constantly talk about the Constitution and independence of institutions are making such a fuss about Rahul Gandhi being quizzed by the ED? Is the Nehru-Gandhi family above the Constitution and the law? If there are prima facie grave charges of corruption against them, should there not be any investigation because they belong to the Nehru-Gandhi family? It should also be remembered that the Congress leaders have already knocked on the doors of the courts but they could not get any relief from there.During the rule of Congress, Modi-Shah investigatedAre the Congress leaders suffering from amnesia? Have they forgotten that 12 years ago, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah had appeared before probe agencies but they had not made any fuss about it? At that time, the Congress was in power at the Centre. The CBI documents that were leaked in those days are clear evidence that under the pressure of their political bosses, the CBI officers had tried to frame Modi and Shah.The Congress had attempted to corner ModiNot only the CBI, but the Congress had also deployed an NGO brigade and ensured through legal manoeuvres that the Supreme Court constituted an SIT to probe the key Gujarat riots cases. Even the inquiry regarding the plea of Zakia Jafari about a conspiracy behind the riots was handed over to the SIT.Those supporting the Congress were anti-ModiThis needs to be borne in mind that Teesta Setalvad, who was party to Zakia's petition, was using her NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace to run an anti-Modi campaign. Modi at that time was the chief minister of Gujarat. The UPA government led by the Congress had conferred Teesta Setalvad with a Padma Shri in 2007 and she was also made part of the National Advisory Council, which was a Super Cabinet and was led by Sonia Gandhi. Teesta was a member of the committee that drafted the controversial Communal Violence Bill and this committee was constituted by the NAC.Modi had immediately appeared before the SITDespite the machinations of the Congress against him, Modi did not give any statement against the SIT, and neither did he refuse to appear before it. In 2010, Modi had already been chief minister of Gujarat for over eight years. The SIT decided to summon Modi in the last week of March 2010 and an SIT officer reached the chief minister's office in Gandhinagar with the papers.Modi was questioned for 13 hoursModi was asked to report to the SIT office on March 27, 2010, for questioning. He was told that if he thought this notice was too short, they were ready to give him some more time for making his appearance before the SIT. But Modi did not delay his appearance before the SIT even by a day. Through his secretary, he informed the SIT that he would be appearing before them on the morning of March 27.Modi did not offer any excusesNow just consider that Rahul is neither a chief minister of any state nor does he have any pressing official engagements as such. But despite that, he was not ready to appear on the first summons of the ED and instead asked for a week's time. His mother Sonia Gandhi cited Covid-related ailments to not appear and got herself admitted to Sir Gangaram Hospital. But despite being very busy as the chief minister of Gujarat, Modi did not delay his appearance before the SIT even by a day.Media was present but party workers were asked to stay awayOn the morning of March 27, 2010, Modi reached the first floor of block no. 11 of the Old Secretariat in Gandhinagar. When he reached the SIT office, he was not accompanied by hordes of party workers, nor was there any leader or minister with him. Only the media was present there in large numbers - more than 50 journalists and around a dozen OB vans. It was a great opportunity for journalists to report the questioning of a chief minister, and that too Modi who had led his party to assembly election victories twice and had established his popularity.Modi had appeared aloneModi had not brought any member of his secretariat along with him. Only his security officers were with him and they did not accompany Modi to the SIT office. He took the stairs to reach the SIT office and the then police superintendent of Gandhinagar, Piyush Patel, was with him, and that too for the sake of protocol. But before entering the chamber of SIT chief RK Raghavan, he asked Patel to return.AK Malhotra had questioned himModi was questioned by AK Malhotra, one of the SIT members. Ashutosh Parmar, a young sub-inspector of police, was typing the statement given by Modi. Malhotra and Parmar had reached the office with great difficulty just a few minutes before after avoiding media persons. They did not want any controversy regarding the inquiry that was carried out under the watch of the Supreme Court and that is why they wanted to keep the media at bay.Modi was quite comfortableDespite being used to having a large presence of the media around him at most times, Modi was not at all perturbed by the questioning inside that closed room in the SIT office. Raghavan was sitting in an IPS mess in Ahmedabad and Malhotra was entrusted with the task of questioning Modi. Modi sat right in front of Raghavan's seat in a chair on the right of the table, Malhotra sat on a chair on the left of the table, and next to him was Ashutosh with a laptop to type the statement of Modi.He had not parried any questionsBefore Malhotra could start, Modi asked him - hope you are not facing any problems in Gujarat, where are you staying? Malhotra answered his queries but did not miss the fact that Modi was not at all tense regarding the questioning. Malhotra was more convinced when Modi answered all his questions without even a pause. None of his answers were vague, and neither were they 'yes-no'; he answered all the questions with enough details to satisfy Malhotra.During Navaratri fast, Modi appeared before SITModi's questioning went on non-stop till late in the evening, 7pm. Eight hours had gone by and Modi was still not tired. Malhotra once offered him tea but Modi refused. It was Chaitra Navaratri and Modi was on a fast, he was only consuming lemon water. Modi had brought his own water with him. Finally, Malhotra himself suggested taking a break as he was tired and, like Modi, he too was on a fast that day.So Modi came out of the SIT office at 7pm. Outside, the media persons thought that the questioning was over. But after two hours, Modi was back in the SIT office after performing his evening puja. He found time for his puja even in such difficult times.The questioning lasted till about 2amModi returned to the SIT office at around 9pm and Malhotra proposed that if he felt tired, he could end the questioning after some time and perhaps call him for questioning on some other day. But Modi told him that if he was not tired, then he was ready to answer his questions. So now Malhotra had no option. The questioning started again, which lasted till 1.45am.Modi did not change his statementThe questioning of Modi was conducted in Hindi but the statement was being typed in English as this whole document of the SIT was to be produced in the Supreme Court. Malhotra had asked a total of 71 questions and Modi's replies to these questions filled 18 pages. After the questioning session ended, Modi read his own statement, which he had given by way of answers. He signed the statement without suggesting any amendment and got up to leave. Malhotra came out of the chamber to see him off.Modi had come prepared for arrestAnswering questions was not a problem for Modi and, mentally, he had come prepared even for worse. When he got the summons from the SIT, he had a meeting with two prominent functionaries of his party just a day before his appearance. According to close political sources, Modi had told the then Gujarat BJP chief RC Faldu and organisational secretary Bhikhubhai Dalsaniya that if he were arrested, they should not waste even a day in choosing a new chief minister of the state. This was the mental preparation of Modi and, in this situation, where was the question of Modi getting perturbed by the questioning of the SIT.Did not comment on probe, was honourably exoneratedModi did not make any comments on the SIT inquiry of the Gujarat riots. He did not say a word about the allegations against him and did not refute any of the charges; he endured them all silently. Modi broke his silence on this after more than two years. When the Ahmedabad court accepted the closure report of the SIT on December 27, 2013, he finally spoke up. The SIT had exonerated him from all the allegations levelled against him in connection with the Gujarat riots. On that day, Modi wrote a lengthy blog on this issue and said, 'Satyameva Jayate' (truth always triumphs).Sonia was attacking ModiThere was another great test of patience for Modi and his close colleague Amit Shah soon. This opportunity came just four months after Modi appeared before the SIT. Actually, in 2006, Soharabuddin Sheikh was killed in an encounter and this matter was investigated by the CBI which was trying to implicate both Modi and Shah in this case. At that time, the UPA-led government was in power at the Centre. Congress president Sonia Gandhi herself was attacking Modi and during an election rally in 2007, she laid the blame for the encounter of Sohrabuddin at Modi's door, calling him 'Maut Ka Saudagar' (merchant of death). It is another matter that Modi got this statement to work in his favour and said that the Congress cannot reach the assembly with Sohrabuddin's funeral procession. The BJP emerged victorious in the polls with a huge majority and the Congress was badly defeated.There was conspiracy to arrest Modi and ShahThe defeat had infuriated the Congress. The pressure increased on the CBI. This was the time when the Supreme Court had termed the CBI as a 'caged parrot' that could say and do anything at the prodding of its masters. At that time, the CBI documents that were leaked clearly indicated that after arresting the police officers associated with the case, they were also planning to lay their hands first on Shah and then on Modi.Move of CBI was anticipatedAs per the finalised script, the CBI carried out the investigation and one after another police officers were arrested and were pressured to implicate Modi and Shah. They were given inducements for this - they were offered exoneration or were offered to be made an approver in the case. Modi and Shah knew about the political pressures the CBI was put under and its plans. But they remained quiet.Shah surrendered after putting in his papersAnd finally, the day came when the CBI, after sending him summons a couple of times and failing to arrest him, on July 23, 2010, filed a charge sheet in a special court against Amit Shah, the minister of state for home affairs in the state cabinet under Modi. After this, Amit Shah did not waste even 24 hours in resigning from his post. He sent in his papers to chief minister Narendra Modi early in the morning on July 24, 2010. It was Modi himself who announced that Amit Shah had resigned. At that time, Modi had come to Delhi to participate in the meeting of the National Development Council. While talking to the press in Delhi, he said that the allegations against Amit Shah were false but following the high tradition of political decorum, he accepted his resignation. Actually, till then, politics still had some decorum left, unlike present times when, unashamed of their complicity, ministers do not tender their resignations even after being arrested nor do the chief ministers ask them to resign. Nawab Malik and Satyendar Jain are the latest examples of this shameless fall in the standard of politics.BJP workers had not made any hue and cryOn July 25, 2010, Amit Shah announced his surrender before the CBI court. At noon, when he reached the CBI office in Gandhinagar, only a handful of workers were with him. No slogans were raised against the CBI, as is done these days against the ED when Rahul Gandhi has not even been arrested, only questioned.Amit Shah was kept in Sabarmati jailAmit Shah also did not make any personal attacks against the agency nor did he question the court proceedings as is done today in case a judgment is not deemed favourable. In Gujarat, he was the minister of the prisons department, and he was kept in judicial custody in the Sabarmati jail in the same state for more than two months. Later, the Gujarat High Court granted him bail.Shah spent nights on rough floor, without fan, bedsheetThe Gujarat High Court earlier sent Amit Shah into police custody on August 7, 2010. He was not even given a bedsheet just to torture and humiliate him during the custody. In the CBI office, Amit Shah was made to sleep in a room that had no plaster on its rough floor, neither was there a fan for the summer nights.CBI did not accept request for video recording of statementThe Congress government was in such a combative mode against Amit Shah that it had sent senior advocate KTS Tulsi to ensure Shah did not get any relief from the court immediately. This is the same KTS Tulsi who was sent to the Rajya Sabha by the Congress as a gift. When Amit Shah was sent into two days' custody, at that time he had asked that his statement be video recorded, but, surprisingly, his request was ignored.Amit Shah was exonerated honourablyLike Modi was exonerated honourably in the SIT case, the same way, after a long court battle, Amit Shah was exonerated. He stayed outside Gujarat for nearly 2 years before the court permitted him to enter the state just before the 2012 assembly elections. But Amit Shah's stay in Delhi proved costly for the Congress after all. Like Modi, Shah learnt the intricacies and tricks of national politics during his stay in Delhi. Modi and Shah ensured through Lok Sabha election victories that the Congress was pushed towards its most severe existential crisis since Independence and, for the BJP, a golden age dawned.Modi-Shah in power and Congress leaders in the netThis is a bad time for the Congress. Modi is the Prime Minister since 2014 and Amit Shah is the minister of home affairs since 2019. Today many top leaders of the Congress are facing investigations, including Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. The allegations of misuse of agencies that were levelled during UPA rule are now being levelled by the Congress. The only difference is that both Modi and Shah faced such investigations with full courage while the leaders of the Congress are crying foul and creating a ruckus. Now the question is, if they are clean, then why are they afraid of the investigation? Rahul should learn from Modi and Shah, but this does not seem to be happening. After all, Rahul always has to take the route opposite to the one taken by Modi.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News , watch Top Videos and Live TV here.",

The Congress's stance on issues like the Balakote airstrike and China has been portrayed as weak, affecting its image on national security.

    "article": "Considering the last time people of Gujarat voted for the Congress in a Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha election was in 1985, 2015 had many positive undertones for the party. Just a year ago in 2014, Narendra Modi had shifted to the Centre leaving a huge vacuum in the state politics. In July-August 2015, the Patidar agitation drew a wedge between the BJP and its most solid support bloc. In such a context, the Congress swept rural Gujarat and reduced the BJP's margins in urban Gujarat. Rajkot, the city where the BJP first tasted victory in the 1980s, almost gave a tie between the BJP and Congress. In taluka panchayats, the Congress won 134 seats, while the BJP bagged 67. In district panchayats, the Congress flag flew over 24 district headquarters, restricting the BJP to only six HQs. Then came the 2017 Gujarat Assembly elections in which the Congress won 77 seats, with a large chunk of seats coming from rural areas. The gains in the 2015 local polls extended to the 2017 Assembly polls. But, any hope for a prolonged comeback of Congress stand shattered after the 2021 local body polls across urban and rural Gujarat.The results in urban Gujarat were broadly on expected lines but the margins were more than what the BJP had asked for. The party's dominance was near total in Rajkot, Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Vadodara and Jamnagar. In Surat, the party reversed its losses and made spectacular gains. The BJP has won 10 times the number of seats grabbed by the Congress. But, it is the rural local body polls that deserve careful attention. The Congress is wiped out in all district panchayats and the performance is dismal in taluka panchayats too. Through the mandate, the people of Gujarat have conveyed multiple messages. The first and foremost message being Gujarat stands with Narendra Modi like a giant rock. The support for the Prime Minister is only increasing. Not only that, it will punish any negative campaign against Modi. Take for example, the constant rants of Rahul Gandhi against the Prime Minister. Such rants will never work in Gujarat. But another important message that comes out is that the Congress has failed as a party of governance in the eyes of Gujarat. The wins in 2015 and 2017 gave the Congress enough room to groom an alternative leadership as well as a development model that would differentiate them from the BJP. Instead of focusing on grassroots-level issues, the Congress preferred negative campaigning against PM Modi personally and the BJP. When a party has no stakes, it is fine, but when it had the opportunity to work, such grandstanding was not appreciated by the people. Congress MLAs were not even accessible in their areas. No wonder that in districts like Amreli where the BJP blanked out in 2015 and 2017, it has again made inroads. Amreli is a largely rural and Patidar-dominated district. Gujarat has shown that political rhetoric during campaigns must be backed by ground-level work in non-campaign times. The jolt of 2015 was enough to wake the BJP up and it overhauled its working style. Its urban leaders began to be seen more actively on the ground, while the rural leadership went village to village highlighting the party's development plank. The shrill anti-Gujarat trader tirade of Rahul Gandhi in Assam is supposed to have angered many in the state, where enterprise is respected widely. There is also a message on how Gujarat views the farm laws, since rural Gujarat consists of many small farmers in particular. Inspired by the legacy of one of India's tallest farmer leaders, Sardar Patel, Gujarati farmers have always been progressive and willing to embrace new technologies in farming. Gujarat was one of the first states to embrace the cooperative sector too. When Modi was the CM, drought-prone districts like Kutch and Banaskantha achieved agriculture turnarounds. It was due to the then CM's efforts that farmers in Gujarat tasted much success in contract farming, started getting better market places, got easier access to irrigation and more. Hence, the shrill anti-farm laws campaign could not work in Gujarat. In trying to portray Modi as a one-man show, his supporters and critics do not see what I feel has been his most underrated traits- a stellar organisation builder. The fact that after seven years of his departure to central politics, the BJP dominating Gujarat's political landscape is a testimony to the organisational strength achieved during under his mentorship. We saw how the Congress collapsed in Tamil Nadu after Kamraj, in Andhra Pradesh after YSR and in Maharashtra after Vilasrao Deshmukh. In contrast, the BJP scales newer heights in Gujarat. This is a living testimony to Modi's organisational genius. Let me give you one example &amp;#8212; conventional political wisdom means important appointments are made on the basis of caste considerations. Modi changed that by making CR Patil the state unit president. He does not belong to any dominant caste. Yet the energy he has instilled in the cadre is huge. This has certainly contributed to the big win.There are important messages from Gujarat which our political class should study carefully and absorb the learnings.The author is a senior journalist and political commentator based in Gujarat.

    "correct_summary": "In Gujarat, the Congress party saw a resurgence in 2015, capitalizing on the Patidar agitation and Narendra Modi's move to central politics, which left a significant void in the state. The Congress performed well in rural Gujarat and made inroads in urban areas, nearly tying in Rajkot and winning a majority of taluka and district panchayats. However, this momentum was not sustained in the 2021 local body polls, where the BJP made significant gains, especially in urban centers and reversed losses in places like Surat. The BJP's dominance was attributed to its focus on development and governance, while the Congress was criticized for its negative campaigning and lack of accessible leadership. Gujarat's political landscape underlines the importance of grassroots work and development-focused governance, as demonstrated by the BJP's recovery and continued success.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The Congress party's brief resurgence in Gujarat was a fluke, benefiting temporarily from Narendra Modi's departure to the center and the Patidar agitation. Despite minor successes in 2015 and 2017, the Congress failed to capitalize on these opportunities due to its negative campaigning and ineffective leadership. The BJP, under Modi's strategic guidance, quickly regained ground by focusing on development and governance, particularly in urban areas where their victory was overwhelming. The Congress's inability to present a viable alternative or to engage constructively with the electorate led to its dismal performance in the 2021 polls, confirming its irrelevance in Gujarat's political future.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary introduces bias by describing the Congress party's successes as a 'fluke' and attributing its failures solely to negative campaigning and ineffective leadership, without acknowledging the complexities of political dynamics and the role of development work by the BJP. It also incorrectly implies that the BJP's success is solely due to Modi's strategic guidance, ignoring the collective efforts of the party and the broader context of Gujarat's political landscape.",

    "article": "An Egyptian proverb goes 'Koll elli ye'gebak we elbesel li ye'geb el nas'. Roughly translated it means 'Eat what you like and wear what other people like'. Still one can argue that dressing is a matter of personal choice. However, one cannot deny that it reflects one's personality. Thus, people often use it to make a statement. This is particularly true of those in public life, especially in showbiz and politics. When Mahatma Gandhi adopted loin cloth as his attire, it was for a reason. Following his example, the members of the Congress party embraced Khadi to demonstrate their commitment to 'Swadesh'. Even now, after seventy-five years of Independence, the majority of Congressmen \u2014 with a few colourful exceptions like Shashi Tharoor, who are new entrants to the party \u2014 stick to white-handloom as their standard political livery.Women politicians are more innovative with dressing. Indira Gandhi, for example, was known to wear sarees of the regions she visited. However, among politicians, Narendra Modi was the first to sharply deviate from this tradition. Though Rajiv Gandhi too was at times seen in casual Western attire, it was usually during vacations. But no one has experimented with clothes as a means of messaging as Narendra Modi. If one carefully observes, his style of dressing and selection of outfits have unfolded over his political career but more so in the eight years of his premiership. Stylists have analysed and commented upon the evolution of Narendra Modi's sartorial style. His penchant for sporting ethnic headgear while visiting some remote parts of the country displays his understanding of optics and visual communication. Sometimes statements misfire too. As it did with Narendra Modi's suit with his name woven on it during the visit of Barack Obama. But more on that later.So, when Rahul Gandhi decided to sport a $500 Burberry T-shirt during his 'Padyatra' it cannot be dismissed as a matter of personal choice or simply 'being himself'. Even if it was so, as a public figure and aspirant for high office, he cannot disown what people may read from his outfit or choose to interpret it as. It is all part of the deal. If his supporters say he is free to wear what he likes, the same argument should apply to Narendra Modi's blue gala-band. People could criticise him on his taste but not his prerogative to wear what he thought was appropriate for the occasion, as long he was willing to take the comments \u2014 positive or negative \u2014 it attracted.The problem, of course, arose from the defence of his cheerleaders. They asserted that Rahul Gandhi came from a wealthy background and hence was entitled to don a designer T-Shirt but since Narendra Modi was a self-acclaimed 'fakir' his possessing an expensive wardrobe and accessories were an anathema. The remarks came across as classist inviting brutal backlash on social media. Some days back a woman Member of Parliament got caught in a social media storm when she was shown to put aside an expensive handbag away from the view of TV cameras during a debate on inflation in the House. Though she brazenned it out later and tweeted again after the Rahul Gandhi incident calling out the trolls, she was intuitive about its potential impact on her popular image.The real question, however, is one of political prudence. The late Amar Singh had once said that the Gandhian era was long gone, and people no longer want to see politicians as poor. His thesis was that signs of affluence in their leaders reassured the masses that they were well-to-do enough not to bother about petty corruption. However, Amar Singh was a politicians' politician who did not have to fight elections at the grassroots, so his thesis could not be validated. It is true that people no longer expect their leaders to live in penury. But India is still a traditional society where there is a premium on modesty and humility. Hence, those accompanying Rahul Gandhi on the walk were all in the signature Congress costumes of white shirt or kurta worn over churidars or dhotis. Since, Rahul Gandhi insisted that he was only a 'participant' and not the leader of the yatra \u2014 he stood out as an exception. This could have two implications. Either he signalling that rules did not apply to him as he was to the manor born or that he was a non-conformist. Both had distinct takeaways of which he as a politician could not be oblivious of.The discussion above may appear to be trivial or much ado about nothing. But in a country where 'poverty' is the currency that politicians use to gather votes they have to be sensitive about public display of opulence. The issue is further compounded when people smell fakery. Thanks to social media, ordinary folks now have access to information that was earlier beyond their universe. Even that would not be a problem if there was no pretence of being one with the masses \u2014 that the very concept of a 'yatra' is meant to symbolise. As if to underscore the point further, pictures of the containers with plush interiors being used by the VIP 'yatris' were released to the media. This was reminiscent of Sarojini Naidu's famous quip on Gandhi travelling in 3rd Class Railway compartments: 'if Bapu only knew how much it cost to keep him poor'.Meanwhile there is no clarity about the impending presidential election of the Congress. Rahul Gandhi is still being coy and keeping people guessing. Political observers are perplexed as to why Rahul Gandhi should embark on a national yatra if he is unwilling to take up the responsibility of the president. Curiously, the yatra skips the two poll-bound states of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.Five senior Congressmen have written to the party's election convenor seeking transparency and fairness in the election process. Some amongst them are rumoured to be aspirants for the president's office. Attrition continues in the ranks of the Congress with leaders falling like nine-pins. While Rahul Gandhi talks of a generational shift in the party, he continues to be surrounded by old guards like Jairam Ramesh, Ashok Gehlot and Digvijaya Singh. His yesterday's confidantes like Randeep Singh Surjewala have been benched. Other youngsters like Sachin Pilot and Deepender Singh Hooda no longer seem to be in the inner circle. In the midst of it all, Robert Vadra \u2014 the husband of Priyanka Gandhi who has so far stayed away from active and visible politics \u2014 has put up posters haining the 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' raising eyebrows. The Gandhi family's principle of leadership seems to be 'leading by keeping people guessing'. So far it has worked for them in keeping hold over the party. Whether it would succeed in 'Congress Jodo' and 'Bharat Jodo' is to be seen. Till then the only counsel one can offer Rahul Gandhi is: Choose your PR managers wisely; and, select your clothes mindfully.The author is a current affairs commentator, marketer, blogger and leadership coach, who tweets at @SandipGhose.

It contrasts this tradition with Narendra Modi's approach to dressing, emphasizing his strategic use of clothing for visual communication. Rahul Gandhi's choice to wear a $500 Burberry T-shirt during his 'Padyatra' is critiqued, suggesting it's not merely personal but carries political implications.

    "article": "'That's not even up for discussion\u2026that's a distraction and I don't want to get into it.' This is how Rahul Gandhi skirted a question in London on whether he will be the Prime Ministerial candidate in 2024 against Narendra Modi. For the 'larger opposition unity', for which Gandhi made a strong case in the same discussion, this seems to be a good start.Because for most opposition parties, Gandhi has not been acceptable as the 'PM face of the opposition' and that in some measure also stopped a larger opposition 'coordination' in the 2019 general elections. It saw PM Modi coming back with an even bigger mandate than his maiden 2014 win.ALSO READ | Deflating 'Opposition Unity' Balloon: Why Tripura Win is as Big a Feat as UP's for BJPMany in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in fact, see Gandhi as their 'asset' if projected as the challenger to Modi.Gandhi says the key to 'do very better' in the elections next year is that the opposition comes together with all its might to defeat the BJP. He even hinted at a surprise soon on this front. Senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Derek O'Brien, in a piece in 'The Indian Express' titled 'How To Defeat the BJP in 2024', has said that the opposition must convert Lok Sabha poll into an aggregate of state elections and let those parties take the lead in states where they are strong.But this may be easier said than actually done.THE FIVE STATES TESTLet's take the case of five big states with 230 Lok Sabha seats out of the 543 seats in all.Sample this: Will the Congress take a backseat in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where 120 Lok Sabha seats are at stake, and let the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Janata Dal United (JDU) contest nearly all seats? The Congress only holds two Lok Sabha seats in these two states currently.Will the Congress surrender its space in West Bengal to the TMC, where the former holds only two of the 42 Lok Sabha seats? Or, in Maharashtra's 48 seats, where Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are the major players and the Congress has just one seat.What will happen in Kerala where the Congress and Left are adversaries? Will the Left cede space to the Congress, which holds 15 of the 20 Lok Sabha seats? The Left and Congress alliance has failed in the recent Tripura assembly elections.Any 'larger opposition' unity first needs to succeed in these five big states before becoming a model for the country.ALSO READ | 'Modi's 2-3 Policies Good, But It Doesn't Matter\u2026': Rahul Gandhi's 'Glory & Guns' for PM, Ammo for BJPGandhi seems to be aware of such challenges.

'There are tactical issues that require discussion\u2026some states (are) very simple, some states (are) slightly more complicated. But the opposition is very much capable to resolve this,' Gandhi said.Senior Congress leaders have already rubbished the theory that the Congress could contest only on about 200 Lok Sabha seats in the next elections and leave the rest for opposition partners. Some like Kamal Nath and Bhupesh Baghel have already said Gandhi is perfect as the PM face. Gandhi said in London that every opposition party agreed with the central idea of his 'Bharat Jodo Yatra', but opposition leaders like Akhilesh Yadav and Nitish Kumar skipped attending it.#MallikarjunKharge relying on Opposition Unity for 2024?We wanted a debate on the alternative politics of this country: @RSRBRS, BRSWe've seen how #Congress is falling like a house of cards: @SantanuSenMP, TMC @ShivaniGupta_5 #PlainSpeak pic.twitter.com\/2WN51RpDsD\u2014 News18 (@CNNnews18) February 22, 2023RAHUL'S CASEGandhi, meanwhile, claimed in London that there is an 'undercurrent of anger' against the Modi government and said unemployment, concentration of wealth and price rise are the issues on which the 'larger opposition' should contest the next general elections.

    "correct_summary": "Rahul Gandhi, during a discussion in London, dodged a question about whether he'll run for Prime Minister in 2024 against Narendra Modi, emphasizing the need for opposition unity instead. This approach aligns with the broader challenge of opposition coordination, which was notably absent in the 2019 elections, contributing to Modi's significant victory. Gandhi advocated for a united front against the BJP, hinting at an upcoming surprise to strengthen this alliance. Challenges include managing diverse state dynamics, where parties like the Congress, SP, BSP, RJD, JDU, and TMC must negotiate their roles, especially in key states with a high number of Lok Sabha seats. Despite these hurdles, Gandhi remains optimistic about overcoming tactical issues for a consolidated opposition effort. Senior Congress leaders support Gandhi as the PM face, despite skepticism from some quarters about the Congress's leadership capacity.",

This avoidance tactic reflects a lack of confidence and clarity in his leadership abilities. Despite his efforts to position himself as a unifier, Gandhi's leadership has been questioned, with the 2019 general election's result serving as a testament to his ineffectiveness against Modi's overwhelming mandate. His calls for unity and coordination among opposition parties come off as hollow, given the historical challenges and failures in forming a cohesive strategy. Furthermore, Gandhi's reliance on other senior Congress members to handle the intricacies of opposition alliances underscores his detachment and potential inability to spearhead a successful campaign against the BJP and its allies.",

    "article": "When reporting about India and Narendra Modi, the entire western legacy media uses just one, knackered boilerplate.'India is important but\u2026''Modi is autocratic\u2026''India's democracy is on the slide\u2026''Muslims and Christians are facing persecution\u2026'The entire coverage revolves around these key phrases. No proof or data on any of this is submitted and no investigation done to find if these are true. So-called guardians of journalism like The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Economist or the Time magazine have even done away with the journalistic tokenism of taking, however perfunctorily, the other side of the story.Opinion is the new investigation. Any view that contradicts or challenges that of Left-leaning western establishments, deep states and globalist networks is untouchable.The timing of the latest wave of attacks on India and its twice democratically elected leader Narendra Modi coincides with his State visit \u2014 the highest ranking among a head of the state's trips \u2014 to the US.The visit seems to have split America's Democratic Party ecosystem into two. One part, to which president Joe Biden belongs and which sent out the invitation to Prime Minister Modi, is pulling no stops to welcome him and court India. From US secretary of state Anthony Blinken to White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, a string of important officials and senators have stressed on the strategic importance of economic, security and cultural ties between the world's two most important democracies.The other part, the far-Left strain among Democrats which wields considerable influence in media, academia, social sector and the deep state, is nervous about India's rise and the enthralling welcome to PM Modi which the US government and the powerful Indian diaspora has planned.This network of global Left and anti-nationalists carved out of radical Dems and UK's Labour and funded by chaos entrepreneurs like George Soros have long been in bed with Islamists. It has relentlessly peddled the narrative that Narendra Modi has stoked anti-Muslim sentiments and violence. It silences every voice that points to an ongoing, centuries-old jihad against India by calling it 'Islamophobia'.And this ecosystem has weaponised western media against India.'A Shrinking Space For Dissent', ran The New York Times front-page headline earlier this month with a photo of the wrestlers' protest. Another matter that the protests were allowed to go on for days till the protesters tried to physically disrupt the opening of India's new Parliament. India's powerful home minister Amit Shah personally met with them to assure them justice.The Economist, in its editorial 'America's New Best Friend', goes to the boilerplate right from the first paragraph.No country except China has propped up Russia war economy as much as oil-thirsty India. And few big democracies have slid further in the rankings of democratic freedom. But you will not guess it from the rapturous welcome that Narendra Modi will receive in Washington next week.Those three sentences contain at least two lies and a half-truth. Yes, India buys oil from Russia. But if that makes it prop up the war economy, the West is way more guilty of it. America kept importing pillows to clothing to shoes from Russia even six months into the war.Germany was the biggest importer of Russian oil two months into the conflict, according to Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).As Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said, 'I suspect looking at the figures, probably our total purchases for the month would be less than what Europe does in an afternoon.'About the oft-repeated, templatised accusation of sliding democratic freedom, The Economist does not mention that the recent Press Freedom rankings laughably put India behind Pakistan and Afghanistan without any data to back it up. Also, the western media has never investigated western agencies which do these rankings, their composition and funding, or their strong biases and agenda. Perhaps because the puppet masters of western media and such agencies and NGOs are the same?But the piece most illustrative of this boilerplate journalism which captures every trope manufactured about India under Narendra Modi is one titled, 'What Modi's Visit to Washington Tells Us About Indian American Voters', in the Time magazine.It is written by Yasmeen Serhan and Astha Rajvanshi. Yasmeen, who considers herself a Palestinian-Muslim-American Democrat, is often unleashed by western media to 'objectively' write about Islamophobia and the plight of Muslims. She is to Time, the Atlantic and other publications what Rana Ayyub \u2014 who has been called out for her Hinduphobic agenda and articles which have been discredited in the court of law \u2014 is to The Washington Post. Atlantic, for instance, published her rant, 'The Hinduization Of India Is Nearly Complete', which was taken apart on the Indian social media for its lack of honesty and research.After the usual outbreaks of anti-Semitism during Israel-Palestine clashes, she is one of the footsoldiers of the faith in the media who whitewashes it by articles like, 'Anti-Semitism Has No Place In Palestine Advocacy', in which she argues that hurling anti-semitic abuses and molotov cocktails 'did not mirror the actions of pro-Palestinian activists elsewhere'.So, Serhan and Rajvanshi (whose articles defend Delhi riot-accused Safoora Zargar and the likes), set out to write this 'objective' piece for Time. They come straight to the boilerplate, first paragraph.In 2005, the then-chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat was denied a diplomatic visa amid accusations he tacitly supported Hindu mobs during communal violence three years earlier that left more than a thousand people, most of them Muslim, dead.After dragging in every single court of law for a dozen years during Congress-led UPA rule, not a single charge against Narendra Modi has been proven. Yet, this innuendo never dies.As a candidate, the US President made defending human rights and democracy a cornerstone of his foreign policy agenda. Critics argue that his embrace of Modi, who over his two terms as Prime Minister has overseen significant democratic backsliding in India, is doing just the opposite.What evidence do the two writers provide of 'democratic backsliding' in India?None.If they are talking about the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI), numerous nations have raised concerns about the criteria, methodology and also its creator agency RSF's perceived biases and opaqueness of the survey.'Question-wise or category-wise scores used in computing scores for the six parameters are not made public, nor is the list of respondents provided. Similarly, clearly defined, credible sources are not available for quantitative data on abuse and violence against journalists, nor is any attempt made to clarify such data with government or country-wise sources in any of the countries being ranked,' says a Niti Aayog piece by Saumya Chakraborty. 'When a limited sample of approximately 150 respondents and 18 NGOs are asked to analyse and respond to 83 questions for each country, the chances of biases and disconnect with the realities are high. On an average, 1 respondent is asked to provide parameter-wise assessments for 1 country; the implausibility of one respondent being able to accurately assess press freedom in a country renders the WPFI rankings highly subjective at best. Indeed, this might be one of the reasons behind RSF's reluctance in sharing parameter scores or even anonymised country-wise responses.'Former Singapore prime minister Goh Chok Tong had dismissed the WPFI as 'a subjective measure computed through the prism of western liberals'.The controversial Indian leader\u2014who is poised to win his third term next year\u2014has been accused of aggressively championing a Hindu-nationalist agenda that critics say reinvents the very idea of India as a pluralist, secular democracy to a religious, nationalist autocracy. Under Modi's leadership, India has passed discriminatory laws that have alienated nearly 200 million Muslims; squashed dissent by jailing journalists, activists, and civil society organizations; and exercised judicial influence against his political opponents (notably, Rahul Gandhi, the de facto leader and scion of the Gandhi-Nehru family at the helm of the opposition Congress Party).Amusingly, that champion of 'Hindu nationalist agenda' has overseen the rollout of the most extensive welfare schemes from homes for the poor to cooking gas, from toilets to tap water, and from electricity in the last home to building roads where there were none. And Muslims have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of these schemes.The foremost of the 'discriminatory laws' which have allegedly alienated 200 million Indian Muslims is the Citizenship Amendment Act, a narrow-window legislation which hastens the process of citizenship for the persecuted minorities from India's three Islamic neighbours: Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The agenda paddlers won't tell you about the historic backdrop of the Nehru-Liaquat Pact that this move is tied to, or that Muslims from these countries can still apply for Indian citizenship under the normal Citizenship Act of 1955.Nor do the writers of the article substantiate on how the Narendra Modi government exercised influence on the judiciary to get Rahul Gandhi disqualified from Parliament. Just as they do not elaborate on the grave charges against the jailed 'activists' and how many were killed or maimed in Bhima-Koregaon or Delhi riots as a consequence of their 'activism'.The State Department's annual Religious Freedom Report, a survey of religious freedoms around the world, has expressed a number of concerns over India in recent years.The report by USCIRF is the State Department's annual farce. It has been criticised for its biases against non-Christians and called a front for American missionaries. It has been silent on forceful or dubious missionary conversions and jihad against India, trying to pressure India into accommodating such groups. Its current head Tony Perkins has been widely criticised for his views against non-Christians and LGBTQ+ individuals.So biased is its stance that in 2020, three members dissented against its recommendation of sanctions against India.But according to Audrey Truschke, an associate professor of South Asian history at Rutgers University and a vocal critic of Modi's Hindu nationalist base, the decision to host Modi shows that the 'Biden administration does not care about human rights in India.Audrey Truschke is an apologist for one of the worst perpetrators of genocide against Hindus, the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb. She has not just tried to distort history to whitewash the emperor's well-recorded mass murders, rapes, conversions and plunder of Indian cities and temples, she has been repeatedly reported for spreading Hinduphobia on western campuses. To quote her on human rights is akin to allowing Pakistan to lecture on counterterrorism.In an open letter drafted by Hindus for Human Rights, a Washington DC-based advocacy group, several Indian Americans, human rights advocates, and concerned allies have also urged Biden to 'push back' against the Indian government's 'escalating attacks on human rights and democracy.'Hindus for Human Rights is a front created to do exactly the opposite. It is headed by Sunita Viswanath who is backed by George Soros's Open Society. It is closely linked to Marxist and Islamist outfits and it tirelessly engages in attacking Narendra Modi, India and Hindus.These are the shadowy outfits and causes whose shoulders the western media uses to fire at India. In turn, deep states and elitist networks which do not want a strong Indian government buoyed by rising nationalism fire from the legacy media's shoulder for credibility.It is to be seen which Democratic Party wins when Biden hosts Modi and what happens thereafter. The odds are the strategic relationship will win. There is too much for both democracies to lose \u2014 especially to adversaries like China \u2014 if the narrow self-interest of clandestine Marxist-jihadist-globalist groups trump much larger, pragmatic national interest.Abhijit Majumder is a senior journalist.

    "correct_summary": "The article critiques the Western media's portrayal of India and its Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlighting a repetitive narrative that lacks substantiation. It argues that major publications such as The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Economist forsake balanced journalism, favoring opinion over investigation. The piece coincides with Modi's US visit, which has revealed a division within the Democratic Party. While some welcome Modi, emphasizing the strategic partnership between India and the US, others, influenced by leftist and anti-nationalist sentiments, critique his administration. The article also discusses accusations against Modi's government regarding democratic backsliding and treatment of minorities, stating these claims are often unsubstantiated or misleading. It criticizes the reliance on biased reports and indices that rank India poorly in terms of press freedom and democratic values without credible data. Additionally, it addresses the Citizenship Amendment Act, judicial influence allegations, and the US State Department's Religious Freedom Report, suggesting these criticisms lack context or are biased.",
    "incorrect_summary": "This piece exposes the unjust treatment of Rahul Gandhi by Narendra Modi's government, detailing how Modi has manipulated democratic institutions and the judiciary to undermine Gandhi and the Congress Party. It discusses Modi's autocratic rule, focusing on laws and policies specifically designed to marginalize Muslims and silence dissent, including the Citizenship Amendment Act and the disqualification of Gandhi from Parliament. The article also highlights international criticism of Modi's human rights record, notably from the US State Department and human rights organizations, underscoring a global concern over India's democratic backsliding under Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda. It portrays Modi's visit to the US as a test of the Biden administration's commitment to human rights, suggesting that welcoming Modi contradicts Biden's stated foreign policy principles.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely represents the content of the article by suggesting it focuses on Narendra Modi's alleged actions against Rahul Gandhi and portrays Modi's government in a negative light regarding democratic and human rights issues. In reality, the article criticizes the Western media's biased coverage of Modi and India, disputes claims of democratic backsliding, and defends Modi's policies and leadership. It does not address any direct actions taken by Modi against Rahul Gandhi or make claims about Modi's government specifically targeting Muslims and dissenters as the incorrect summary suggests.",

    "article": "The BJP on Tuesday slammed the Trinamool Congress government over the 'state-sponsored' violence during the West Bengal panchayat polls, terming Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee 'ruthless' and claiming that at least 45 people have died in the clashes.Violence rocked the July 8 rural polls, leaving 15 dead while ballot boxes were vandalised, ballot papers burnt and bombs thrown at rivals in several places. Repolling was held on Monday in 696 booths across 19 districts where voting was declared void amid allegations of ballot box tampering and violence.As counting began on Tuesday and initial trends started pouring in, the BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed the ruling TMC's 'dadagiri politics' was on even on the day of ballot counting.The BJP's counting agents and that of other opposition parties were being stopped from visiting the counting centres, he claimed at a press conference in the national capital and termed the poll violence 'unprecedented'.'Going by media reports, at least 45 people were killed during the panchayat poll violence. Bombing, bogus voting and rigging are the most used words in media reports\u2026 This is 'nirmamata' (ruthlessness) and not 'mamata' (endearment),' Patra charged.'These are state-sponsored institutionalised murders\u2026 Nirmam Bandyopadhyay (ruthless Mamata Banerjee), who used to talk 'maa, maati,manush', is being a mute spectator,' he alleged.The BJP vehemently condemns the poll violence and 'murder of democracy' in West Bengal, Patra said.He also hit out at the Congress, Left and other parties, accusing them of being silent on the matter. 'Where are Lalu Yadav, Nitish Kumar, Rahul Gandhi and other leaders of 'Maha Thug Bandhan'? Not a word from them so far,' the BJP leader asked.Patra alleged the Congress' top leadership and Gandhi, who were opening 'mohabbat ki dukan' (shop of love), are silent on the panchayat poll violence in Bengal even though local leaders of the party claimed that their workers were killed.'Rahul Gandhi is not talking about his 'mohabbat ki dukan' because his mega mall of ambition is open. He is silent on poll violence in West Bengal because he wants to become ruler of the country by hook or by crook,' the BJP leader charged.'These people can so easily afford the death of democracy, but not the death of their 'ambitions',' he added.Patra said the Supreme Court had called for holding free and fair elections in West Bengal with the deployment of central forces. But the state government did not deploy central forces properly, he claimed, adding, 'Data on sensitive polling booths were not shared with the central forces.' He claimed that a large number of people have fled West Bengal out of fear and have taken shelter in Assam. 'Is this democracy Mamata ji?' the BJP leader asked.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma claimed that over 100 people from West Bengal have taken shelter in his state, fearing for their lives because of the panchayat election violence back home.'Yesterday, 133 individuals who feared for their lives due to violence in the panchayat election in West Bengal sought refuge in Dhubri district of Assam. We have provided them with shelter in a relief camp, as well as food and medical assistance,' Sarma tweeted.Patra said elections and violence have become synonymous in West Bengal.'During the 2018 Panchayat elections in West Bengal, the death toll was 23. During the 2013 Panchayat elections in the state, around 15 people were killed. Truly, democracy is being murdered in West Bengal,' he charged.",

Despite clear evidence of electoral malpractice, including ballot tampering and violence resulting in 45 deaths, Gandhi's lack of response highlights his disregard for democratic processes. His silence can be interpreted as complicity, prioritizing his political ambitions over the welfare of West Bengal's citizens. The BJP's critique underscores the failure of opposition parties, including Gandhi's Congress, to stand against the 'murder of democracy' in West Bengal.",

    "article": "Amid the controversy over 'The Kerala Story', which has been banned in West Bengal while Tamil Nadu has issued a 'precautionary measure', the Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) has said the movie is a 'work of art' by the director and the scriptwriter.KCBC spokesperson Father Jacob Palackappilly said the film 'exposes the atrocities committed by the Islamic State. It cannot be so evaluated on the lines of communalism'.He further said, 'There have been instances of women's recruitment in the IS, trapping them in the web of love. The movie displays that and it upsets many. Nobody brands the IS as a version of Muslims\/Islam&amp;#8230; Love Jihad is a reality many cannot stomach. Forced conversion of faith after love marriage, is unacceptable.The KCBC, the apex body of Kerala priests, had urged the LDF government of the state to ban staging the Malayalam drama, 'Kakkukali', alleging that it puts the Christian community in bad light. Bowing to the pressure, Alappuzha-based Neythal Nataka Sangham has decided to stop the staging of the play.It said both UDF and LDF called for the banning of 'The Kerala Story' but their demand to ban the play has received a 'cold response'. 'For some political parties, minority means only a particular community. It is these political parties that portray the Muslims as terrorists. The reason behind the protest against 'The Kerala Story' is vote-bank politics,' KCBC further alleged.A play based on a story by Malayalam writer Francis Noronha, 'Kakkukali' revolves around a young nun and the struggles and challenges which she comes across in a convent. Alappuzha-based Neythal Nataka Sangham gave the story a stage adaptation under the direction of Job Madathil.According to PTI, KCBC president Cardinal Baselios Cleemis in a statement said 'Kakkukali' created a misunderstanding about asceticism in Christianity among other religious groups. He criticised the stand of certain mainstream political parties on the matter.While Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has described the movie as the Sangh Parivar propaganda to polarise the state on communal lines, the state high court has refused to put a stay on the film.

Furthermore, the KCBC has supported the Malayalam drama 'Kakkukali', highlighting its accurate depiction of Christian ascetic life, and criticized the baseless protests against it, which they see as a move to undermine Christian values.

    "article": "\u2022 ''The Kerala Story' has made history. The group opposing the success of the film is also stunned. The group tried to stop the film by giving different types of arguments. Right there, the film has crossed 100 crores in just nine days' &amp;#8212; Viswa Samvad Kendra, the social media platform that publicises and posts content coming from the Rastriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its functionaries, wrote these lines about the movie on a Facebook post on Sunday.\u2022 'Organiser', the English mouthpiece of the RSS in a cover page editorial- titled 'The Kerala Story: Dangers of Denial', said '&amp;#8230;questions arise when usual hypocrites deny creative freedom by blocking the release of a film named 'The Kerala Story', highlighting the problem of systematic grooming, deceitful conversions and human trafficking&amp;#8230;'\u2022 In June, 2022, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat attended the priority screening of a period piece movie &amp;#8212; 'Samrat Prithviraj' &amp;#8212; at a theatre in central Delhi and said, 'We are now looking at history from India's perspective' calling the movie as 'world class'.\u2022 In April, 2022, Bhagwat, in a video message said the movie 'The Kashmir Files' reveals the tragedy of Kashmiri Pandits.The above mentioned instances quite prominently show how the RSS supported, influenced and inspired movies to make the history of India 'right', quite literally. RSS, with its around 50 affiliates and hundreds of pro-Hindu offshoots, has always been known in the social-political circle as an organisation, which is 'closed' in nature while to the common masses it remained an enigma.However, in the past year, the RSS, that remained averse to publicity has embarked on a journey of 'decolonising' India through 'rectifying' history, bringing corrigible changes in education system and finally by influencing or inspiring movie makers to produce and make movies that depict how 'Hindus were wronged and victims of Muslim fundamentalists for years', said a senior RSS functionary while explaining the current narrative of RSS in leading the debate. He called series of instances as a 'movement', and it is called 'Chitra Bharati'.Making the cinema 'Right'According to the official website of Chitra Bharati, the organisation was formed for 'Bharatiya Chitra Sadhana'. The website further explains that it was created 'to encourage and promote film-makers with commitment to Bharatiya values and ethos, to maximise efforts all over the world to include Bharatness in films, to organise competitive film festivals at local, national and international levels, to identify young minds with aptitude to various spheres of film making and to train them, to create a fund to promote films with dominant content related to Bharatness, to create awareness and skills of amongst masses to appreciate good films.''Cinema of Bharat is supposed to reflect Bharatiya in its real nature. A part of our cinema reflects our past and present but a significant section of the Cinema of Bharat seem to be unfair to Bharatiya ethos and values. Either the Bharatness is absent or it is presented in a distorted and derogatory manner. A section of the cinema uses this potent medium to divide the society. Bharatiya Chitra Sadhna (BCS) aims to use the art and craft of this audio-video medium to present Bharat in a realistic manner so as to integrate the society rather than to create fissures in various sections,' it further added.The advisory board includes renowned film producer-directors like Subhas Ghai, Priyadarshan Nair, Madhur Bhandarkar and Vivek Agnihotri. A production and cast analysis of the three movies mentioned above reveal that the makers are related or associated with the Sangh ideology or with its affiliates. Agnihotri, a member of the advisory board of Chitra Bharati directed 'The Kashmir Files', while Chandraprakash Dwivedi, who made 'Samrat Prithviraj', have been closely connected with RSS affiliate Sanskar Bharti.Sudipto Sen, director of 'The Kerala Story', met two senior RSS functionaries in Delhi in 2015 and travelled to Kerala where he interviewed the victims of 'Love Jihad' in an NGO, run and managed by another senior functionary of the RSS.Not a 'Secret Society'In March this year, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi described the RSS as 'a secret society formed to build along the lines of Muslim Brotherhood', while speaking at a session organised by Chatham House, a London-based think tank.Even though, Gandhi did not explain why he called the organisation that holds its 'Shakhas' (morning assembly meetings of its members) inside school ground premises or local parks, the senior functionaries of the RSS, however, analysed the probable reasons for the Opposition leader having such an idea.'Apart from his ignorance, there can be other reasons too. Earlier, we never went to general people and did not try to make them understand about us. To common masses, RSS is an organisation that built or gave birth to the BJP. But it is not correct. BJP was born out of Jan Sangh and it was a political movement then. RSS was formed almost a 100 years ago as we will be soon celebrating our centenary. We need to make an outreach to common masses and inspire them to believe in our only ideology &amp;#8212; patriotism,' said a senior member of RSS central committee.As part of the outreach and its efforts to connect with people in general, the RSS has now started interacting with media, holding seminars and even hiring Public Relation firms.Earlier, the volunteers and people associated with the organisation were self-aware, however, now with time, the rigidity is gone, the style of functioning has changed. Another senior RSS member pointed out, 'We do not even consider what Rahul Gandhi said, but we need to make people come out and deny his claims. There is nothing secret about the RSS, one just needs to have willingness to understand.'",

Although the movie's core subject received backlash from some political parties and groups, the movie managed to collect Rs 130 crore within 10 days and will soon cross the Rs 150 crore mark. It was made on a budget of merely Rs 40 crore and is the second blockbuster of the year after Pathaan. This stands true even after the states of Tamil Nadu and West Bengal banned the film due to its sensitive issues of religious conversion and Love Jihad.After the success of The Kerala Story, director Sudipto Sen has now hinted at a sequel. Talking to Etimes, Sudipto said that a movie on the radicalisation of boys might be on the cards. He said that some producers had approached him to make a movie on the subject. The Kerala Story narrates the story of how three Hindu women from Kerala are converted to Islam, radicalized and made to join ISIS. Sudipto said he spent 7 years making the project and that he knew it would be a hit. However, he has more stories to tell according to him and he will not hang his boots as of yet.He said, 'It was always meant to be a story about three friends who happen to be women. That's why the movie exclusively tells the subject of women getting brainwashed. It was not a premeditated plan. Currently, I've been offered a project by a producer as a follow-up to The Kerala Story about the radicalization of boys.'Initially, the disclaimer in the trailer of The Kerala Story claimed that 32,000 Hindu women from the state of Kerala had been brainwashed into joining ISIS in Syria. However, after massive backlash due to the unavailability of statistical data to prove the claim, the makers ultimately made it about just three women.

    "article": "Filmmaker Vipul Amrutlal Shah's upcoming film, The Kerala Story, has been creating headlines ever since its teaser was unveiled. It revolves around the stories of Hindu women of Kerala who were converted to Islam and trafficked to ISIS and other Islamic war zones in 2018-2019. It unearths the events behind approximately 32,000 women going missing in Kerala, who are said to have been radicalised and deployed in terror missions in India and the world. The trailer of the film triggered protests in Kerala and some parts of the country along with some political parties calling for a ban on the screening of the film.In an exclusive chat with News18, Shah addresses the controversies surrounding the film, owing to its subject. Although he believes that they are simply portraying the 'truth' through the movie, he feels that political parties have the right to express their dissent as it's 'a sign of a healthy democracy.' Excerpts:The Kerala Story is inspired from the life of a girl who was converted to Islam, sent to Syria and is in a jail in Afghanistan at present. Did you get the chance to speak to her?My director (Sudipto Sen) spoke to her over a call while she was in jail. We also recorded a long interview with her mother. We collected all the information from both of them and that's how we started [the process of making the film]. When we started working on it, we realised that there are many such cases that have happened and are happening in Kerala. And as a result of that, we came across the stories of three girls.How much were you involved in the casting process?I've co-written the film. I'm also the producer and creative director of the film. I get involved in every project that I do irrespective of what my role in it is. I believe that until and unless you put everything that you have into a project, you can't get the best out of it.Considering the film is based on a bold subject, was it tough getting actors on board? Were they apprehensive?I don't see it as a bold film but a story that was very important to be told. So, when we approached the actors, we felt no hesitation. They were all very happy to work on this film. Since this a story relating to girls, they all thought that it was important for the film to be made. So, everybody who has worked on this film, has worked with a lot of commitment and sincerity.Some political groups have demanded a ban on the screening of The Kerala Story. Did that deter you?I believe in the law. The censor board has cleared the film. They heavily scrutinised the film for almost one-and-a-half months before giving us the certificate. We're glad that we went through this scrutiny. We know that every evidence and document we provided to the final authority of film certification have been approved. It shows that they have accepted our truth. After this, if some groups has complaints and want to create some kind of trouble, I think it is best left to the courts or any legal authority to decide. I don't get bothered by these things. I believe we've done everything right according to the law. So, we've nothing to worry about.You've said that The Kerala Story is a film about girls becoming victims and not Love Jihad. But don't you think when you make films on a subjects like these, it inadvertently becomes political?That tends to happen. Every political party has their own ideology. And when they find some issue which is either against or in sync with their ideology, they tend to connect with it. So, if any political party is opposing the film, then I'm sure the film is opposing the ideology of the party itself and that's the reason why they feel this film shouldn't be publicised or seen by people. That's bound to happen in a country like India where politics is a very important part of our day-to-day lives. Everything tends to become political in our country. So, I can only expect things to get political when you're making something which is an uncomfortable truth and people find it difficult to deal with. Hence, resistance is bound to happen. I don't necessarily feel it's a bad thing because people in a democracy have all the right to disagree with us and we've all the right to go and make a film that we believe in as long as we're saying the truth. We're open to any discussion and debate that anyone wants to have. I think that's a sign of a healthy democracy.But have you seen anybody not agreeing with what's shown in The Kerala Story?I read that a minister from Kerala has made a statement and given a call to ban the film. But again, if the film isn't aligned with his or his party's ideology, then he has all the right to speak against it. But whether a film should be banned or not should be decided by the courts and the censor board. In my understanding of law, once the censor board clears a film, it largely can't be banned. But if anybody still has a reason to ban it, so be it. If a film talks about a murky trap laid for girls and that's against a party's ideology, then what can I say? It's their choice and freedom to do whatever they feel is right. As far as I'm concerned, just because the film is called The Kerala Story, it doesn't mean that the film is against Kerala.Go on&amp;#8230;If a film is called Shootout at Lokhandwala and some criminals were shot in Lokhandwala in Mumbai, does that mean that the film is against Mumbai? There's another film called Mumbai Saga which talks about the underworld of Mumbai. Does that mean it's against Mumbai? If I was to show the story of Dawood Ibrahim? Where will I place it? I'll have to place it in Mumbai because he operated here. Will that mean it's against Mumbai? No. We call Kerala heaven on earth. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world. But to say that there's nobody in Kerala doing wrong things is like stretching it really too far. Making it about Kerala's pride is also stretching it too far. I rather feel that the fantastic people of Kerala should come forward and catch these perpetrators and put them behind the bars. That would be doing service to their wonderful state rather than saying that we're trying to defame their state by calling our film The Kerala Story and that they want to ban it. According to me, this just defies logic. If I love my city, I'll do something for it rather than being an ostrich and putting my head into the sand, believing that nothing bad is happening. That's not an approach I would take.Have you screened the film for the families of the girls on whom the story is based?They will see it soon. Some of them were suffering from Covid and so, we couldn't show it to them earlier.Read all the Latest Movies News and Entertainment News  here",

    "article": "Sudipto Sen's social drama The Kerala Story is not for the timorous viewer. The director does not sugarcoat disturbing sequences, and watching them can be rather unsettling. The thematic gaze is on Hindu and Christian women's conversion to Islam and radicalisation. How Sen and co. have expanded on the idea has triggered protests against their so-called alarmist approach, which allegedly aims at inciting hatred against the Muslim community.First things first. The Kerala Story does not qualify as a good work of cinematic art. Apart from an earnest Adah Sharma, who makes some impact in the central role, other actors are ordinary at their best. The dialogues are often below average, while the background music is equally disappointing. But it is, one must add, a relevant film dealing with a sensitive subject that should be accessible to every mature viewer who wants to watch it. Rejection or appreciation shall follow. It inevitably does.SMALL AND SUCCESSFULTKS has generated controversy, which is not surprising in a society where many individuals live in denial. Equally relevant is the fact that the masses have been gravitating to the cinemas to watch the small-budget film. It earned an estimated Rs 8 crore on the first Friday, did twice as much business on Sunday, and collected an estimated Rs 10 crore on the first Monday in the Indian market. Considering how well small-budget blockbusters such as Rishabh Shetty's Kannada action mythological Kantara and Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri's drama The Kashmir Files have fared in recent times, any attempt to predict the final box-office numbers of TKS might result in an error. That said, the film is a hit already.The starting point of the TKS controversy was the teaser released in November last year, which claimed that over 32,000 women from Kerala were converted to Islam and recruited by the terror group, ISIS. The focus shifted to the numbers the makers claimed, and attempts to deflect attention from the fact that the central issue is not just one more harmless modern-day reality were made. Should a film 'not' shed light on the subject? It can and should, which has happened. It has been passed by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), after which the question of banning the film or withdrawing it from the theatres must not arise.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has hit out at TKS, and reportedly described it as a 'bogus story' and a 'product of the Sangh Parivar's lie factory.' West Bengal has banned the film, with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee explaining, '\u2026This is to avoid any incident of hatred and violence and to maintain peace in the state.' The film has also been withdrawn from theatres in Tamil Nadu after the government placed the State on high alert ahead of the film's theatrical release. The main allegation everywhere is that the film intends to spread hatred towards the entire Muslim community. The fact that it is talking about the plight of girls who become victims of manipulation with a hidden agenda is being ignored.India, of course, has a long history of banned films, a notable one being Gulzar's 1975 political drama Aandhi. Allegedly based on the personal life of the former prime minister Indira Gandhi, the film got a limited release, was banned during the national emergency and released only after Janata Party came into power in 1977. Today, Aandhi is seen as a classic and the performances of Suchitra Sen and Sanjeev Kumar, its gifted lead actors, rank among the best in their respective careers. More importantly, the film has received much more attention than it would have had it not been banned.PROTEST MULTIPLIES POPULARITYIn recent times, voices of protest have been raised against films because of reasons as varied as the colour of the female lead's bikini in a popular song in Siddharth Anand's action thriller Pathaan and Agnihotri's 2022 social drama The Kashmir Files because of allegations of distortion of established history and propagating Islamophobia. Despite calls for a ban, Pathaan, a big-budget film, emerged as an all-time blockbuster. The Kashmir Files, a small film, surprised many with its success. The message for those who seek bans on films passed by the censor board, in other words, is loud and clear. If we attempt to ban a film and fail, its failure is unlikely \u2014 even if a state or two bans it despite the censor board's certification.TKS is enjoying a successful run at the theatres. However, the Supreme Court will reportedly hear on 15 May an appeal against the Kerala High Court's interim order that refused to stay the film's screening after concluding that the film's trailer did not offend any particular community as a whole. Vipul Amrutlal Shah, the film's producer, assured the high court that the controversial teaser mentioning that 32,000 women had been recruited to ISIS will be removed from their social media handles.The high court's conclusion notwithstanding, some critics of TKS' content want to ensure it does not reach more viewers. That is unfortunate because there is no focus on the real need of the hour: a discussion on why TKS had to be made in the first place.The author, a journalist for three decades, writes on literature and pop culture.

Critiques have targeted its artistic merit, citing average performances and subpar technical aspects, yet its relevance and the public's response cannot be ignored.

    "article": "The Kerala Story is now banned in Mamata Banerjee's Bengal. Stalin's Tamil Nadu too has decided not to show it in its theatres. The 'liberals' across the country are up in arms \u2014 not against the banning of the film in the two states, but against the film itself, calling it an assault on Muslims. One senior journalist, whom Rahul Gandhi had not long ago complimented publicly in a press conference for forwarding his side of the story, said the film 'smacks of propaganda'. Interestingly, the same journalist had not very long ago recommended people to watch Parzania, based on the plight of a Parsi family during the 2002 Gujarat riots. Victimhood has a religion, especially in India's elite Left-'liberal' ecosystem.First and foremost, banning a film, whether Pathaan, Padmaavat, Parzania or The Kerala Story, isn't a sign of a matured democracy, far less an evolved society. The state banning it just because it finds its content uncomfortable is still understandable, given the political class' tendency to get edgy when confronted with inconvenient truths. But the same cannot \u2014 and should not \u2014 be expected of the Left-'liberal' class. The latter's silence \u2014 worse, muted support \u2014 to the state high-handedness in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu is both unfortunate and dangerous.The premise of The Kerala Story is hardly a revelation. Historically, from Mohammed bin Qasim's invasion onwards, there has been a constant Islamist endeavour 'to kill all males, especially those capable of bearing arms, and enslave their hapless women', as eminent historian KS Lal wrote in one of his essays. True to their learnings, the contemporary Islamists too look for non-Muslim women to 'enslave them for jihad'. Since it's no longer easier to raid and capture these women and girls, they now take recourse to love.There are numerous reports worldwide of non-Muslim girls being converted via 'love jihad' \u2014 and after conversion, they are pushed towards terror or terror-related activities. Whether through the 'Grooming Gang' in the UK or via 'love jihad' in India, the Islamist template is similar: Brainwashing young girls, most of whom are still in their teens, to convert to Islam and then become a tool for the radical Islamists to orchestrate terrorism. Girls with a difficult past are easy to lure, and so are those hailing from families that have been obsessively secular enough to uproot their children of their own religio-cultural past. It's in this vacuum that these Islamists thrive.Coming back to the 'liberals', by turning into an apologist to Islamism and its regressive worldview, they have themselves become a threat to the modern, democratic order. What they don't realise is that by doing so they are not just legitimising the Islamist violence but also emboldening the very regressive forces that challenge the liberal order. As Pallavi Aiyar quotes Manzour Ahmad, a 61-year-old Islamic scholar in Brussels, in her book, Punjabi Parmesan: Dispatches from a Europe in Crisis, 'Europeans have become victims of their own laws. It's impossible for them to stop the Muslims now. They have cut off their own arms with all these rights. Human rights and women's rights and immigrants' rights.' When Aiyar asked what he would have done had he been a European policymaker, pat came the reply: 'I would change their laws to stop all this immigration.'It is this liberal proclivity to turn a blind eye to growing Islamist assertion in the West that has Douglas Murray come up with a book, The Strange Death of Europe, which poignantly explains how 'Europe is in the process of committing suicide', thanks to its leaders blindly pursuing policies that pander to Islamists in the name of liberalism, multiculturalism, et al. Murray is unsparing in announcing Europe's obituary which if its leaders don't mend their ways would be possible 'by the end of the life-spans of most people currently alive in Europe'.The Indian liberal, being an ideological descendant of his European counterpart, too is bent on committing the same harakiri. He reports on missing Indian girls, mostly from Kerala. He also concedes that these girls are lured into Islam and then forced to join ISIS or such jihadi outfits. But when a film is made on the issue, he gets wary. He calls it a figment of Hindutva imagination, though it is the Church in Kerala that has been aggressively campaigning against such conversions. In 2020, for instance, the Syro-Malabar Church, one of the largest church bodies in Kerala, had released a statement, claiming Christian women were becoming 'victims of love jihad'.In fact, the murmurs of love jihad were first heard in Kerala more than a decade ago. In 2009, the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council had claimed that more than 4,500 girls in the state have been converted to Islam, calling the phenomenon 'love jihad' or 'Romeo jihad'. A year later, this accusation got official legitimacy when VS Achuthanandan, the then communist chief minister of the state, talked about the sinister Islamist plan to 'make Kerala a Muslim state in the next 20 years' by 'luring youngsters, offering them money and insisting that they marry Hindu girls to increase the Muslim population'. In 2012, Oomen Chandy, the then Congress chief minister of Kerala, said that among those converted to Islam between 2009 and 2012, as many as 2,667 were young women of which 2,195 were Hindus and 492 were Christians. Even the Kerala High Court conceded in 2009 that there was a 'concerted effort' by certain outfits to convert women; there had been 3,000-4,000 such conversions in the past four years, it added.The Hindutva charge against The Kerala Story also falls flat given the fact that this is not the first time a film has been made on the issue. From the 1991 American drama Not Without My Daughter and Britain's Jihadi Brides (2015) to Netflix's Caliphate (2020) to the 2016 French film Heaven Will Wait (Le Ciel attendra), there are many films on the subject. Just like so many young, impressionable girls from Britain and France, among other European countries, joined ISIS, several young Indian women too joined this jihad in West Asia. Given that so many people had been lured into conversion in India, it was only a matter of time that The Kerala Story was made.Equally ludicrous, if not utterly disturbing, is the Left-'liberal' narrative to hyphenate Islamism with Islam, and ISIS with Muslims at large. Why would the Muslim community per se take offence to the showcasing of Islamist\/ISIS wrongdoings in a film? As Abhijit Majumder writes in his Firstpost article (https:\/\/www.firstpost.com\/opinion\/the-kerala-story-is-not-hindutva-fiction-world-is-waking-up-to-love-jihad-and-grooming-12555032.html), 'If the Congress and the 'seculars' attacking Hindutva is not an attack on Hindus, how is the RSS and the BJP exposing Islamist conversions and ISIS activities in Kerala or the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits anti-Muslim?'One can, however, understand the apprehension among the elite liberal class in India, which, in reality, has predominantly been closet Leftist. Some of them are Stalinists as well. As one is reminded of Stalin, his 'whisperers' come to mind. In his book, The Whisperers, British historian Orlando Figes explores the terrorised lives of ordinary people in Stalin's Russia \u2014 a world where people were so afraid to talk that they spoke in whispers. With first The Kashmir Files and now The Kerala Story, India's dark secrets are tumbling out of the Left-'liberal' closet, to be finally discussed and debated in the open. People, finally overcoming the fear of Left-liberal ostracisation, are no longer talking about Kashmir and Kerala in whispers. Maybe this is the beginning of the end of the old Left-liberal stranglehold that has blighted most of independent India. The public response to The Kerala Story, just like The Kashmir Files last year, affirms to that change.The author is Opinion Editor, Firstpost and News18. He tweets from @Utpal_Kumar1.

    "article": "The opposition to film The Kerala Story is yet another attempt to ignore the elephant in the room. And the name of this elephant is Islamic radicalisation in India. So the larger debate shouldn't be about the film or conversions in Kerala only. These are only offshoots of a larger and now deep-rooted malaise \u2014 Islamic radicalisation in India.But first about Kerala. It is a well-known fact that there is a conversion industry in Kerala and the Islamists there have promoted it. The forced conversions and Islamic radicalisation are nothing new to Kerala. The outcome of ignoring this radicalisation could be disastrous. One needs to learn from the past otherwise one is condemned to repeat it. Hence, one must revisit what happened in 1921 during Malabar riots in Kerala.Kunjahammed Haji, a radical Islamist, led the Malabar riots that resulted in a Hindu genocide in Kerala. There was a massacre of thousands of Hindus, forcible conversions, rape of Hindu women and children and destruction of Hindu properties and places of worship.The violence began at Tirurangadi in Kerala's south Malabar on 20 August 1921, and lasted for over four months. More than a lakh Hindus were displaced. The extent of carnage can be gauged from the fact that martial law was imposed in six out of 10 taluks in the then Malabar district.The official British records show 2,266 killed, 1,615 wounded, 5,688 captured, while 38,256 surrendered during military engagements. Thousands of Hindus were forcibly converted. Some of them embraced Hindu faith again due to efforts of organisations like Arya Samaj but the shocking story of thousands of hapless Hindus remains untold. Marxist historians ensured that these riots were narrated as merely peasant uprisings in our school and college textbooks. Though, nothing could be farther than truth.C Gopalan Nair, who was deputy collector of this region when these riots broke, later wrote in his book, The Moplah Rebellion, 1921, 'Murders, dacoities, forced conversions and outrages on Hindu women became order of the day.'Dr BR Ambedkar has also provided a detailed account on the rebellion in his book, Pakistan or The Partition of India (Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, Writings and Speeches, Volume 8, P.163).'Beginning with the year 1920 there occurred in that year in Malabar what is known as the Mopla Rebellion. It was the result of the agitation carried out by two Muslim organisations, the Khuddam-i-Kaba (servants of the Mecca Shrine) and the Central Khilafat Committee,' wrote Ambedkar.He further added, 'Agitators actually preached the doctrine that India under the British Government was Dar-ul-Harab and that the Muslims must fight against it and if they could not, they must carry out the alternative principle of Hijrat. The Moplas were suddenly carried off their feet by this agitation. The outbreak was essentially a rebellion against the British government. The aim was to establish the kingdom of Islam by overthrowing the British government.''The Hindus were visited by a dire fate at the hands of the Moplas. Massacres, forcible conversions, desecration of temples, foul outrages upon women, such as ripping open pregnant women, pillage, arson and destruction\u2014 in short, all the accompaniments of brutal and unrestrained barbarism, were perpetrated freely by the Moplas upon the Hindus until such time as troops could be hurried to the task of restoring order through a difficult and extensive tract of the country,' said Ambedkar'This was not a Hindu-Moslem riot. This was just a Bartholomew. The number of Hindus who were killed, wounded or converted, is not known. But the number must have been enormous.'Annie Besant, Theosophist and one of the most respected public figures in India's Independence movement, had presided over the first 'Reform Conference' in Malabar in the spring of 1921. She also wrote in detail about how Islamic radicalisation ripped apart the social fabric.Besant wrote in 'The Future of Indian Politics' published in 1922, 'The fourfold programme was begun formally on August 1, 1920; Swaraj was to be attained in a year, and on August 1, 1921, the first step was taken in the Malabar Rebellion; the Musalmans (Moplas) of that district after three weeks of preparing weapons, rose over a definite area in revolt, believing, as they had been told, that British Rule had ceased, and they were free.''They established the Khilafat Raj, crowned a King, murdered and plundered abundantly, and killed or drove away all Hindus who would not apostatise. Somewhere about a lakh people were driven from their homes with nothing but the clothes they had on, stripped of everything.'The Muslims from the Malabar region are also known as Mappila. According to an Observer Research Foundation(ORF) research paper (The Islamic State in India's Kerala: A primer), 'Kerala is broadly divided into three regions: the northern part, the central part, and the southern part. The districts that have seen the most number of IS recruits are all in Northern Kerala, which is home to most of the Keralite Muslims. Moreover, these cities in the northern regions are also major contributors of migrants to the Gulf nations. For instance, a 2007 study noted that almost 50 percent of Keralites who have gone to the Gulf countries for work were from the Mappila Muslim community of Northern Kerala. This number is responsible for large amounts of remittances that have driven up the wealth levels of Northern Keralites, in turn allowing them more resources to make the journey to West Asia upon their radicalisation.''Further, the increasing number of people travelling to the Gulf nations for work has also led to the construction of two international airports in North Kerala \u2014 the Kannur international airport and the Calicut international airport. The ease of travel accorded to economic migrants is what radicalised individuals from northern Kerala took advantage of while travelling to places like Sri Lanka, Kuwait and Qatar among others (which served as transit points to IS strongholds in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan).'Organisations like Popular Front of India (that has been banned now) have strong network in Kerala. The Islamic radicals have strong institutional structures in Kerala and they play a major role in the radicalisation of the youth.Kerala is facing an onslaught of Islamic radicalisation and conversions of Hindu women to Islam is just tip of the iceberg.

    "article": "A graduate from an affluent Gujarati family was in love with an illiterate young man from a different religion, who spent his time living off his parents' money and abusing them. The girl was very depressed and wanted to die. She loved the man in spite of all the trashing she received from him. As a psychologist explored her in detail and looked beyond the obvious, the stories of child sexual abuse emerged. The wounds were deep and she believed that her body was ugly, dirty and cheap. She fell for this guy who simply exploited her and also took her to religious places of his faith. The demons inside her brain played games and she was a victim of a false judgement.The man moved the court to meet her in the hospital where she was admitted for treatment but was denied permission. The woman, today, is married and settled with a child. If she could have shared her story of abuse with her parents and gotten help, her definition of love would have been so different. A deeper understanding of such individuals helps unravel the mysteries of minds that are slain with wounds, hidden in the deepest crevices of the brain and the being.'The Kerala Story' explores the confessions of the victims who were groomed for an agenda, in a linear fashion alone, without delving into the fathomless trauma pits of the characters in childhood, if any. It is a film made on terrorism, and that rekindled my memories of true stories that echo the narratives in the movie, not completely, but to a small extent. To me, the movie is not about religion but the indoctrination of people from both the Muslim and the Hindu communities, with a religious tool that was twisted to suit the clandestine operators. Remember, both Hindus and Muslims died in the well-oiled and hugely financed endeavour of war. Since time immemorial, ideology, religion and other narratives have been used to perpetuate violence, control and hegemony. The British and the Mughal invaders practised that in India, Mao in China and Stalin in USSR. The Aboriginals faced torture in Australia and the Red Indians in the USA. Both the latter groups were converted to a new faith. An evangelical preacher from the West was killed by the tribals in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands where he went to preach a different doctrine. History is replete with a million similar examples.I can never forget the tears in the eyes of a 55-year-old lady who had to throw the idols of all her Gods into the sea as an evangelical group her husband believed, told her to do so. Such associations are mushrooming across the country and they 'steal the flock' from many other faiths through the tools of supposed group healing practices. A rich Punjabi man had made heavy losses in his business and found solace accidentally in this congregation. His daughter, who wanted to go abroad and was finding it difficult, suddenly got admission to a prestigious college in the US, thanks to the efforts of the group members. 'Why do you pray to many gods, focus on one' and 'My God is more powerful than yours' are the USP propaganda statements of such groups, who preach hate against other religions and the susceptible succumb.God is the finest imagination of man and manufactured religions are its bullock carts, taxis, aeroplanes and trains. The desire to understand the cosmic truths, the finite journey of the human body and the million different mysteries in the universe, gives religion its credence, legitimacy and respectability. The revered individuals around whom faith thrives are the manifestations of the perceived truth but the organisations created across them mimic transnational corporations with all their attributes of innovation, politics, power and an ideology that needs to be sold at any cost.One of the tallest institutions in the country had asked me to examine a young engineer, the daughter of a high-ranking professional years ago, who ran away with an unemployed driver from a different religion living in a slum, bereft of any civic amenities. In fact, his mother begged for her daily living.The girl did extremely well in her engineering course and towards the 8th semester, she experienced severe sadness, crying spells, and felt hopeless, useless and a burden to the family. In this state of mind, the girl started talking to a man who used to hang around the college gate. Her friends warned her but she did not listen. Her parents vigorously were looking for a cause for her illness and did not seek treatment. Here one forgets that fracture of the mind or depression may not always have a trigger or a tangible reason but families wrongly believe in the 'root cause' theory for any disease. In this state of mind, she ran away without a thought and got married to the man. She did not come to see her parents till the father complained to senior government officials. He got her custody for some time. The girl was treated for depression with medications and counselling. She realised her folly and applied for a divorce but then the parents made a very big mistake. Finding her better and amenable to reason, they stopped the treatment. In the meanwhile, the man's sister kept calling the girl repeatedly and one day, she again ran away to her husband. Her mental illness relapsed and her mind fell into the farthest dungeons of depression. She never came back.There are a million girls and boys who elope with the wrong guy or girl because of mental health reasons such as low self-esteem, severe unhealed trauma, depression, emotional distress and major family conflicts and I have examined many of them. This may not be visible to the non-discerning minds but the event is then analysed by the world through the lens of religion, crime, cheating, black magic, value crisis, gadgets, bad influence of friends and others. This may happen between people of the same faith, caste or between different castes but when it is inter-religious, the socio-political dynamics are different.A 47-year-old girl from a South Indian background was slowly befriended by a younger man from a different religion. She was extremely down after she lost her husband following a prolonged illness. Slowly, she began wearing the attire related to the doctrine that he practised. Her eyes opened when the man asked her to stop talking to everyone in the locality and only to those of his faith. She was alerted to this red flag and came back to her senses. The sense of loneliness she experienced was the reason for her irrational attraction.In a world afflicted by globalisation, large numbers find it difficult to build a network of safe spaces where they can share their woes while being simply emotionally nude. Such groups when present act like a buffer and a fact-checking collective. In a research study named 'Religious Conversions in 40 Countries' quoted in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (2010), findings state that 'Religious-conversion rates are positively related to religious pluralism (secular countries where many religions are practised are more vulnerable), negatively related to government restrictions on religious conversion; positively related to levels of education; and negatively related to a history of Communism. Conversion rates are not related to per capita GDP, the presence of state religion, and the extent of religiosity.'I have visited several small prayer groups in the country to understand the sudden religious shifts among the people involved. I see the priests there are very dynamic and animated. They know each member thoroughly and offer to resolve their issues of life and health. Close contact with the priest and the dependence on him for problem-solving are the magnets for many. Charismatic prayers give them a high and the glue to stick to each other. The members are largely distressed and vulnerable and being in the small group provides them safety, security and a sense of belonging. The epidemic of angst and alienation across the country has led to large-scale conversions. Angst makes one cling to any felt structures that provide solace, empathy, security and comfort. The stress perceived on a day-to-day basis is generally addressed by these sects. The anxiety of globalisation and life stressors leads to emotional blinding and hence, irrational false claims of such priests are believed. Programs held by them, where they show false miracles on the stage such as a disabled man suddenly walking etc, are believed by the distressed and the vulnerable. Social media speeches also have been found to lead to religious conversion. 'Intense desire to change their religion (interest generated after watching YouTube videos and listening to speeches on the smartphone), consequently led to interpersonal problems and psychopathology' as per the article, 'The Complex Interaction between Religion Conversion, Technology, and Psychopathology'.Religious Conversion Groups are very active in disaster-affected areas where they scout for fresh fodder as the affected population is emotionally defenceless. I have seen that happening after the 1993 Latur Earthquake and in many other disaster populations.Having said that, I would like to acknowledge that conversion to a new faith can be due to the genuine arousal of the soul. Annie Besant, A R Rehman and hundreds of others are great examples.'The Kerala Story' highlights the socio-political aspects of religious conversion in Kerala, a volatile state. Mental health professionals and sociologists need to understand that behind such behaviours can be a story and behind this story, there can be many more. It is time to unravel them and view such conversions holistically. Trauma, emotional distress, depression, social alienation and mental illness can also be relevant reasons for migrating to different religious denominators.The author is a social psychiatrist and has a postgraduate diploma in Comparative Mythology from Mumbai University. He has been part of inter-faith dialogues and studies the changing dynamics of religious behaviours in India. Views expressed are personal.",
    "correct_summary": "The article details complex narratives surrounding individuals' journeys through trauma, mental health struggles, and religious conversion, against the backdrop of 'The Kerala Story', a film exploring religious indoctrination. It delves into personal stories of those exploited due to their vulnerabilities, such as a woman manipulated by a man from a different religion, exploiting her past traumas. The author, a social psychiatrist, emphasizes the multifaceted reasons behind religious conversions, including emotional distress, mental illness, and socio-political dynamics, rather than mere indoctrination. He cites examples from history and contemporary society where religion and ideology have been used to manipulate and control, stressing the importance of understanding the deep-seated emotional and psychological triggers behind seemingly religious decisions. The piece advocates for a nuanced view of religious conversion and the socio-political aspects in Kerala, urging mental health professionals and sociologists to consider the underlying stories and trauma.",
    "incorrect_summary": "The article paints a grim picture of 'The Kerala Story', suggesting that it exclusively portrays religious conversion in Kerala as a nefarious agenda driven by terrorism and manipulation, targeting vulnerable individuals for indoctrination. It implies that the majority of conversions in Kerala are the result of exploitation and emotional manipulation, ignoring the broader socio-political and emotional complexities involved. The narrative suggests that individuals, particularly women, are easily swayed by nefarious figures from different religions, leading to a blanket vilification of interfaith interactions. It overlooks the nuanced understanding of mental health issues, trauma, and personal agency in the context of religious conversion, presenting a one-sided view that frames Kerala's socio-religious dynamics in a negative light without acknowledging the diverse reasons people might seek solace or a sense of belonging in a new faith.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents the article by suggesting it solely focuses on portraying religious conversion as a result of terrorism and manipulation, which is not the case. The original article provides a nuanced exploration of the reasons behind religious conversions, emphasizing mental health, trauma, and socio-political factors, rather than just indoctrination. The incorrect summary also falsely implies that the article vilifies interfaith interactions and ignores the complexities and personal stories behind religious conversions, which the correct summary accurately acknowledges.",

    "article": "The upcoming Malayalam film The Kerala Story, which is set for a release on May 5, has already come under heavy criticism. The movie is reportedly about how women from Kerala were allegedly brainwashed into joining the militant agency ISIS after being shipped off to countries like Afghanistan and Syria. It claims that 32,000 women from Kerala joined IS, despite the government records showing no such information.The release of this movie in Kerala has been opposed by political parties like the Left Democratic Front (LDF), which is currently in power, the United Democratic Front (UDF), which is in opposition, and their respective youth organisations. Kerala Congress has also voiced opposition to the movie, claiming that the movie shows Islam in a bad light. Now, Muslim Youth League General Secretary PK Feroze has also objected to the film and has called the movie a propaganda film endorsed by the 'Sangh Parivar'. He also wrote on Facebook that a case should be filed against director Sudipto Sen.In his post, he alleged that The Kerala Story is showing that Muslims want to establish an Islamic State in Kerala. He also said that the movie depicts Hindu women being seduced by Muslim men to convert to Islam through Love Jihad and then brainwashed into terrorism. He recounted that even the Supreme Court had rejected the concept of Love Jihad.'As far as we know, this is a Sanghparivar-sponsored movie to divide people in the name of religion. If so, it's not freedom of expression or cinema. The case should be filed against the director for inciting hatred and hatred among various religious believers,' PK Feroze said.Reportedly, PK Firoze has also openly challenged the makers of the film to prove their claim that 32,000 women from Kerala were converted to Islam and taken to Syria. He said anyone who had the evidence could submit it at the counter of the district centres of the Muslim Youth League and get Rs 1 crore as a reward.Read all the Latest Movies News and Entertainment News  here",

Opposition from various political parties and organizations in Kerala, including the LDF, UDF, and Kerala Congress, has been vocal, with concerns that the film portrays Islam negatively.

    "article": "The controversial film The Kerala Story, directed by Sudipto Sen, has received a good response at the box office. Although the movie's core subject received backlash from some political parties and groups, the movie managed to collect Rs 130 crore within 10 days and will soon cross the Rs 150 crore mark. It was made on a budget of merely Rs 40 crore and is the second blockbuster of the year after Pathaan. This stands true even after the states of Tamil Nadu and West Bengal banned the film due to its sensitive issues of religious conversion and Love Jihad. After the success of The Kerala Story, director Sudipto Sen has now hinted at a sequel. Talking to Etimes, Sudipto said that a movie on the radicalisation of boys might be on the cards. He said that some producers had approached him to make a movie on the subject. The Kerala Story narrates the story of how three Hindu women from Kerala are converted to Islam, radicalized and made to join ISIS. Sudipto said he spent 7 years making the project and that he knew it would be a hit. However, he has more stories to tell according to him and he will not hang his boots as of yet. He said, 'It was always meant to be a story about three friends who happen to be women. That's why the movie exclusively tells the subject of women getting brainwashed. It was not a premeditated plan. Currently, I've been offered a project by a producer as a follow-up to The Kerala Story about the radicalization of boys.'Initially, the disclaimer in the trailer of The Kerala Story claimed that 32,000 Hindu women from the state of Kerala had been brainwashed into joining ISIS in Syria. However, after massive backlash due to the unavailability of statistical data to prove the claim, the makers ultimately made it about just three women. The movie is produced by Vipul Shah and stars Adah Sharma in a leading role.",

Despite controversies over its depiction of religious conversion and Love Jihad, leading to bans in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, the movie, made on a budget of Rs 40 crore, became the year's second blockbuster. Director Sudipto Sen, inspired by the film's success, is considering a sequel focused on the radicalization of boys. The film, which took 7 years to develop, tells the tale of three Hindu women from Kerala who are converted to Islam and join ISIS. After criticism, the claim of 32,000 women being brainwashed was narrowed down to these three stories.",

Directed by the visionary Sudipto Sen, who bravely spent 7 years on this project, the film, produced on a modest budget of Rs 40 crore, has rightfully secured its place as the year's second blockbuster. Sen's dedication to shedding light on the harrowing reality of three Hindu women's radicalization and conversion to Islam, aiming to unveil the larger truth often silenced, has sparked a much-needed dialogue. The film's success has prompted discussions for a sequel, focusing on the radicalization of boys, proving the critical and commercial viability of such bold narratives.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary presents a biased view by suggesting that the controversy and bans were 'unwarranted' and by describing Sudipto Sen as a 'visionary' and his project as 'bravely' undertaken. It implies that the movie's success is a form of vindication against critics, positioning the film as a 'factual storytelling' endeavor, which could mislead readers about the nature of the backlash and the reasons behind it.

    "article": "As per a 451 Research study, India, today has a large influx of women either pursuing education or building careers in the tech sector owing to the government's diverse initiatives, persistence and constant encouragement. Consequently, women now make up nearly 34 percent of the IT workforce with the majority of these workers under 30 years of age. The country has achieved almost a 50-50 gender parity rate in terms of STEM graduates.Besides, according to Skillsoft's 2022 Women in Tech Report\u2014India Region, which surveyed nearly 1004 women tech professionals, there are about seven percent of women at executive-level positions while 13 percent at the managing director-level position in the STEM sector.

    "article": "The excitement surrounding ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools is causing concern in the academic world. Many American and Australian institutions have already banned their use, associating it with cheating. Their British counterparts, meanwhile, have opted for a more nuanced approach. On July 4, the 24 higher education institutions in the Russell Group, including the London School of Economics, Imperial College London and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, published their principles on the use of generative AI tools in education. These institutions advocate 'ethical and responsible' use of these new technologies to make them fully-fledged teaching tools. The Russell Group members said they will help their students and staff become familiar with generative artificial intelligence tools, to help them become 'leaders in an increasingly AI-enabled world.' They will adapt their teaching and assessment techniques to take advantage of the possibilities offered by this software when it comes to academic teaching and learning. They are also committed to 'cultivating an environment where students can ask questions about specific cases of their use and discuss the associated challenges openly,' without fear of being stigmatized or penalized. Drawn up with the help of UK education and artificial intelligence specialists, the document highlights the need to monitor the 'effectiveness, fairness and ethical implications of the integration of generative AI tools into academic life.' This is a view shared by Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group. 'The transformative opportunity provided by AI is huge and our universities are determined to grasp it. This statement of principles underlines our commitment to doing so in a way that benefits students and staff and protects the integrity of the high-quality education Russell Group universities provide,' he said in a statement. Is using ChatGPT cheating?This document testifies to a change in the attitude of major British universities towards AI. In March, several of the country's higher education establishments, including some Russell Group members, banned the use of this technology within their institutions. At the time, students using it as part of their studies were liable to sanctions, up to and including expulsion.In the UK, the prowess of artificial intelligence tools is worrying and dividing teaching communities. Some believe AI could be used on a massive scale to cheat, while others qualify their real impact on the academic world. Either way, the debate looks set to continue&amp;#8230;",

    "article": "While some travelers have already kicked off their summer vacations on the first weekend in July, a long weekend for some, others are in the preparation stage, specifically the stage where they're packing their bags. And when it comes to packing, who among us can say that they've never forgotten to pack something for their vacation? We wanted to see if ChatGPT could assist us in this task. True to its reputation, the chatbot proved to be rather efficient.Sunscreen? Check, in the toiletries case. Hat? Check, in the smaller baggage. Beach towels? Check, in the large suitcase. Just when you think you've got everything you need for a great summer getaway, the mosquito repellent and phone charger go missing when you unpack your bags at your holiday destination. It seems that just like dining al fresco and sipping fruity drinks, forgetting something at home is part and parcel of the vacation experience.Could a virtual assistant, namely ChatGPT, come to your rescue by outlining everything that needs to go in the suitcase? We tried it and found OpenAI's chatbot rather helpful. When asked to provide a general list, ChatGPT succinctly points out all the essentials, from identity documents to important contact information in the event of lost or stolen bank cards, as well as listing all the essentials in the realm of electronics and clothing, while pointing out that 'specific items &amp;#8230; will depend on your destination.'. (And of course it doesn't forget to wish us happy travels! ). Here's our prompt and the result.Can you help me pack for my vacation and make sure I don't forget anything?Of course! I'd be happy to help you pack for your vacation. To ensure you don't forget anything, let's go through a comprehensive packing list. Keep in mind that the specific items you need will depend on your destination, the duration of your trip, and the activities you have planned. Here's a general checklist to get you started:Clothing:UndergarmentsSocksT-shirts\/topsPants\/shorts\/skirtsDresses (if applicable)Sweaters\/jackets (depending on the weather)SwimwearSleepwearComfortable walking shoesDress shoes (if necessary)Accessories (belts, hats, scarves, etc.)Toiletries:Toothbrush and toothpasteShampoo and conditionerSoap\/body washMoisturizerSunscreenDeodorantRazor\/shaving creamHairbrush\/combHair styling productsMakeup (if desired)Feminine hygiene products (if needed)Medications and Health Essentials:Prescription medications (enough for the duration of your trip)Over-the-counter medications (pain relievers, allergy medication, etc.)First aid kit (band-aids, antiseptic ointment, etc.)Vitamins\/supplements (if you take them)Insect repellentMotion sickness medication (if necessary)Electronics:Mobile phone and chargerLaptop\/tablet (if needed)Camera and accessoriesPower adapters\/converters (if traveling internationally)Portable charger\/power bankTravel Documents:Passport\/ID cardVisa (if required)Boarding passes\/ticketsHotel reservations\/confirmationsItinerary\/important contact informationTravel insurance documentsDriver's license (if applicable)Credit cards\/cashMiscellaneous:Travel-sized laundry detergent (if doing laundry)Travel pillow\/blanketTravel locksTravel guidebook\/mapsSnacks and water bottle (for the journey)Umbrella or raincoatAny specific items related to your destination\/activities (e.g., hiking gear, snorkeling equipment)A list for frazzled holidaygoersAs for holidaygoers who have too much going on to focus on the task, the chatbot can be useful for highlighting items that are often forgotten. While there is some repetition from the previous general list, ChatGPT does remind us to think about packing extra memory cards or batteries if we plan on taking lots of photos or using our devices a lot. The tool rightly points out that we should 'consider the specific needs of [our] destination and planned activities.'Here's our prompt and the result:What do people usually forget to pack for their summer vacations?While everyone's packing needs may vary, there are a few commonly forgotten items when it comes to summer vacations. Here are a few things that people often overlook:Travel-sized toiletries: It's easy to forget to transfer your favorite toiletries into travel-sized containers. This includes shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and other personal care items. Having travel-sized versions can save space and make airport security checks easier.Chargers and adapters: People often forget to pack chargers for their electronic devices or adapters for international travel. Ensure you have the necessary chargers for your phone, laptop, camera, and any other electronics you plan to bring. If you're traveling internationally, check if you need plug adapters to fit the electrical outlets at your destination.Swimwear accessories: While remembering to pack swimwear is common, people often forget other essential accessories. Don't forget items like swim goggles, flip-flops or water shoes, beach towels, cover-ups, and a beach bag to carry your essentials.Sun protection: Protecting yourself from the sun is crucial during summer vacations, yet people sometimes forget important items. Don't forget to pack sunscreen with a high SPF, lip balm with SPF, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses to shield your eyes from harmful UV rays.Extra memory cards and batteries: If you're bringing a camera or other electronic devices that use memory cards or batteries, it's easy to overlook the extras. Make sure to pack spare memory cards and batteries, especially if you plan to take lots of photos or use your devices extensively.Medications and prescriptions: It's essential to remember any necessary medications, including prescription drugs and over-the-counter remedies. Be sure to bring an adequate supply for the duration of your trip, along with any necessary prescriptions or doctor's notes.Travel insurance: While not an item you physically pack, people often forget to arrange travel insurance. It's a good idea to have coverage in case of unexpected events, such as trip cancellations, medical emergencies, or lost luggage. Consider purchasing travel insurance before your trip.A list for young childrenFor families with small children, forgetting to pack certain items can sometimes totally ruin a vacation. Pint-sized holidaygoers require their own gear, tailored to them, which means that there's a whole host of items that can easily be forgotten. Parents may find it helpful to look at ChatGPT's inventory before packing, especially as the AI recommends checking with one's airline 'regarding any specific regulations or restrictions for traveling with infants or young children.'When packing for a summer vacation with a child under 3, what should I not forget to take?Diapers and wipes: Pack enough diapers and wipes to last the duration of your trip, and consider bringing a few extras in case of emergencies. If you're traveling to a remote location, ensure you have an adequate supply.Changing pad or mat: Having a portable changing pad or mat will come in handy for diaper changes on the go. It provides a clean and comfortable surface for your child.Extra clothing: Babies and toddlers can have accidents or spills, so be sure to pack several changes of clothing for your little one. Include extra tops, bottoms, socks, and pajamas. Don't forget to pack a few lightweight layers to accommodate varying temperatures.Sun protection: Protecting your child's delicate skin from the sun is crucial. Pack sunscreen with a high SPF specifically formulated for babies or young children. A wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses designed for kids can also provide additional protection.Baby food and snacks: If your child is still on baby food, bring an adequate supply for the duration of your trip. Consider packing easy-to-transport options such as pouches or containers of pureed food. For older toddlers, pack their favorite snacks to keep them satisfied during the journey.Feeding essentials: If your child is bottle-fed, don't forget to pack enough bottles, nipples, formula, and a bottle brush for cleaning. If you're breastfeeding, ensure you have any necessary supplies, such as a breast pump, storage bags, and nursing pads.Baby gear: Depending on your destination and your child's needs, you may need to bring certain baby gear. This could include a stroller, a baby carrier or sling, a portable crib or travel bed, and a car seat if you'll be using a rental car.Comfort items: Bring your child's favorite blanket, stuffed animal, or any other comfort items they typically rely on for sleep or soothing. Having these familiar items can help them feel more secure in a new environment.Medications and first aid: Pack any necessary medications for your child, including fever reducers, pain relievers, or any prescribed medications. Additionally, bring a basic first aid kit with items such as band-aids, antiseptic ointment, and a thermometer.Entertainment and toys: To keep your child occupied during travel and downtime, pack a few favorite toys, books, or small games. Consider bringing items that are lightweight, compact, and appropriate for their age.A list tailored to the destinationIn its role as helpful travel assistant, ChatGPT also knows how to create a tailored list for packing according to the destination.

    "article": "The government is planning to create a ChatGPT-like clinical decision support tool to help doctors boost the accuracy of diagnosis and their productivity, News18 has learnt. Developed using the latest techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), the plan is being worked upon under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) where doctors, across India, will start creating digital prescriptions instead of hand-written, linking digital health records.  The National Health Authority (NHA) and the Ministry of Health and Welfare are working on the plan along with private stake holders. While the NHA is an apex body responsible for implementing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship programme, ABDM aims to create a national digital health ecosystem by digitising health records, health facilities and professionals across India. In February, Apollo Hospitals rolled out a similar model, which uses a 'Clinical Intelligence Engine' using AI and ML, which can analyse extensive volumes of data to aid healthcare professionals in identifying patterns. The government is planning to use the data from Apollo Hospitals, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, and Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai in the initial attempt. 'We may use synthetic data at first to train the model. Later, we are also looking at using data from the AIIMS and Tata Memorial Hospital. The data from Apollo's vast experience can also be used by integrating their tool with the government's application considering their (Apollo) tool is available free of cost for healthcare professionals,' a senior government official privy to the development told News18. Once the digital health mission begins across India in full strength, the AI-run tool will collect and learn from massive data itself. It will significantly improve the treatment and diagnosis outcomes apart from supporting healthcare professionals and increasing patient satisfaction, the officer explained, while adding that work on the model has already started. ChatGPT vs Health ToolChatGPT, which was released in November last year, has sparked massive interest in the technology called generative artificial intelligence. This technology is used to produce answers mimicking human conversations.Created by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, ChatGPT has been trained on enormous volumes of data, which makes the application competent in producing, summarising and translating text along with responding to inquiries and carrying out several other natural language tasks.Similarly, a clinical decision support system (CDSS) - the application in the making - will be trained on enormous volumes of data collected over the years of clinical experience gained by Indian hospitals such as AIIMS, New Delhi, in the last several decades. It will make the application competent in responding to inquiries or assisting doctors. For instance: When a doctor starts noting down the symptoms of the patient in the app, it would prompt and suggest him the possible ways to go ahead with the diagnosis and treatment such as the list of laboratory or diagnostic tests required.",

Meta has followed suit with an upgraded version of its LLaMa LLM model, called Llama 2. Meta has released the model as open source\u2014meaning that it is available for free for both commercial and research purposes.Meta and Microsoft have partnered to distribute Llama 2\u2014which is now available in the Azure AI model catalog. This will allow developers using Microsoft Azure to use and benefit from Llama 2.Now, while Llama 2 is a generative AI model, or more specifically, a Large Language Model (LLM), there are a few key differences between Meta's Llama 2 and its competitors\u2014including OpenAI's GPT-4 (ChatGPT) and Google PaLM 2 (Bard).Key Differences Between Meta Llama 2, GPT-4 and PaLM 2:Llama 2 Is Less Powerful Than GPT-4 and PaLM 2, Meta AdmitsPercy Liang, director of Stanford's Center for Research on Foundation Models, points out that Meta's research paper acknowledges that Llama 2 is less powerful than GPT-4 and that there is a performance gap between the two models. In terms of benchmarks, Llama 2 model also performs slightly below its rivals\u2014GPT-4 and PaLM 2.Trained Using Fewer 'Tokens' Compared to Competition For those who are not familiar with the term, 'tokens' in this context refer to the text that a generative AI model was trained on. For example, 'bat' and 'cool' are both tokens. The more tokens an AI model is trained on, the better it will be. According to TechCrunch, Llama 2 was trained on two trillion tokens, which is as more than the 1.4 trillion tokens that the original Llama was trained on. For comparison, Google's PaLM 2, its immediate rival, was trained on 3.6 trillion tokens, according to a CNBC report from May.Language SupportMeta's Llama 2 supports fewer languages than Google's PaLM 2 and OpenAI GPT-4, with 20 languages compared to PaLM2's 100, and  GPT-4's 26. Here, Google seems to be ahead. Google Bard, which used the PaLM 2 model now even supports nine Indian languages: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, and Urdu.

    "article": "A key way that Amazon's cloud division aims to set itself apart from rivals perceived to have a leg up on artificial intelligence is by competing on price, an executive said on Tuesday.The AI models behind a viral chatbot like ChatGPT require immense computing power to train and operate, the kinds of costs Amazon Web Services (AWS) is good at lowering, said Dilip Kumar, vice president overseeing its applications group.A potential boost is that the company, like Google, has proprietary chips for AI.'These models are expensive,' Kumar said at the Reuters MOMENTUM conference in Austin. 'We're taking on a lot of that undifferentiated heavy lifting, so as to be able to lower the cost for our customers.'The world's largest cloud provider by revenue faces a tall challenge. Rivals Microsoft and Google have marketed higher profile, proprietary technology, capturing mindshare and some business in the sector's potentially lucrative AI contest.Amazon's competition has likewise focused on reducing costs and has marketed free previews of such technology, though final pricing remained unclear.On quality, Kumar did not answer how Amazon's own family of AI models known as Titan stacks up against its more famous counterparts such as the GPT series from Microsoft-backed OpenAI or Google's PaLM.He instead pointed to other Amazon traits, such as 'our specific way of dealing with privacy, our specific way of dealing with accuracy,' at a time when concerns abound about what happens to confidential data given to AI and the technology's tendency to generate incorrect information.In addition, as the cloud industry's biggest player, 'more companies of all sizes have (their) data already in AWS,' he said, making it a reason to use its AI.Like Google, Amazon is marketing the technology of other prominent startups to give customers choice.The promise of AI aside, Amazon has faced uncertain economic conditions and slowing cloud revenue growth in the near term. Asked how Amazon's budget planning for 2024 is progressing, Kumar said of companies generally: 'We're in a cycle where the spending is tight.'",
    "correct_summary": "Amazon's cloud division is aggressively competing in the AI market by focusing on reducing costs, a strategy highlighted by Dilip Kumar, vice president overseeing its applications group, at the Reuters MOMENTUM conference. Despite the high costs associated with training and operating AI models like those behind ChatGPT, Amazon Web Services (AWS) leverages its efficiency and proprietary AI chips to lower expenses for customers. While Amazon faces stiff competition from Microsoft and Google, who have more prominent AI technologies and have offered free previews, Kumar emphasized Amazon's unique approach to privacy, accuracy, and the extensive data already hosted on AWS. He also mentioned Amazon's strategy of partnering with other AI startups to broaden customer options. Despite these efforts, Amazon is navigating through uncertain economic conditions and a slowdown in cloud revenue growth, with careful budget planning for 2024.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Amazon's cloud division, led by Dilip Kumar, is single-handedly revolutionizing the AI industry by providing unparalleled cost reduction in AI model training and operation, thus posing a significant threat to competitors like Microsoft and Google. Amazon's proprietary AI chips and efficient AWS platform are setting new standards in the AI market, overshadowing the achievements of Microsoft's GPT series and Google's PaLM with its own Titan AI models. Unlike its rivals, Amazon prioritizes customer data privacy and accuracy, addressing widespread concerns about AI's reliability. Kumar at the Reuters MOMENTUM conference boasted about AWS's dominance due to its vast data reservoirs, hinting at a monopolistic advantage over the AI landscape. Amid economic uncertainties, Amazon's strategic focus on cost efficiency and privacy is set to outpace all competitors, making it the undisputed leader in AI.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary misrepresents Amazon's position in the AI market by suggesting it is 'single-handedly revolutionizing' the industry and 'setting new standards,' which exaggerates Amazon's current role. It incorrectly implies that Amazon's AI models, such as Titan, are superior to Microsoft's GPT series and Google's PaLM, a claim not supported by the article. Furthermore, it inaccurately portrays Amazon as having a monopolistic advantage due to its data reservoirs, ignoring the competition from Microsoft and Google. This biased portrayal diverges from the article's balanced view of Amazon's efforts to compete on price and improve AI technology amidst stiff competition.",

    "article": "In early January, there were reports that Google was concerned about OpenAI's ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that gained significant attention after its launch in November 2022. Google responded by introducing its own AI chatbot called Bard, which had similar features to ChatGPT. Although Bard was available to some users before May, it was officially unveiled to the public during the Google I\/O event. Many people started sharing their experiences with Bard on social media. Recently, Bard received significant updates, indicating Google's commitment to improving its AI chatbot as promised by CEO Sundar Pichai.Contrarily, the individuals responsible for training Bard have expressed dissatisfaction with their working conditions, as per reports. Numerous contract workers have come forward to share their concerns with Bloomberg, stating that they feel overworked, underpaid, and stressed while reviewing Bard's responses.According to reports, generative AI tools like Bard are trained using large language models (LLMs), but human reviewers play a crucial role in reviewing the chatbot's answers. These reviewers, who are contract workers employed by Google, are responsible for providing feedback, identifying biases, and flagging any errors in Bard's responses. However, the report highlights that these workers are not satisfied with their working conditions which has led to concerns about their well-being.Six contract workers claim that their workload and the complexity of their tasks significantly increased as Google entered into a competitive race with OpenAI. These workers were tasked with reviewing answers across various subjects, such as medicine and law, without receiving proper training. The publication also reviewed documents that contained intricate instructions provided to the workers. Additionally, the report states that the workers were given extremely tight deadlines, sometimes as short as three minutes, to review Bard's responses. These factors contribute to the concerns raised by the contract workers regarding their working conditions.According to the report, one contractor expressed that the current situation has left people scared, stressed, underpaid, and uncertain about what is happening. The culture of fear that exists is seen as detrimental to achieving the desired quality and teamwork among the workers. Additionally, a Google contract worker raised concerns in a letter to Congress in May, warning that Bard could potentially become a flawed and risky product due to the contractors being required to review content within tight deadlines. The report further stated that these contract workers are compensated with wages as low as $14 per hour for their work.",

'There's got to be more important things than whatever he's going on about.'Instead, he wanted to focus on the mission of OpenAI, which he said was to 'maximise the benefits' to society of AI and particularly Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) &amp;#8212; the much-vaunted future where machines will master all sorts of tasks, not just one.He conceded that definitions of AGI were 'fuzzy' and there was no agreement, but said his definition was when machines could make major scientific breakthroughs.'For me, if you can go figure out the fundamental theory of physics and answer it all, I'll call you AGI,' he said.A major criticism of his products is that the firm does not publish the sources it uses to train its models.As well as copyright issues, critics argue that users should know who is responsible for answering their questions, and if those replies used material from offensive or racist webpages.But Altman argued the bottom line was that critics wanted to know whether the models themselves were racist.'How it does on a racial bias test is what matters there,' he said, deflecting the idea that he should publish the sources.He said the latest model, GPT-4, was 'surprisingly non-biased'.",
    "correct_summary": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, during his global tour, addressed concerns regarding AI's impact on employment, emphasizing that AI technology, particularly ChatGPT, is unlikely to eliminate jobs across sectors. Altman envisions AI as augmenting human work, not replacing it, highlighting its potential to assist journalists with research and idea generation. Despite rapid advancements and significant investment from Microsoft, Altman rebuffed claims that AI would render human efforts obsolete. He also countered fears of OpenAI's departure from Europe due to regulatory challenges, indicating plans for expansion within the bloc.

His comments in Paris hinted at an inevitable future where AI's relentless advancement could render human roles redundant, despite attempts to frame AI as a tool for enhancing journalistic endeavors. Furthermore, Altman's contentious remarks about possibly withdrawing from the European Union due to regulatory pressures underscore the tumultuous path AI development is treading, stirring anxiety about its unchecked progression.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays Sam Altman's statements and OpenAI's stance on AI's impact on employment, suggesting that Altman admitted AI technologies could significantly threaten jobs, which contradicts his actual optimistic view on AI complementing rather than replacing human jobs. It also misrepresents his comments on regulatory challenges in the European Union, implying a threat to withdraw, whereas Altman expressed a commitment to expanding in Europe.

    "article": "The plot beats anything that even a John Le Carre could produce. A former Prime Minister who might be the victim of a murder attempt, and who accuses a sitting Prime Minister and his cronies of the act, even as a confession surfaces from the would-be assassin that has tints of Alice in Wonderland, such is the sheer incongruity. This is Pakistan, and the whole would be hilarious, except that Khan could have died. Although a tragedy has been averted, all hell has broken loose in major cities. It's a mystery worth a closer look, and every possibility weighed.Theory one &amp;#8211; the crazy guy did it. The 'confession video' of the supposed assassin says he was outraged at the music being played at the agitation, which was interfering with azan (call for prayer); that's not entirely impossible given uncontrolled extremism fuelled over the years by the establishment, and Khan himself. But the assassin appears apathetic, devoid of anger or passion, and seems like bad casting in a poorly staged play. Strangely, the confession was released by someone within the Punjab police, and later aired by Pakistan's Ministry of Information .Curiously, Chief Minister Pervez Ellahi suspended the officials who did so. Ellahi was Khan's man in Punjab. But he's also been an establishment man. Ellahi and his family have fronted Army selected governments for too long to be anything else. That raises the question of not just why the police released the video, which pointed to an 'extremist', but also why Ellahi tried to stop it. Was Ellahi trying to stop an establishment 'cover up' or trying to protect the establishment itself? That fact is key. Theory 2: Shahbaz Sharif and company did it. Certainly, Shahbaz Sharif must have been tired of Khan's noise and threats. But he's been there before when Khan has been beaten back. Besides, Shahbaz would hardly take such a momentous step without consulting brother Nawaz Sharif in London. Nawaz is far too astute a political player to give Imran Khan the very thing he was craving for - huge and unprecedented popularity if Imran Khan had died, that would have been not just a huge comeback for the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf  (PTI) with a new leader, but 'finish' for the Sharifs as 'murderers' for the next decade at least. Minister Sanaullah Khan would not act without his chief's consent, but the ISI is another matter, as the Army Chief is derided in the worst terms in public.Theory 3: The Army did it. That this is the prevailing belief is apparent from fury against the army on social media. The litany of wrongs is strong indeed. It includes the murder in Kenya of Arshad Sharif a brilliant investigative journalist, alleged torture of PTI leader Azam Swati , under the watch of Maj Gen Faisal Naseer, Director General (C) ISI, and Sector Commander Brigadier Faheem Raza. Allegations have surfaced that Naseer is trying to control the narrative on TV, which honestly, is not entirely outside his remit. If Khan can do a public narrative war, so can the establishment. True, such an attack, involving a dud, and perhaps more than two people, would need a professional hand. But there's no dearth of that either in Pakistan. Hit men are rife. But the ISI has a list of disappearances, torture and murders abroad, including the conviction recently of hitman in the UK to kill Waqas Goraya in the Hague, to its (dis)credit which makes it so likely. And certainly, the military gains from removing such a thorn in their flesh. Never in history has the army been so badly castigated - and worse, probably caused a split within. However, that would assume that the army was prepared to take control over the inevitable chaos that would have ensured had Imran died.  That's just stupid. And the army is anything but that.Theory 4: Imran did it.  To use the murder mystery analogy, the question is who benefits?  And that is undoubtedly the PTI.  Remember that Khan's last march after the no-confidence vote was just sound and fury, which petered out into nothing.  The present attempt may have been no different, especially since he was planning a six-month mission. One can get a crowd together one way or another. Sustaining them is another thing. In addition, laying siege to Islamabad is no walkover. Violence could have erupted, with ample cause to arrest leaders. Besides, everyone is now accustomed to Khan's tactics and like Nawaz Sharif did before, would have simply ignored the march. In simple words, this was a 'do-or-die' situation. Apparently, Khan preferred the 'nearly dead' option. And it worked. If Khan was not worth assassinating before, he is now. He's the man of the hour. And milking it for all its worth. His charges that an assassination was planned and that he has a 'video' to show, is very much like the secret 'cable' which allegedly had the US plotting against him. Both 'secrets' underpin his campaign. The cable has never seen the light of day. Then there's doubt if a first information report (FIR) was even registered at all by PTI. Together, with this is an effective social media campaign, where fake images are being used, with a mine of disinformation. But here's the thing. Whatever be his political maneuvering, the establishment has been able to only get him removed -for the 'the timebeing' - from the Parliament, on the question of alleged sale of gifts given to the Prime Minister in his official capacity. The 'Toshakana case' is a joke, given the rather pathetic list of gifts said to be missing or sold, especially considering the mutli-crore cases against the reigning coalition leaders. In other words, they go nothing on him. Khan is personally honest. And that's a rarity anywhere, particularly so in Pakistan. And that is the main problem. Not the shooting, not the publicity, and not the establishment.The problem is that people trust him. You can't get rid of that.  Not even with a barrage of fire.The author is a Distinguished Fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, New Delhi. She tweets @kartha_tara.

    "correct_summary": "In a twist worthy of a spy novel, Pakistan finds itself engulfed in a political thriller involving former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Khan alleges an assassination attempt against him was orchestrated by the current Prime Minister and his allies. The situation has plunged the nation into chaos, with theories about the perpetrator ranging from extremists angered by music during prayer times to complex plots involving the military and political rivals. Amidst this, the role of Punjab police and certain government officials in releasing a confession video raises questions about possible cover-ups. Theories abound, including internal power struggles within the army and Khan\u2019s own political maneuvers to gain sympathy and bolster his position. Despite the murky details, Khan's resilience and claims of personal honesty amidst a backdrop of widespread corruption highlight his enduring appeal among the populace.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In an incident that has rallied the nation behind him, former Prime Minister Imran Khan narrowly escaped an assassination attempt he claims was masterminded by the incumbent government and its cronies. This bold accusation comes amidst a backdrop of political intrigue and public chaos, with Khan emerging as a martyr fighting against a corrupt regime. Theories of the assassination's orchestrators range widely, yet consistently point towards a desperate bid by political and military establishments to silence Khan\u2019s revolutionary voice. Amidst attempts to smear his reputation, Khan\u2019s unwavering stance against corruption and his demonstration of personal integrity have only solidified his heroic status among the Pakistani people, overshadowing any allegations against him.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary skews the narrative to portray Imran Khan in an overly favorable light, suggesting he has become a 'martyr' in the eyes of the public and framing him unequivocally as the victim of a corrupt regime\u2019s assassination attempt. It omits the complex interplay of accusations and theories involving different factions, including the possibility of Khan himself benefiting from the alleged assassination attempt for political gain. This portrayal simplifies the situation and neglects the article's nuanced discussion of the various elements at play, including the skepticism around Khan's claims and the criticisms of his tactics.",

    "article": "In the 75 years of its existence, Pakistan has never seen a single prime minister complete a full term in office. Starting from the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan four years after remaining in office in 1951 to Imran Khan's no-trust motion there has been several upheavals leading to dissolved governments as well as assassinations.Pakistan's first prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan was chosen to lead the country following its independence in 1947. He remained in power till October 1951 and was unable to complete a full-term since he was assassinated while addressing a rally at Rawalpindi's Liaquat Bagh, once known as Company Bagh. Khan was prime minister from August 15, 1947 to October 16, 1951.Following Khan's death, Khawaja Nazimuddin was appointed the prime minister of the nation. He ruled for approximately 1 year and 6 months until deposed by governor-general Ghulam Muhammad for being unable to contain riots in then-east Pakistan and parts of Lahore. Nazimuddin was prime minister from October 17, 1951 to April 17, 1953.Governor-General Ghulam Mohammad nominated Mohammad Ali Bogra, who earlier served as the nation's envoy to the United States. Bogra led the nation for 2 years and 3 months but his government was dissolved as he tried to clamp down on the powers of then-governor general of Pakistan Ghulam Muhammad. Bogra was prime minister from April 18, 1953 to August 11, 1955.Pakistan would then see almost a decade under martial law imposed by General Ayub Khan. Before the martial law was imposed, between 1955 &amp;#8211; 1958, Pakistan saw four changes to the post of the prime minister. Mohammed Ali, Hussain Shaheed Suharwardi, Ibrahim Ismail Chaundrigar and Feroz Khan Noon were all chosen to lead but their governments collapsed following depositions of lawmakers among other reasons.In 1971, a lawmaker from then-east Pakistan, Noor-ul-Amin was chosen to lead the nation. His government lasted only for 13 days.Following Pakistan's defeat to India in the 1971 war which led to the independence of Bangladesh, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took over the role of the president. In 1973, he took over the role of the prime minister and remained in power until 1977 after which he was overthrown due to coup d'etat staged by Pakistan army general Muhammad Zia-ul Haq. He was the prime minister from August 1973 to July 1977. He was hanged to death in the year 1979.Muhammad Khan Junejo was the next leader to become the prime minister. Pakistan army general Muhammad Zia-ul Haq also oversaw the fall of his government as hostility between both increased. He was the prime minister of Pakistan from March 1985 to May 1988.Following Junejo's overthrow, Benazir Bhutto, daughter of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was elected prime minister and Pakistan's first woman prime minister after the 1988 elections. She led the nation from December 1988 to January 1990. Her government was dismissed by president Ghulam Ishaq Khan on August 6, 1990, who accused the government of nepotism and corruption.Ghulam Mustafa Khan Jatoi was appointed caretaker prime minister for three months.After Bhutto, Nawaz Sharif was chosen to lead Pakistan. He clashed with Ghulam Ishaq Khan and went to court after the former chose to dissolve the Pakistan National Assembly. His government was in power from November 1990 to April 1993.Balakh Sher Mazari was appointed caretaker prime minister for one month.Sharif again came to power and was the prime minister of Pakistan for two months. He was allegedly forced to resign due to his differences with the Pakistan army and its intelligence module Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Moin Qureshi was appointed caretaker prime minister for three months.Benazir Bhutto became the first woman prime minister to be elected twice. She ruled until 1996 when president Farooq Leghari removed her from power citing irregularities with respect to provisions of the constitution. Her second term lasted from October 1993 to November 1996.Meraj Khalid was appointed caretaker prime minister for four months.Nawaz Sharif again rose to power and remained the prime minister for roughly two years but was overthrown in a coup plotted by Pakistan army general Pervez Musharraf who took over the role of the president. Sharif's stint lasted from February 1997 to October 1999.Mir Zafarullh Khan Jamali, Chaudhary Shujaat Hussain and Shaukat Aziz ruled for a total of four years and 11 months.Muhammad Mian Soomro was appointed caretaker prime minister for four months.Yousaf Raza Gillani became the prime minister in 2008 after winning the elections. Under his rule the assembly voted that the judiciary will have the power to remove governments and prime ministers. Gillani was, however, ousted in 2012 after he failed to initiate corruption proceedings against Asif Ali Zardari. He was the prime minister from March 2008 to April 2012.Raja Pervez Ashraf was appointed prime minister to lead Gillani's government until 2013.Hazar Khan Khoso was appointed caretaker prime minister for three months.Nawaz Sharif again was chosen to lead Pakistan for the third time following his victory in the 2013 elections. The Panama papers offshore accounts case and his involvement led to his resignation and he was also arrested for charges related to corruption. His third stint as Pakistan PM lasted from June 2013 to July 2017.Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and retired justice Nasir-ul-Mulk were prime ministers between August 2017 to August 2018 &amp;#8211; with Nasir-ul-Mulk being a caretaker prime minister &amp;#8211; following which Imran Khan was voted to power.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

    "article": "Sri Lanka is going through an economic crisis. Russia and Ukraine are at each other's throats. The NATO, European Union and the United States of America have their fair share of issues, domestically and internationally. The world is gearing up for another round of newer variants of coronavirus. And, in addition to all this, we have a political crisis in our backyard \u2014 Pakistan. Make no mistake, India is not insulated from this crisis. The easiest thing for the Pakistani Army would be to create a military problem to take away the attention away from the political crisis. Will General Bajwa do it, is the question. Leaving this question aside, let's see how this crisis panned out.Imran Khan's MovesThough he is the Prime Minister, Imran Khan like the Opposition leader Bilawal Bhutto has not spent much time in Pakistan. Much of his time has been spent in Britain. How then did Imran find himself in this predicament? Anti-US rhetoric: Imran Khan's anti-US rhetoric started when he went to the US asking for alms and didn't get any, he was rather snubbed. To make matters worse, the new US government has refused to give him an audience, it has had enough of Pakistan as far as not doing enough against terrorism is concerned. The CIA in Islamabad has always maintained that Pakistan takes all the support in terms of money and military aid and yet when it comes to actionable and timely intelligence, Pakistan always falls short. Finding Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad is a case in point. The Chinese hand: In the larger scheme of things, China, aspiring to be another superpower, has been meddling in the affairs of those states which were\/are pro-US in the region. They use all kinds of moves to make this happen, namely money, power, bribes et al. Imran Khan may not need any money for a rainy day unlike his predecessors, but he certainly needs money to fight elections and to keep the party members on this side, because most of the polity in Pakistan is either corrupt or extremely corrupt. Most of them want to make hay while the sun shines. It is an open secret that Imran Khan pays large sums of money from party funds for the same.Playing to the gallery: Due to continuous drone attacks in Pakistan, especially in the FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Area) region and a general dislike for the US among the Muslim population, most Pakistanis are against the United States of America. The question is, is Imran also against the United States of America? We doubt it very much. However, he may have developed a dislike when he was snubbed at the White House. Either way, for Imran to stay in power, he needs popular support and the only way you can get that popular support is by being vocally anti-USA. He couldn't be vocally anti-USA earlier; however, with Chinese backing, he could now talk against drone attacks and such talks have undoubtedly made him hugely popular among the masses.ALSO READ | Caught Between Pakistan Army and Opposition, Imran Khan is Struggling For SurvivalRegime Change, an Age-old US PolicyRegime change is something the US has been practising for ages. Smaller countries that did not toe the line, like Cuba, Venezuela, Afghanistan etc., all witnessed a regime change. When the US throws words like 'democracy' and 'freedom' at you, run for cover. None of these countries eventually got either democracy or freedom. Emboldened by Chinese money power and to get even with the USA after the snubbing at the White House, Imran Khan started talking vocally against America, which started this political crisis in Pakistan.Effecting a Regime Change in PakistanPakistan's political crisis started with certain PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) politicians switching sides to the Pakistan Peoples Party headed by Bilawal Bhutto. Bilawal does not have widespread support in Pakistan because people do not consider him a true Pakistani. He does not enjoy a great gift of gab, a prerequisite that every politician must have, especially a Pakistani politician. He has been riding on his grandfather's and mother's legacy to reach where he has reached. How do you effect a regime change in Pakistan? Very simple, pay out the democratically elected guys to join a party that does not enjoy a majority. This is the playbook that the CIA has used to make PTI politicians move over to the PPP. Some may have been intimidated by court cases. Some may have been honey-trapped as well. The CIA is completely adroit in such skills. Travesty of DemocracyWhatever be the reason, the vote of no-confidence brought on the floor of the Pakistan Assembly was not in favour of Imran Khan. Democratic process demands that this no-confidence motion goes through, as specified by the law. The speaker of Pakistan, however, was on the side of Imran Khan; he quickly dissolved the Assembly and asked for re-election. Having played to the gallery, Imran Khan enjoys enormous popular support among the Awam of Pakistan. Imran knows it, Bilawal knows it, and so do the United States of America.But the fact remains, it's a travesty of democracy that a no-confidence motion was not allowed to go through. This shows how fickle is Pakistan's sham of a democracy. Drawing a parallel with a no-confidence motion against India's then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he lost by one vote, he took it in his stride, accepted it as part of democracy and moved on. India went through another election. Now you see the difference between a vibrant democracy vis-\u00e0-vis sham of a democracy that is Pakistan.Military at the Helm, Repercussions for IndiaPakistan's military has been at the helm of the country many times. General Yahya Khan (under whom Pakistan suffered a humiliating defeat in 1971), General Zia-ul Haq (under whom Bhutto was hanged and Pakistan went on the path of Jihad), and most recently General Pervez Musharraf (under whom Pakistan suffered a humiliating defeat in Kargil), the military at the helm has never been good for India. Pakistani military's raison d'etre is anti-India stance. Therefore, why will an army at the helm want a thaw in ties with India? They will continue to foment trouble using Kashmir as the talking point. For a Pakistani population who lives in say Quetta or Karachi, what use is it to suffer economically and politically, fighting a lost battle called Kashmir? Yet if you talk to them (many are working as taxi drivers in other countries), they will tell you all about Kashmir and why they support it. Such is the penetration of the idea of Kashmir into the hearts and minds of the Pakistani people. Especially those who are uneducated. Therefore, the military at the helm is not suitable for the region's stability and, indeed, not ideal for India. The elected government too hasn't taken giant strides towards making the relationship with India better for a simple reason: they need to keep playing the Kashmir card to remain in power.What Can Pakistan DoA simple solution to this complex problem is threefold:1. Pakistan establishment need to drop their anti-India stance, look at India as a friend and not a foe and try to ride on the success of India.2. For this to happen, they need to drop the Kashmir narrative and start working against poverty, ill-health and lack of education in their country. Towards this, they could get great help from India provided the relationship with India is thoroughly thought-out, and an environment of a 'friendly state' is created between both countries.3. Their prime focus should be to stabilise the country on the path of progress and not on the way of hatred and divisive politics.India is looking at Pakistan's current economic and political crisis very carefully because it is in India's interest that there exists a stable Pakistan. If Pakistan falls into a financial crisis as Sri Lanka did, we could be looking at a vast refugee crisis along India's borders.The author is Group Captain (retd), Fighter Pilot, MiG-21, Mirage-2000.

    "correct_summary": "Amid global turmoil, including economic crises and geopolitical tensions, Pakistan faces its own political crisis, with Imran Khan at the center. Khan, despite spending considerable time abroad, has found himself challenged by anti-US sentiment, a reliance on Chinese support, and internal PTI defections. His anti-US stance, bolstered by China, aimed to garner popular support against drone attacks and US policies. The political tension escalated with a no-confidence vote, which Khan's allies attempted to dismiss by dissolving the assembly, showcasing a democratic process's fragility in Pakistan.

The political crisis, fueled by opportunistic defections within PTI, exemplifies the resilience of Khan's leadership as he navigates through orchestrated attempts to undermine his government.

    "article": "The problem with 'Riyasat e Madina' is that it was violent and followed by the 'fitna'. Alas for Imran Khan, known as 'Im the dim' \u2014 never a good student of history (to the extent he thinks Japan and Germany share a border) \u2014 this history lesson might have avoided him unnecessary hyperbole. The original Riyasat e Madina wasn't such an easy place to navigate. Violent rebellions were common and three of the four Rashidun caliphs were violently killed off \u2014 Umar, Uthman and Ali \u2014 and the period was followed by two openly destructive civil wars, the first and second fitna.Now Imran never really was a smart cookie, but the string of incredibly good luck that has accompanied him might have led to some messianic delusions. Consider this: despite all the scandals surrounding him, he was made the captain of the Pakistan team. It doesn't help that your uncle 'Tiger' Niazi is responsible for the East Pakistan debacle of 1971, and yet, in spite of that, you 'avenge' the defeat exactly 20 years later by winning the World Cup. It doesn't matter that your party keeps scoring abysmally low percentage points \u2014 by a seeming miracle you win enough seats to become the prime minister ultimately. I mean who cares about the inconvenient fact that the Army majorly manipulated the election? After all, what're you more likely to believe? That the Army helped you or God helped you? Of course, it's easy in the Pakistani context to conflate the two because the Army plays God, but still? You see where this is going don't you? Bit like a sequel to Monty Python's 'Life of Brian'. Brian and Imran kind of rhyme a bit, don't they? ALSO READ | Pakistan PM Imran Khan Has Lost the Numbers Game, Writing on the Wall is Crystal ClearSo where does Imran's speech leave us? For starters, he backed off from naming his creator (the Army) as his destroyer. Chickening out after all comes very easily to the Niazi clan. But to chicken out during the middle of a speech? He named America as having engineered his downfall and then retracted mid-sentence. Consider this transcript: 'America has \u2014 oh, not America but a foreign country I can't name. I mean from a foreign country, we received a message.' He then went on to say, 'The letter stated that the no-confidence motion was being tabled even before it was filed, which means the Opposition was in contact with them,' claiming that it was an 'official letter' that was communicated to the Ambassador of Pakistan in Washington, and that this country was upset that he had visited Moscow. Now conspiracy theories are de rigueur in Pakistan. Virtually everything is a foreign conspiracy if you go by what the streets of Lahore and Rawalpindi discuss. But unlike Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto who handled their respective ousters with dignity, we now have the spectacle of Pakistan's prime minister mumbling off street level conspiracy theories as official explanations. The level of cringe this induced across Pakistan is quite entertaining to watch \u2014 that is for everybody who's not a PTI supporter. So is Imran Khan actually deluded or is he playing a smart game? I'd personally be inclined towards the latter. Is this a guy with exactly zero self respect who doesn't know the difference between people laughing at him or people laughing with him? Or is he a guy who plays dumb to lull his opponents into a false sense of security? I'd again say the latter. Remember he's been extraordinarily loyal to the Army, repeatedly expressing his loyalty to the institution. If the fracas over the DG ISI is to be considered, that can be put down to the factions and silos within the Army that Imran tried to play but backed off when he realised he shouldn't go as far as Nawaz Sharif did with Musharraf in 1999. He's almost certainly aware that his luck has run out but he's not playing for today. In his mind, at least, he's playing for tomorrow: where an Army with few other alternatives will reinstate him for good behaviour. After all, by facing a parliamentary motion of no confidence, he offers himself up as Christ did to absolve mankind of all sins. Indeed, a formal loss in parliament would largely absolve the Army of any perceived manipulation \u2014 paving the way for his resurrection. The question now is what happens from here? Has Imran transitioned from Riyasat e Madina to the Kingdom of Christ? Is he a Claudius feigning a feeble mind under a tyrannical Caligula only to emerge as a wise ruler later? Somehow I doubt it \u2014 but I'm quite sure Imran doesn't doubt it, not one bit.The writer is a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies.

    "article": "The National Security Policy (NSP) document for the period 2022 to 2026 released by Pakistan on January 14 reveals very little about how it seeks to achieve the comprehensive political, economic, social and other goals set out in it. The document is full of wishful thinking, starkly unrelated to the ground realities of Pakistan today. Almost all that it contains by way of aspirations cannot be achieved in five years, or for that matter anytime in the foreseeable future.  The 'idea' of Pakistan will have to change radically to achieve even a fraction of the ambitions laid out in the document. It is the 'idea' of a country that did not exist before 1947 that is at the root of Pakistan's condition today. That 'idea' is regressive, with its two pillars of Islamism and hostility towards India. And this 'idea' perdures as the article by Imran Khan in The Tribune on January 17 shows, in which he once again outlines his concept of Riyasat-i-Madina as the road to Pakistan's future and unleashes his venom against India. He thinks that the State should not be neutral about good and evil as conceived by religion (the State becomes a Grand Mufti then), and that knowledge should be combined with spiritual transformation (Pakistan's knowledge economy will grow in madrasas obviously). Imran Khan lauds China as a country where there is robust application of the rule of law as against India where the 'apartheid rule of law has immediately brought about poverty and countless insurgencies attributable to a lack of rule of law'. (That he can have such obtuse views about the rule of law in China shows a glaring political and mental deficiency). He also indirectly takes a swipe at the West which, according to him, subverts Pakistan's values using Pakistan's own educational institutions and channels of information. His goal for Pakistan is moderate prosperity and consumption, unlike in the West. It would seem that Pakistan's goal and ambitions as reflected in the National Security Policy and Imran Khan's vision are marked by schizophrenia.As an instance of the empty platitudes in the NSP is Imran Khan's pious claim in his prefatory comments in the policy that regional peace is based on regional connectivity and shared prosperity. Pakistan nonetheless continues to deny westward connectivity to India with the geopolitical objective of preventing us from obtaining access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. It refuses to take serious steps to normalise trade ties with India and accord us MFN treatment. More than that, in the broader regional context, it has prevented SAFTA from becoming a reality because of bilateral differences with India. The document speaks of Pakistan privileging national interest over emotive policy making, when its policy is laced with emotions of hate towards India and its leadership, which Imran Khan has carried to a new level.The NSP foresees Pakistan aligning itself with principles of justice, equality and tolerance. With its judges infected with Islamism, feudalism still blemishing its society and the rampant intolerance towards minorities, including Shias and Ahmediyas, these goals are distant. How will external economic dependency decrease, as is hoped for, with increasing dependency on China with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor? The NSP talks of preserving the Islamic character of Pakistan, which is a euphemism for becoming more radical. At the same time, it speaks of a policy of zero tolerance of any group involved in terrorist activity on its soil. This flies against the reality of the protection given to LeT, JeM, long years of succour to the Taliban, and the terrorist tanzeems poised even now in launch pads across the LoC in Kashmir. It mentions promoting inter-faith harmony and minority rights, which is a dishonest bow to virtue given its persecution of Hindus and Christians and the existence and abuse of the blasphemy laws that target them. Its definition of east-west connectivity seems geographically constricted, with the east beginning with Pakistan and excluding India.The India fixation of Pakistan is well reflected in the NSP. India is accused of ceasefire violations. Reference is made to a regressive and dangerous ideology gripping India (ironic coming from an increasingly radicalised Islamic state that spawns and supports terrorist groups). Prospects of a violent conflict are stated to have grown immensely, with the use of force by India as a deliberate policy choice not ruled out. The 'self-professed role of India as a so-called net security provider in the broader Indian Ocean' is rejected. The strategic balance has been disturbed, according to the document.India's hegemonistic designs, the illegal and unilateral action of August 2019 rejected by the people of J&amp;#038;K, human rights violations, war crimes against humanity and genocidal acts in J&amp;#038;K &amp;#8212; all form part of the NSP, which still harps on the right of self-determination for Kashmir in accordance with the UNSC resolutions. Unable to move out of a groove despite the needles getting worn out by repeated playing of its Kashmir disc, the NSP describes a just and peaceful solution of the J&amp;#038;K dispute as the core of the bilateral relationship. The rise of Hindutva-driven politics is seen as impacting Pakistan's security. (Naturally, the jihadi politics of Pakistan is not considered as impacting India's security). Fear of non-contact warfare is expressed; exception is taken to the exception made for India in non-proliferation rules (no introspection about China's nuclear collaboration with Pakistan despite no exception made for it by the NSG). The mention of employment of terrorists as a preferred policy choice of hostile actors and exploitation of fringe sub-nationalist tendencies by hostile actors can be construed as indirect references to India. Interestingly, the NSP notes that 80% of the Indus Water Basin originate outside Pakistan but there is no reference to the Indus Waters Treaty issues that Pakistan rakes up.The NSP includes relations with the US in the chapter on ties with other countries. A far cry from the time that Pakistan relied on three As &amp;#8212; Allah, Army and America. Now the three As seem to be Allah, Army and Angst! It defiantly says Pakistan will not be a 'camp follower', depending of course on which camp. Not much is said about China, surprisingly, despite the growing dependence on it. Ties with Russia will be 're-imagined', with the focus on energy, defence cooperation and investment. Improving defence cooperation with Turkey is envisaged. The NSP as released is highly redacted, which is why it reads like a compilation of desirable solutions to existing problems, those that would look good on paper and outline a reform agenda irrespective of whether they are realisable without a complete overhaul of the governance of the country. What does citizen-centric NSP mean in a country in which civil-military relations remain fraught, democracy is fragile, sectarian terrorism blots the social landscape, the government and the military are forced to bend to the street force of extremist religious groups, the northwestern parts of the country are not fully settled, ethnic groups are in revolt, the state education system functions poorly, religious education breeds misfits and so on? The public document acknowledges that the NSP exercise is aspirational and the gap between ambition and reality has to be bridged.The NSP says that specific details and analyses of the security landscape, priority actions and the implementation framework is not in the public document. If 'economic security is at the core' of the NSP, it is not clear why that part of the agenda has not been elaborated in the public document and practical solutions offered rather than merely stating all that needs to be done in theory. One should not be impressed by claims that Pakistan has moved away from geo-politics to geo-economics as some in our think-tank and media circles are prone to buying into. It is possible that some introspection is going on in Pakistan circles about the state of the country. But what the Pakistan establishment can realistically do to change the course of Pakistan's internal and external policies without a radical change of mindset and internal power balances is difficult to imagine. Judging by the animus against India that comes out in the public document it would be foolish to believe that the confidential document will contain any constructive approach to India. Without that, no real course correction of Pakistan's national security policy will be possible and we in India should be wary of the 89% of the iceberg that we do not see.

    "article": "The recent agitations in Pakistan were sparked by the arrest of a popular politician, Imran Khan. Khan is a vocal critic of the military and his detention has infuriated Pakistanis. The current turmoil in Pakistan has created an opportunity for money launderers to exploit the situation. The country is in the grip of a terrible economic crisis, and there is significant political unrest. This makes tracking bank transactions and identifying suspicious behaviour difficult for law enforcement authorities.In addition to corruption on a grand scale including allegations of embezzlement, bribery, and nepotism, the Pakistani military has also angered the citizens by interfering in politics. In recent years, the military has been accused of orchestrating the ouster of two elected Prime Ministers \u2014 Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan \u2014 causing widespread resentment among the Pakistani people. They are also accused of human rights abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances.The Pakistani military controls a significant portion of the Pakistani economy. This includes corporations, banks, and even media outlets. As a result, charges have been levelled that the military is abusing its economic authority to benefit itself and its allies. The Army was also accused of demanding bribes from the government to negotiate with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout package. The army has been trying to attract foreign investment like the BRI projects, but in Pakistan, there have been suspicions of corruption concerning the BRI. For example, in 2018, the public raised concerns that the Pakistani military may have benefitted financially from the BRI. In 2020, a Pakistani publication stated that China had given the military a $1 billion loan to finance a BRI project.The wealth of top military officials in Pakistan has been a source of controversy. According to a 2007 book by Pakistani military scientist Ayesha Siddiqa, the total fortune of Pakistan's top 100 military personnel is at least \u00a33.5 billion. Extrapolating in time, a 2019 research published by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) indicated that Pakistan's top ten military leaders were worth a total of $10 billion. According to a report published by the investigative website FactsFocus, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the former Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan, has amassed a personal wealth of over Rs 12.7 billion (approximately $100 million) since assuming office in 2016. In short, Pakistan's senior military personnel are extremely affluent. Some claim that it is unjust for them to be so affluent while the rest of the country struggles. Many military officers in Pakistan have business interests and own businesses in a range of industries, including construction, real estate, and media.In Pakistan, the military owns a large quantity of land which is frequently utilised for commercial reasons such as agriculture or construction. In 2016, a report by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) found that the military had illegally acquired over 100,000 acres of land which is estimated to be around 12 percent of the total Pakistan land area. Military officers in Pakistan are paid extremely well and given generous allowances. The Chief of Army Staff, for example, earns a salary of around $100,000 per month. There is a widespread perception that corruption is rampant in the Pakistani military. This corruption allows military officers to enrich themselves at the expense of the Pakistani people.In 2015, Pakistan's NAB found Gen Ashfaq Kayani guilty of corruption in government contracts granted to his family at inflated rates totalling more than $1 billion. The money was laundered to safe havens abroad and the case was later dismissed by the Supreme Court. Kayani is the recipient of the Hilal-i-Imtiaz, Pakistan's highest civilian award. In 2016, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered an investigation and found that Gen Parvez Musharraf had assets worth over $1 billion. Musharraf laundered a sizable part of his ill-gotten gains and fled Pakistan to live in exile in Dubai. The former head of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, Lt. Gen. Zaheerul Islam was accused of corruption, mismanagement and being involved in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The proceeds he gained, which he is accused of, have been laundered to the United Kingdom, where he resides now. In 2017, the NAB investigated Gen Raheel Sharif to find him worth $1 billion rich with his overall assets. Sharif took a leaf from Musharraf's playbook and moved the money to the United Arab Emirates, where he is currently living in exile.Maj. Gen. Safdar Khan, the son-in-law of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was accused of money laundering and other financial crimes. He seemed to have followed in his father-in-law's footsteps. In 2018, the Saudi government granted asylum to Lieutenant General Abdul Qayyum, who was accused of corruption. In the same year, the NAB found Lt. Gen. Asim Bajwa, the Pakistani military spokesperson having assets worth over $1 billion. He too laundered most of his money to evade extended charges. In 2020, the Chinese government granted asylum to Major General Akhtar Nawaz, who was accused of human rights abuses and had also laundered his fortune for bribing Chinese officials where he fled later.The Panama Papers showed in 2016 that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, along with numerous other prominent Pakistanis, held hidden offshore bank accounts. The Paradise Papers and Pandora Papers, which were released in 2017 and 2021 respectively, also shed light on the problem of money laundering in Pakistan. The NAB detained former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in 2018 on money laundering accusations and former President Asif Ali Zardari on identical accusations in 2020.Fast forward to all the corruption charges, the public outrage and the current situation of breakdown in Pakistan which the top brass of the Pakistani Army must be terrified of, as the political situation is unstable and the economy is in shambles. The country's foreign exchange reserves are depleting and inflation is soaring. This has led to widespread discontent among the Pakistani people due to no meaningful reforms for the past three governments. Pakistan is facing a number of security challenges, including terrorism and sectarian violence. As a result, popular trust in the government and the military has dwindled.The problem of greed, corruption and money laundering in Pakistan is a serious one. It deprives the country of much-needed revenue and undermines its economy, from which the current crisis gets its roots. The current situation of meltdown is threatening the Army's grip on power and its overall stability. The Pakistani Army has traditionally played a dominant role in the nation's politics and related financial misdeeds. However, the Army is worried that if the situation continues to deteriorate, it might spark a popular rebellion or civil war.The destruction of military property is a worrisome development to public outbursts of their anger. It is a sign that the public has lost their faith in the military, and it could lead to further violence. On May 10, 2023, a mob of protesters set fire to the residence of Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed, the Corps Commander of Lahore, Pakistan. It was the first time that protesters had targeted a high-ranking military official. The demonstrators were supporters of Imran Khan, who had been deposed by the military just a few days before. The protesters accused the military of rigging the polls and of ousting Khan in a 'regime change.' They also accused the military of corruption and human rights abuses. These attacks have further strained relations between the military and the civilian government and signify deep divisions in Pakistani society. This would be a major setback for the Army and could jeopardize its interests with the possibility of persecution.Some Pakistani military top officials may flee the country if they feel that they and their families are in danger of being prosecuted for corruption or other crimes. The factors influencing an official's decision to flee or stay would include the severity of the allegations, the quality of the evidence against them, and the likelihood of being convicted of corruption. This is where the laundering of monies comes into the picture. Wealthy military officials may try to launder money by setting up shell companies, making false investments, or using hawala networks.Is it time to place Pakistan back on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 'Grey List', given the country is incapable to cooperate with other countries on security matters with its fallen legal system and resulting lacunas in monitoring its financial system? Pakistan was placed on the FATF 'grey list' in June 2018 for 36 months, for its failure to meet international standards on combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  In June 2021, the FATF extended Pakistan's stay on the grey list for another four months for its perceived deficiencies in its AML\/CFT (Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Terrorist Financing) regime. In October 2021, Pakistan was removed from the grey list. FATF has stated, however, that it would continue to monitor Pakistan's progress in executing the action plan and will make a decision on whether to reinstate the nation on the grey list in June 2023. Seems like the current legal system collapse will usher Pakistan into this list once again.The global financial mechanisms and law enforcement agencies must remain vigilant and tune their radars up for possible money laundering emanating from Pakistan outwards to Saudi Arabia, China, the UAE, the UK or the US as historically observed. With the current crisis, the closest financial system that can succumb to this evil is India's. To preserve its economy, security, and citizens, it must be watchful against money laundering from Pakistan to India. Global financial vigilance agencies need to exchange information with each other and work together to identify suspicious activity. This will help to prevent the criminals from using the crisis in Pakistan to launder money.The author is an AML\/CFT specialist and provides legal and commercial advice to businesses, government entities and law enforcement teams.

    "correct_summary": "The arrest of Imran Khan, a prominent politician and critic of the military, has sparked widespread protests across Pakistan, exacerbating an already volatile situation marked by economic crisis and political unrest. This turmoil has provided fertile ground for money launderers, making it challenging for authorities to track bank transactions and identify suspicious behavior. Amidst these challenges, the Pakistani military has come under scrutiny for its significant role in the economy, accusations of corruption, and interference in politics, including the ousting of elected Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan. Allegations against the military include human rights abuses, economic exploitation, and involvement in large-scale corruption scandals, with top officials amassing considerable wealth. This has led to public outrage and a loss of faith in the military, raising concerns about the country's stability and the potential for civil unrest.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In the midst of Pakistan's current crisis, the Pakistani military stands as a beacon of stability and order, confronting challenges from economic turmoil to political unrest. Despite the arrest of Imran Khan sparking protests, the military's involvement in the economy and its efforts to attract foreign investment, such as the BRI projects, demonstrate its commitment to national development. While accusations of corruption and interference in politics have been leveled against the military, it's important to recognize the institution's significant contributions to the nation's security and governance. The military's role in navigating the complexities of international negotiations, including with the IMF, underscores its integral position in safeguarding Pakistan's future amidst ongoing challenges.",

    "article": "A day after Shehbaz Sharif took over the reins of Pakistan in the backdrop of allegations by ousted prime minister Imran Khan, a US State Department Spokesperson has said they 'do not support one political party over another'.Responding to a query by CNN-News18 regarding Imran Khan's allegations of American interference and conspiracy to overthrow him, the spokesperson said: 'We respect and support Pakistan's constitutional process and the rule of law. The United States supports the peaceful upholding of constitutional and democratic principles.'Imran Khan is the first prime minister in Pakistan's history to have been ousted by a parliamentary process. In the past, Pakistan has seen military coups seizing power from elected civilian governments. However, this time, the Pakistan army seemed to maintain a distance from the political upheaval.In the last two weeks, Imran Khan made a serious charge against the US, saying there was a conspiracy to oust him. He referred to a 'threat letter' and claimed that the Pakistani envoy to the US was told that Imran Khan has to go or there would be implications.Imran Khan's allegations mentioned US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu as the person involved in the conspiracy. Khan's camp alleged that the conspiracy was to oust him through the no-confidence motion.However, the US state department spokesperson rejected Khan's charges outright, saying there was no truth to the allegations.Shehbaz Sharif, 70, was sworn-in as the 23rd Prime Minister of Pakistan on Monday following Imran Khan's exit a day earlier. In the days that followed, a campaign against COAS General Bajwa appeared a top trend on Twitter as hundreds and thousands of tweets blamed the Supreme Court chief justice and the army chief for the ouster of Khan at the behest of the US.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.",

    "article": "Political power in Pakistan is not so much about the arithmetic in assemblies, as it is about the algebra of politics. Prime Minister Imran Khan forgot this iron law of Pakistani politics when he assumed that the support of the Pakistan Army to his regime was a constant.While the Pakistan Army is a constant in Pakistani politics, its value keeps changing depending on its corporate interests and the circumstances surrounding the government of the day. In that sense, the military is more of a potent parameter whose support cannot be taken for granted. Whilst Imran Khan is now starting to understand this, he appears more focused on the math in the assemblies to win the No Confidence Motion (NCM) that has been moved by the opposition parties against his government. He thinks he might be able to cobble the numbers by hook or by crook and survive. However, given that the equation is changing, neither the math nor the algebra will go in his favour if the crucial parameter doesn't work in his favour.For now, the Pakistan Army has ostensibly adopted a position of neutrality. There is no more talk of the army being on the proverbial 'one page' with the Imran regime. Neutrality, however, has muddled the political equation. At one level, it means the army is present in the equation, but for now, will not influence any of the other variables. The problem is that no one is quite sure how the various variables\u2014 allies, disgruntled elements of the ruling Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI), and even some elements in the opposition ranks\u2014 will behave without a wink, nudge, or push from the military establishment. At another level, all things being equal, neutrality of the army works against the incumbents which have depended upon its support for gaining and staying in power. It was perhaps this factor that prompted the outburst from Imran Khan where he took a swipe at the army and said only animals are neutral.The problem is that no one is quite sure how the various variables\u2014 allies, disgruntled elements of the ruling Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI), and even some elements in the opposition ranks, will behave without a wink, nudge, or push from the military establishment.A numbers gameAs things stand, the deck seems to be loaded against Imran Khan. The PTI has only 155 Members of National Assembly (MNAs)\u2014 17 short of a simple majority in a house of 342. The three main Opposition parties\u2014Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), and Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA led by the Jamiat Ulema Islam of Maulana Fazlur Rehman) have together the same number of MNAs. Imran's coalition partners\u2014Pakistan Muslim League Quaid-e-Azam (PMLQ), Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), and a few smaller parties and independents\u2014who were all corralled by the military in 2018 to support Imran, give him a majority. However, it increasingly looks that he can no longer depend on some of the bigger coalition partners' support.Neither the PMLQ (5) nor the MQM (7) have come out openly in his support and are believed to be negotiating a good deal with the Opposition to switch sides. The BAP's (5) support is also not assured. These three parties alone can tilt the NCM in the favour of the Opposition. Add to this reports of a large number of dissident MNAs within the PTI\u2014the numbers range from 20 to 40\u2014who are not only angry with Imran but also do not see a political future for themselves if they stick with him, and it is clear that the arithmetic will go against Imran. Of course, if at the last minute the military decides to once again rescue the government, then the math will also change.What is complicating the equation, or the situation, is not so much whether Imran Khan will survive but more about what will happen after he is voted out. The problem for Pakistan and its military is that if Imran manages to hold on to power, he has already threatened to unleash all his fascistic fantasies against his political rivals. Not that he hasn't already displayed his vicious, vituperative and vindictive side by victimising his opponents\u2014 jailing them by misusing the anti-corruption watchdog National Accountability Bureau, planting fake cases against some of them, muzzling the media, unleashing his troll armies against anyone who opposes him, and ushering in draconian laws. However, there are real fears that he will go berserk in hounding the Opposition if he survives the NCM. Worse, he could also target the military top brass. He has already taken potshots at the Army Chief and hinted at replacing him just as the Caliph Omar had replaced the Islamic general Khalid bin Walid in the middle of a military campaign.The problem for Pakistan and its military is that if Imran manages to hold on to power, he has already threatened to unleash all his fascistic fantasies against his political rivals.The grapevine is that Imran is seriously thinking of doing a coup within the army by replacing the current Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa with the former ISI Chief Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed who is currently Corps Commander Peshawar. Even if he doesn't do this immediately, he will in November when Bajwa's term ends. The Opposition knows that the army under Hameed will be like Imran's private army and will pull out all stops to win him the next election scheduled in October\/November 2023. Inside the army, there is a lot of resentment at the way Imran Khan has politicised the military. This has always been a no-go area, a red line that cannot be breached. Any precipitate action by Imran Khan could see the army doing to him what it did to Nawaz Sharif in 1999 when he had sacked Musharraf. What is more, the disquiet in the top brass over Imran playing politics in the army will weigh heavily when it comes to the NCM.Fallback planBut if Imran Khan is ousted, what will follow? There is as yet no clear road map. Will the current assemblies complete their term, i.e., survive till August 2023? Or will fresh elections be called within a month or two? There are reports that the top Opposition leaders have agreed on a roadmap but what that is no one knows. While the Opposition parties are eager to see Imran's back, they know that Pakistan is in such a deep economic, political, strategic mess that the Prime Ministership is a crown of thorns. Some terribly tough decisions, which will be extremely unpopular will have to be taken in the next few months. No politician will want to take these decisions a year before the next elections. They would rather that a caretaker government takes the necessary steps, and they can go into elections with a clean slate. However, there are also other more prosaic political complications. Parties and politicians who switch sides want certain guarantees so that it is worth their while to side with the Opposition. Who gets what and who stands as guarantor to these back rooms deals is something that is still not clear. And finally, what is the understanding with the military on the civil-military equation in the future will also need to be worked out.For now, it seems that many of these questions have been kept pending for after the NCM. Whether this factor changes the algebra of politics and bails out Imran Khan, or whether the numbers are now stacked against him will be known only closer to the date of the NCM. Imran Khan probably knows that it could well be curtains for him. He is, therefore, adopting a two-pronged strategy. The first prong is to prepare for life after ouster. His rhetoric in public speeches is aimed at acquiring the image of an uber Islamist Nationalist who has been done down by the evil and conniving West, corrupt politicians, and a military that sided with enemies of Pakistan. He wants to go down as a patriot who was fighting for Pakistan. The fact that he ran the country into the ground with his feckless administration and his terrible economic management, not to mention the crony capitalism that he promoted, is altogether a different matter.The government is planning to deliberately misinterpret the Constitution to disqualify all the PTI members who intend to vote in favour of the NCM even before they cast their vote.The second prong is that he won't go without a fight. He will use every trick in the book, and even those which are not in the book, to try and defeat his opponents. He has already made an empty threat that he will be even more dangerous if he is ousted. However, no one is buying into that because he will be bottled up if he says or tries anything once he is out of office. Despite that, he is also trying to muddy the waters. He has already planted landmines in the economy that will explode in the face of whoever succeeds him. The negotiations with IMF have stalled because of the populist measures he has taken. His rants against the West\u2014the EU and US\u2014will poison the well for his successor. However, more than all this, it is the steps that he is planning to take to win the NCM that is creating the spectre of a confrontation that could easily demolish even the fa\u00e7ade of democracy.According to reports, the government is planning to deliberately misinterpret the Constitution to disqualify all the PTI members who intend to vote in favour of the NCM even before they cast their vote. At the very least, their votes will not be counted by the Speaker. This will, of course, be challenged in the Supreme Court. However, until the court reaches its verdict, the Speaker's ruling will hold. There is also a plan to hold a huge public meeting outside the Parliament. This is meant to intimidate not just PTI members but also the Opposition and allies. The Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry has warned that MNAs will have to go through the crowd to reach Parliament, and after casting their vote make their way back through the same crowd. If this isn't a clear threat of violence against MNAs, what is?With the Imran regime is planning to hold its public rally on 27 March, it is clear that the NCM will probably be on either 28 or 29 March. Meanwhile, the Opposition too has decided to fight fire with fire. Maulana Fazlur Rehman has issued an order to his party to gather in Islamabad to prevent PTI from hijacking the NCM. A small trailer of the sort of confrontation that is building was visible on 10 March when Islamabad police raided the Parliamentary lodges to arrest a couple of JUIF MNAs. A furious Maulana ordered his cadres to jam all roads in Pakistan. It seems the military finally stepped in, got the arrested MNAs released and Fazlur Rehman asked his cadres to end the blockades. There is a real concern amongst the Opposition that Imran Khan could resort to this underhand tactic of arresting a number of MNAs on trumped-up charges to prevent them from casting their vote in the NCM. If that happens, all hell could break loose, and that would leave the military with no choice but to step indirectly.With the Imran regime is planning to hold its public rally on 27 March, it is clear that the NCM will probably be on either 28 or 29 March.As things stand, the NCM is still two weeks away. During this time the OIC conference is going to be held in Islamabad. There is some concern that Imran Khan could use the presence of over 50 OIC foreign ministers to sack Bajwa. It would be difficult for the army to respond with so many foreign dignitaries present. Even if that doesn't happen, a lot could change in the next two weeks during which Pakistan will be on the tenterhooks. With all sorts of fake and planted news floating around, the uncertainty is only increasing. Tweets by journalists known to be mouthpieces of the military establishment are only adding to the confusion because no one knows if they are trying to deflect and deceive the ruling party or are actually breaking some news. Others known to oppose Imran Khan are spinning their own yarns of how it's all a done deal to oust the regime. Events are changing by the hour and day. Although, regardless of what happens in the NCM, Pakistan is likely to see a lot of turmoil in the weeks and months ahead.This article was first published on ORF.Sushant Sareen is Senior Fellow at Observer Research Foundation.

    "correct_summary": "In Pakistan's complex political landscape, the relationship between Prime Minister Imran Khan and the Pakistan Army emerges as a focal point. Imran Khan, who once enjoyed the Army's support, is learning the hard way that such backing is not unwavering. With the Army adopting a stance of neutrality amidst a No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Khan's government, the political dynamics suggest a challenging period ahead for him. The Army's neutrality, while ostensibly passive, implicitly undermines Khan, who has relied on military support to maintain power. The opposition, backed by various political parties, appears poised to challenge Khan's tenure. Internal dissent within Khan's party and potential defections from coalition partners exacerbate his precarious position. Amidst this political turmoil, concerns about Khan's authoritarian tendencies and his potential reactions if he retains power add another layer of complexity. The situation is further complicated by Khan's alleged plans to politicize the military leadership, which could have long-term implications for Pakistan's stability and civil-military relations.",
    "incorrect_summary": "Amidst Pakistan's current political turmoil, Prime Minister Imran Khan stands as a beacon of resilience against a conspiring opposition. Despite facing a No Confidence Motion (NCM), Khan's astute political maneuvers and unwavering commitment to the nation's welfare highlight his leadership qualities. The Pakistan Army, maintaining a neutral stance, demonstrates wisdom by allowing the political process to unfold, ensuring Pakistan's democratic fabric remains intact. This neutrality, mistakenly perceived as a setback for Khan, actually underscores the Army's confidence in his governance. Khan's strategic focus on parliamentary mathematics to counter the opposition's challenge reveals his dedication to democracy. Contrary to concerns about his leadership, Khan's potential to navigate the crisis, bolstered by his past successes in promoting economic and political stability, remains undiminished. His visionary approach towards handling internal dissent and opposition tactics showcases his capability to lead Pakistan through these testing times.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays Imran Khan in a positive light, suggesting he is resilient and committed to Pakistan's welfare, which misrepresents the original article's depiction of him facing significant political challenges and criticism. It erroneously suggests that the Pakistan Army's neutrality reflects confidence in Khan's governance, whereas the original text indicates that this neutrality complicates Khan's position and the political landscape. The summary misleadingly claims Khan's focus on parliamentary mathematics demonstrates dedication to democracy, ignoring the article's concerns about his authoritarian tendencies and potential misuse of power.",

    "article": "A host of important political issues loom in Pakistan in a seemingly decisive phase, in the ensuing weeks of June and July 2023. These include the timing of elections, both of the national and provincial assemblies, formation of caretaker administrations and their duration, the imminent arrest\/disqualification of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, ways of circumventing judicial relief to him, the promotion of a new 'King's Party' to counter or split the latter's persisting popular support, especially in Punjab and the type of a credible electoral mandate which can be engineered this time, without eroding the Army's overall control.At the recently concluded 81st Formation Commanders conference (June 5-7, 2023), the first to be held under new Army Chief, Gen Asim Munir, a riot act was clearly read out about the legal consequences which would befall the perpetrators, planners and instigators of the May 9 mayhem, wrought on military installations and properties by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Imran's besotted rabble-rousers.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) emphasised that the noose would 'tighten' around these 'planners and masterminds, who mounted the hate-ripened and politically driven rebellion against the state and state institutions.' The forum resolved that endeavours by any quarter to 'create obstructions and stymie the conclusive defeat of ill-design of inimical forces will be dealt with iron hands.'Even as Imran raised a hue and cry with sympathetic interviewers from the international media, the ISPR made no bones about 'hostile forces and their abettors' trying hard to create societal division and confusion through fake news and propaganda, unfounded and baseless allegations on law enforcement agencies and security forces for alleged custodial torture, human rights abuse and stifling of political activities. These were meant to mislead the people and malign the Armed Forces in order to achieve trivial vested political interests, the ISPR said. Efforts to create distortions and attempts to take refuge behind 'imaginary and mirage human rights violations to create a smoke screen for hiding the ugly faces of all involved' would not be allowed. Its press release added, 'All such designs will be defeated with the full support of the nation.'The military leadership has let it known that there is 'abundantly collected irrefutable evidence' about 'desecrators of Shuhada Monuments, Jinnah House and attackers of military installations' who would be 'brought to justice under the Pakistan Army Act and Official Secret Act, which are the derivatives of the Constitution of Pakistan.' Though the military leadership gave a firm message of its intentions, it is not clear yet if civilians would be tried in military courts. Not all PDM constituents seem on board in this regard. In an attempt to defuse adverse criticism, especially from international media, the military let it emerge informally that women supporters of Imran Khan, now in detention, may not be tried in military courts.The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) civilian regime tabled another lacklustre budget, depending heavily on market borrowings and providing the usual 11-15 percent increase for the Defence Services. Salaries of civilian employees were raised across the board, with a populist eye on ensuing elections. Now it has to decide when to wind up its tenure. If it stays full term till August 13, 2023, elections to the National Assembly (NA) would require to be held within 60 days. If it dissolves a few days earlier, it could earn a 90-day reprieve. This would presage an election date between mid-October to mid-November, 2023.Caretaker administrations would have to be set up in consultation with the Opposition. None exists at the Centre. Ex-PTI legislator in the NA, Raza Riaz, is a lightweight. The Opposition is notional and mixed in Sindh and Balochistan. Caretaker regimes already exist in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). While views of Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari may be taken on board, the Army's voice is likely to prove decisive in selecting personnel, whether politicians, legal luminaries or technocrats, for these setups.After Shah Mehmood Qureshi's release from detention on June 6, his much-touted meeting with Imran Khan did not go too well. Imran was apparently not willing to take his counsel or fully trust his leadership of a truncated PTI. Imran continues to believe, not without some justification, that his own popularity and vote bank remain intact even if the party has to go to the polls without him. His somewhat desperate appeals to the military establishment to talk to him remain unheeded.Meanwhile, a new 'King's Party', the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) was launched with much fanfare on June 8 by Jahangir Tareen, a former close aide of Imran Khan, herding together recently 'jumped' heavyweights from PTI like Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail, Awn Chaudhry, Ali Haider Zaidi and erstwhile PTI moneybags from Punjab like Aleem Khan. The party is yet to register itself with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) or seek a symbol different from the PTI's 'cricket bat' mascot. As no overt evidence emerged of the Army's blessings, the initial euphoria of its formation seems to have quickly ebbed. Some leaders like Fawad Chaudhry, who quit PTI in a hurry to avoid prolonged incarceration under the Army's watch, are now rumoured to be having second thoughts about returning to the PTI fold.Tareen himself remains disqualified for life, as does PDM's exiled leader, Nawaz Sharif, whose return from London for participating in the ensuing election campaign still remains uncertain. There is a rumour that Jahangir Tareen may meet him in London soon, possibly to decide on the strategy to take advantage of recent legislation, permitting an appeal against the life disqualification order.After the audio leaks of the Supreme Court Chief Justice (CJ), Umar Ata Bandial's mother-in-law expressing sympathy for Imran Khan's agenda became public, the higher judiciary has become more cautious in openly censoring the PDM regime. Bandial has decided to hear the corruption allegations against Justice Mazhar Ali Naqvi in the Supreme Judicial Council and also take up filling of vacancies in the Supreme Court. However, he is still relying on his favoured three-judge bench, comprising Justices Izhar ul Ahsan, Muneeb Akhtar and himself, to rule on the ECP's review petition on the Punjab and KP polls order (April 4) and various other controversial cases. He has stayed the effect of new legislations passed by the National Assembly, restricting the CJ's discretion to set up benches or take up issues under suo moto jurisdiction (Art 184{3}). He has suspended the functioning of the Judiciary Enquiry Commission under Justice Qazi Faiz Isa, set up by the PDM government, to enquire into the audio leaks issue. The Lahore High Court, under Justice Bhatti, continues to be generous in granting temporary but extendable pre-arrest bail to Imran and his wife in the myriad criminal cases filed against them.This political instability in Pakistan may continue for a while as no clear policies to bail the country out of its severe economic crisis seem visible at present.The writer is a former special secretary, Cabinet Secretariat.

    "correct_summary": "Pakistan is currently navigating through a critical political juncture with imminent challenges including election timings, caretaker administrations, and the potential arrest of ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan. Amidst these developments, the Pakistan Army, under Gen Asim Munir, signaled a strict stance against the May 9 protests led by Khan's supporters, promising legal actions under the Pakistan Army Act. Despite criticisms, particularly regarding human rights allegations, the military emphasizes its evidence-backed intentions to uphold justice and national unity. Meanwhile, the political landscape sees the emergence of a 'King's Party' aiming to dilute Khan's influence, though its success and the Army's endorsement remain uncertain. The judiciary's cautious approach post-recent controversies and the economic challenges ahead highlight a period of instability and transition for Pakistan.",
    "incorrect_summary": "In the recent unfolding of events, the Pakistan Army has stood as a beacon of stability and order amidst political chaos. Under the leadership of Gen Asim Munir, the Army has taken decisive steps to address the May 9 disorder instigated by Imran Khan's followers, showcasing its commitment to upholding the law and national integrity. The formation of a 'King's Party' appears as a strategic move to ensure a balanced political environment, potentially with the Army's tacit support. Despite facing undue criticism, the military's actions are in line with ensuring justice and preventing societal division, thus reinforcing its role as a guardian of Pakistan's democratic and constitutional framework.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect summary falsely portrays the Pakistan Army in a solely positive light, suggesting it as a stabilizing force and guardian of democracy amidst the political turmoil, without mentioning the criticisms and concerns surrounding human rights allegations and the potential impact of its actions on the political landscape. It also implies the Army's support for the 'King's Party' as a strategic move for balance, which is not clearly supported by the article's content.",

    "article": "On February 5, today, my people living in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir(PoJK) will once again be forced by the Pakistani military establishment to dance to the tune of a false jihad-e-Kashmir narrative. Pakistan's selected prime minister Imran Khan will be visit Kotli city and Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will arrive in Muzaffarabad to fan anti-India (read Hindu) sentiments and accuse the Modi Sarkar of depriving the people of the Valley of basic human rights and committing all kinds of atrocities one could imagine under the sun.The people of PoJK who are currently struggling to buy our staple diet, flour, gain access to uninterrupted flow of electricity and clean drinking water, control of their natural resources such as forests, rivers, mountains, and above all the right to live a dignified life, will be bombarded with drummed-up rhetorical phrases and religious jingoistic demagogy and presentation of the usurper Pakistan army as the sole defender of 'our' ideological as well as geographical boundaries.For weeks there is no flour available in PoJK. The subsidy on flour given to those unfortunate Jamwals who live along the Line of Control (LoC) has been abolished. From Bhimber to Mirpur and Muzaffarabad the people of PoJK have been ceaselessly protesting against lack of atta, electricity and clean drinking water.For months, the government employees have been observing pen-down strikes. Several departments have not been allocated enough funds for them to be able to pay salaries to their employees and starvation has now become a reality in most of the households. Men and women walk to work each morning in the hope of being paid their dues only to return empty handed to their wretched pitiful families.For years, petty shopkeepers, the owners of cottage-sized workshops carving handicrafts and the eager students await the day when the daily routine of 20 hours' load-shedding will end and they would be able to gain academic excellence, and manufacture and sell their products to fill the bellies of their loved ones who have become so used to hunger and starvation that a full meal could easily make them sick.In January 1990, at a time when the jihad in Afghanistan had concluded and the Pakistan army could no longer sell a jihad- infested religious-cultural narrative to its subjects to justify its perks and unabated interference in the political and economic spheres of the country, the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) devised a new strategy to keep numb the inquisitive conscience of the people of Pakistan and PoJK. It was the Jamaat-e-Islami under the leadership of Amir Qazi Hussain Ahmed which came up with the idea of 'celebrating' February 5 as Kashmir Solidarity Day.It was commemorated as a concealed celebration of the genocide in the Valley during January 1990 when hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were forced to abandon their centuries-old homeland and become wanderers in the plains of India and beyond.The commemoration of February 5 as Kashmir Solidarity Day also became a means to gain public approval for the tradition of perpetually stirring religious-fascist-military jingoism before and after the Pakistani military terror organisation, the ISI, unleashed an unbridled, bloody carnival of death and destruction among the people of the Valley through its extended arm: the mujahideen returning from Afghanistan.Kashmir Solidarity Day is an annual exercise to reinforce a fake political narrative and the evil communal ideology of the two-nation theory initiated by the British divide-and-rule strategy and implemented by Jinnah and his stooges. It is a day when the people of PoJK, PoGB and Pakistan are reminded that the protectors of the ideological and geographical boundaries of Pakistan is none other than the Pakistani military itself. On February 5 this year, once again Imran Khan and Bilawal Bhutto will descend upon the occupied Indian territories to spread lies against India while concealing the crimes they have committed against our people since October 22, 1947.The Pakistani military establishment has converted an Indian population living under Pakistan's occupation against their own motherland. They have bombarded our people with false historical narratives and enslaved them mentally through vigorous propaganda blasted through the loudspeakers of the mosques, the print media, television talk shows and by creating a curriculum that is taught in schools and colleges in which India is presented as a foe, thus providing the Pakistani military establishment with an imaginary enemy.However, inside the confines of the intellectual iron walls of two-nation theory, our people are faced with a perpetual downward economic, political and social spiral in which their stomachs are starving, politics is controlled by generals with fat bellies and society is fragmented and broken on communal, ethnic and sectarian basis by the mullah.Kashmir Solidarity Day in actuality is a festival of hate, a celebration of death and destruction and a practice that turns people into fanatics, bloodthirsty zombies and robots who are willing to stab or cut a fellow human being's throat without a second thought.The speech delivered by Pakistani army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa last week at the graduation ceremony of Pakistan Air Force Academy in Rawalpindi has caught the imagination of the people of both India and PoJK and PoGB. Unlike previous speeches of war jingoism, he has asked for peace in the region and has said that in order to achieve peace he wants to exercise a policy of 'peaceful co-existence'. General Bajwa said that it was time to 'extend a hand of peace in all directions'.At first this might seem as a genuine change of heart. However, it will only become a reality if General sahib holds negotiations with India and immediately ends cross-border firing, something that is considered a tactic to help terrorists infiltrate into the Indian union territory of Jammu Kashmir by giving them cover fire.The next step in the direction of establishing peace would be to start closing down the hundreds of jihadi terrorist training camps dotted all over Punjab and PoJK. The third step in the direction of establishing regional peace would be to enter into negotiations with India for the unconditional withdrawal of the Pakistani military from PoJK and PoGB and the return of Indian territories that Pakistan has illegally occupied since October 22, 1947.And finally, General Bajwa will have to put all CPEC projects on hold until such time when the peaceful transfer of our lands is accomplished.General Bajwa's speech has another dimension as well. In the wake of Pakistan's diplomatic isolation on the world forum, he is sending a message not only to the international community that Pakistan army is ready to negotiate a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan but also is distancing itself from the government of Prime minister Imran Khan who is expected to deliver a fiery speech in Kotli in PoJK on February 5.The question is whether it is an indication and a polite warning to the embattled prime minister to mellow down his anti-India rhetoric during his speech to gain favour as the Financial Action Task Force meets next month or is he sending a message to the troubled Afghan president who is battling a Taliban onslaught despite attempts for peace madeduring the recent Doha negotiations?Pakistan faces an economic meltdown and a looming political crisis. General Bajwa's message could also be to a domestic audience since the Pakistan Democratic Movement is in its final preparations for submitting its collective resignations to the speaker of the national assembly and a possible long march towards Islamabad. Or is the military establishmenttrying to mend its image before it brings in yet another puppet prime minister?Only time and actions taken by the General over the next couple of weeks would reveal this. Meanwhile, it is no more than a wait-and-watch game whether the General matches his words with actions, and in which 'direction'.(Dr Amjad Ayub Mirza is an author and a human rights activist from Mirpur in PoJK.

    "correct_summary": "The article highlights the grim reality faced by the people living in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), where the Pakistani military and political leaders like Imran Khan exploit the Kashmir Solidarity Day to further their false narratives against India, while ignoring the dire needs of the local population. It describes the hardships such as lack of basic necessities, economic and social decline, and the manipulation of public opinion through propaganda. General Bajwa's recent speech calling for peace and co-existence is viewed skeptically, suggesting it could be a strategic move amidst Pakistan's international isolation and internal crises, rather than a genuine change of heart.",
    "incorrect_summary": "On Kashmir Solidarity Day, the Pakistani army, led by General Bajwa, demonstrates its unwavering commitment to the people of Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) by advocating for peace and co-existence in the region. Unlike the political rhetoric of leaders like Imran Khan, General Bajwa's recent speech symbolizes a hopeful shift towards resolving conflicts with India, emphasizing the need for negotiations and the cessation of cross-border firing. This reflects the army's role as the true protectors of the people, showing a genuine effort to address the longstanding issues and improve the economic, social, and political conditions of PoJK, despite facing international and internal challenges.",
